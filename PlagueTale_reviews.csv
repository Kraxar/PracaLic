"Finally I found a story game which can compete with ""The Last of Us"". \nOf course, for me ""The Last of Us"" is still No.1, but in ""A plague tale"" the medieval setting, the scenery and the story of the main characters is heartbraking, disguting, sad and beautiful at the same time.\n\nIt's easy to play and 90% stealth gameplay, which gives you the possibility to immerse yourself deep into the story.\n\nFor me personally this is THE game highlight of 2019.",Recommended
"If you like Story-Rich games such as To the Moon, Soma, Brothers - A Tale of two Sons, you definitely will like this. The Story is very well written, The Characters are good designed and have really good Voice Actors. The overall medieval tone of this game is also done well. I have not found a thing that I disliked - It was an awesome and heart-breaking experience from Beginning to End. \n\n10/10",Recommended
"A really fantastic game.\n\nTLDR;\nPros:\n- Great storyline\n- Ability to choose your path\n\nCons:\n- Sometimes interactions could be clunky\n- Very linear\n\n\nI really enjoyed this game - the main reason why is the storyline. It's a unique story, which explores 14th Century France, really melding in well to the events of the time and expanding upon them.\n\nVisually it's a lovely game, with great detail being given to the time period, and the various oddities that were around at that point. It was disturbing, but not in an overly gory way, but one that respected death (in my opinion). For example, you could feel that the main protagonist was affected by having to kill people.\n\nGameplay-wise, it was really good fun working out how to get round certain scenarios with the tools that you have, and, especially towards the end, creating a combination of things to get past enemies with or without killing them. One issue I had was sometimes the auto-aim wouldn't work properly, or pathing was a bit frustrating, but that was rare. The game was very linear, which wasn't so much of an issue, but I felt sometimes that I was being forced down a certain path.\n\nThis is definitely a game I would spend money on again, and I'll keep an eye out for anything which Asobo Studio creates in the future.",Recommended
"When you look back at Man's most devastating periods, a common tale told is that of the Great Plague.  Known as the Black Death or Black Plague, it wiped out around 30-60% of Europe's total population within the span of 4 years, killing an estimated 75 to 200 million people.  While present day evidence shows the carrier of the bacteria being the fleas living on the black rats, many people saw the ever growing population of said rats and believed them to be the root of the devastation.  With no science to back up the number in which people were dying, many believed the deluge of death to be a prophecy of God, and some to believe that a certain few could conjure the rats, to dispel non-believers and enemies alike.\n\n[b]A Plague Tale: Innocence[/b] follows such beliefs, where Amicia, and the noble de Rune family stands tall in the town of Aquitaine in 1348.  Her and her father, Robert, are out on a hunt when a mysterious blight is seen in the woods close to town.  When investigated further, Amicia's pet is taken by an unknown force inside the blight, and Robert sends Amicia back into town to warn her mother of the threat.  When she returns, an inquisition has ravaged the town, troops slaughtering dozens, with demands for Amicia's little brother, Hugo.  Hugo has been sick for all his life, and Amicia's mother has sheltered him from the world in hopes to find a cure to his mysterious ailments.  With the inquisition tearing the town apart, Amicia must take her brother and escape the town, and seek revenge to not only with the troops searching for them, but the country-wide wave of demonized rats that have torn the land apart, and the evil entities looking to use their power to devour everything in their path.\n\nAmicia's journey is one of stealth and survival, while making sure Hugo stays by her side.  I'll be the first to say that I've never been a fan of escort style games or missions, but the A.I. for Hugo and Amicia's teammates are some of the better A.I. I've encountered.  There will be several times where Amicia's friends will be needed, whether to help solve puzzles or take out enemies, and I never had any issues regarding their use, which is refreshing with a main character so indebted to her friends.  [b]A Plague Tale[/b] runs a fine line between survival horror and action, with Amicia having her trusty sling to get her through a variety of obstacles.  It can be used to start or put out fires, fend off enemies with a flick of her wrist, and much more.  Amicia will have to craft specific ammo to do these tasks and will need to collect supplies; scavenging for supplies doesn't shy away from taking a chapter from [b]The Last of Us[/b]' collecting, where you'll also be able to upgrade how many supplies you can hold and how powerful your sling can become.\n\nWhile the inquisition will be a major foothold in Amicia's journey, the main course is the hordes of rats that are encountered ravaging England.  [b]A Plague Tale[/b]'s bread and butter is just how perfectly disturbing the rats are made out to be; the sounds of hundreds of skittering feet, teeth gnawing on human flesh, the screams of each rat, deep red eyes fixated on Amicia and Hugo being the next meal: it is such an unsettling feeling.  The looming threat of the rats is succumbed by any source of light being a safe haven, but having to navigate through the river of rodents with at times only a flickering torch to get from one fire to another is harrowing and daunting.  It's such a perfectly blended assault on your emotions knowing that there are only a small amount of ways to keep these creatures from tearing the soul out of these children.  Each chapter is so finely tuned to have moments where you'll be on the edge of your seat, constantly fighting the clock to make it to the next safe spot, only to have to face more danger past the horizon.\n\nBut with all the horrors that plague the travels of Amicia and Hugo, A Plague Tale is surprisingly heartfelt.  The writing and voice acting shine throughout, as each character's emotions bleed through each word, showing love and excitement for their family and friends in between the dismay and depression of the deteriorating country surrounding them.  The pacing of the story is really well done, but I feel the ending is a bit abrupt, with the main antagonist not really getting enough screen time to justify the final implications of the world in which he is striving for.  There are a few blink-if-you-miss-it details that explain in further detail in the later chapters, but taking more time to build on the dream and goals would've helped close the book on a captivating adventure.\n\nThrough all the death and dismay, there is a lot to love in Amicia's story.  [b]A Plague Tale[/b] has built a dark, brooding, and disturbing world taken over by a nightmarish enemy: an enemy that should be recognized as one of the most harrowing and terrifying in recent years.  With all the darkness, a light shines through, showing the power of family: the ones by blood, and the ones by bond, and the will to survive in a world that does nothing to help.  It's a light that commands your attention from beginning to end, and is a shining achievement for [b]Asobo Studio[/b].\n\n[quote][h1]Follow [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/33247611/]A Review Is Worth 1,000 Words[/url] for more content.[/h1][/quote]",Recommended
More proof that games are art.,Recommended
"A compelling take on the great plague with some fantasy elements mixed to it. Asobo Studios might be one the way to become the next big developer, like CD Project once did.",Recommended
"Perfection in storytelling. I love it start to finish. Only two improvements I could possibly think of:\n \nFirst being a more open gameplay flow, as in alternative paths to take or a little more freedom for the player to solve problems. \n\nSecondly simply more games like this. I see no need to reinvent the wheel for every new games, some recipes just work. \n\nThis is art.",Recommended
"Good game! Like Tomb Raider, but without all climbing and jumping and faling ... falling ...falling. And without modern ""you can kill enemies, but you get bad ending for this"". It's just the game I like.",Recommended
"Great game, storytelling is good, voice acting is sometimes off.\nSome parts are tricky, but not unfair.\nOverall I would say 4,5 of 5 points, because the DX11 egine has some bottlenecks.",Recommended
Simple puzzles and a good story. Graphics is really good and there were only minor bugs. very atmospheric. 7.8/10\n\n\n,Recommended
i've played through the first two chapters--\nit's quite decent. I think Amicia is a great protagonist through the story.\nHuge is also to my liking.,Recommended
solid game fun to play with a friend.  great entertainment value.,Recommended

"Good Story, Enjoyable Ending and overall worth what I spent for it so all in all good game",Recommended
this game needs more coverage,Recommended
"I wanted so much to like this game but I can't recommend it for the asking price.\n\nIt's beautiful looking and the rats physics is a very good and original idea. However, it gets ridiculous very quicly with the twirling heaps of rats coming at you, I burst into laughing the first time I saw it.\n\nIt's repetitive as hell and there's always just one way to go and one way to deal with encounters. There's no emergent gameplay and close to no place for improvisation, only what the developpers planned for you to do. From time to time there will be moments where you have to deal with waves of ennemies coming at you where you will die over and over until you know by heart where and when each one is coming so you can kill them before they get to you, it's infuriating. This is poor, not to say bad, game design.\nAnd because the checkpoint system makes no sense you will either have them way too often when it's not necessary and at other times, during tough and long moments, you will die only to realize you have to do the last 10min all over again with long unskipable dialogues you now know by heart.\nIt's tedious, so tedious that it took me more than a month to go throuh it as I got bored and stopped playing very quickly every time. By the way, the game takes approximately 13 hours to complete the main story + most of the extras.\n\nI played it in french for ""flavor"", given that the story takes place in France and it's made by a french studio, but the french dubbing, if not absolutly awful, is far from great.\n\nI see that a lot of people seem to enjoy the game and that's good for them, I really wanted to too, but sadly I didn't. This game has no replay value whatsoever, and I'm fine with a game like that if it delivers me a good and engaging story but it fails to do that too. I found it boring and hard to follow at the same time, ridiculous and highly predictable for the ""twists"".\nMaybe it's due to the bad dubbing but I failed to relate to any of the characters.\n\nNow not to sound too bitter, I have to say that the scenery is absolutly gorgeous, there are tons of visually « wow moments », the rats swarm mechanics is a technical wonder and the music is very good but that's about it and that doesn’t make the game itself good in my opinion. I'm sure the developpers put a lot of resources, work and heart into this game but to me it's not worth 45€ but maybe 25/30€.\n\n\nIn the end, it was a disappointment. When you see a huge majority of people having the opposite opinion of yours you feel that you may have missed something and maybe I did, but it still feels like the game is a little overrated to me.\n\nEDIT : I forgot to add on the plus part that I don't remember encountering one bug during my entire playthough, that's something of a rarity with 3D games nowadays.",Not Recommended
"Nice Graphic, Nice Story, Recommend :D",Recommended
"This is a very enjoyable story rich game. As a person who enjoys the history of the black plague, I was very excited and was very surprised by its twist on that history. Very nice to play.",Recommended
"Excellent story, phenomenal visuals, well-crafted characters and voice acting. Performance regarding frame-rate and frame timing is great and the overall experience was pretty much bug free for me.\n\nDifficulty in some areas in a bit strange and in occasions you die more times than you should, which is a bit frustrating. It's a learning curve though and you can easily adapt. 9/10",Recommended
"An absolute insider tip\n\nDidn't heard that much of the game, but after looking at the screens, it got my interest. And i must say, this is one of the most underrated games I played since some time.\nThis is one of the SP-games I really enjoyed. After a long break of story driven singleplayer games, because the most stories just didn't catched me enough to play more than 2 hours.\n\nBut this game completely got me under his spell.\n- The scenery and graphics are very beautiful\n- It has some kinda darker setting in the medival times\n- The other characters very likeable and you really cared about them\n- The music is beautiful, atmospheric and gives the scenes the final touch, to really play with your emotions\n- Story was very heart warming and the presentation was very nice\n\nGameplay:\n- The levels are pretty straightforward and kinda hose levelish\n But you always got some other little paths were you could find collectables, items for upgrading, some dialogs, etc..\n Because the story catched me, i didnt mind the level style. And the best thing was, that you didn't do any other stupid shit, like in open-world games.\n- The Gameplay didn't got me bored, because you can play stealth or just kill everyone\n But the stealth way, was atleast for me the most fun and challenging one\n\nRecommendation:\nF* yes. If you want a nice story driven SP-game, where you get sucked into the story and always want to see what happens in the next chapter. Gameplay is fun and the difficullty is enough to not get bored. \n--- Most underrated game in 2019 ---\n",Recommended
thats such a good game\n\n,Recommended
"Thank you for this experience. I really enjoyed the atmosphere, story and the awesome textures as well as the design. This is one of the few games I actually finished ;)\n\nPros:\n- Awesome story and characters\n- High-Res textures\n- good graphics\n\nCons:\n- gameplay gets a bit dull from time to time and is rather limited despite the fact that there a quite a few potions to throw with.",Recommended
"As someone who has a hard time finishing games, but was not one of them. I found the gameplay, ost, mechanics to be a nice change. I have ADD and  normal non-linear games always end up not being finished. This being linear made it easy to sit and just play for once. Story line is solid and never felt bored from it. Difficulty is on the medium side, but still hard enough to keep interest. Graphics were awesome. 10/10 dicks up will play again. It doesn't support ultrawide which is a little sad, but non the less was still immersive with black bars.",Recommended
"[h1]Hello everybody! I might be a little late to the party but I decided to make a playthrough on the game if you're interested! If not, that's fine too[/h1]\n\nhttps://youtu.be/r05eYC2tIO4\n\n[b]Now onto the review![/b] Well actually, it's gonna be more of a first impressions type thing and I'll actually review the game once I fully beat it. So right off the beat the first you'll notice is the fantastic visuals, I mean you can tell from the screenshots this game just looks next gen. Its a thing of beauty. I can't praise that enough. Though I did find I have the occasional stutter but nothing game breaking. I think it's more of an issue with the engine though then my actual hardware. \n\nThe gameplay mainly consists of avoiding bad guys and I have come across what seemed like a boss even! Which surprised the crap out of me. But there is also crafting to upgrade your sling. But really what's gonna keep you here is the story. The intro to this game is super intense and has me hooked right off the bat! If you don't believe me, check it out for yourself. My video or some one else's. If it at all seems interesting to you, chances are you'll like it. Keep in mind, I can't really see much replayability here. So once you are done. You'll most likely be done. But the over all quality leads me to believe the game is worth the asking price and I have no regrets! \n",Recommended

Fantastic Game. Beautiful Graphics and Amazing Story,Recommended
"In its current state, I cannot recommend this game. While it does have great visuals and some awesomely heart-wrenching moments in its story, I was constantly frustrated by performance issues and poor AI. I had constant fps drops (every few seconds) and stutters with an i7-8700K and the game seemed to be heavily loading only 1 or 2 cores. I really had to push myself to finish the game because of the lack of fluidity across the board.",Not Recommended
"This game was such a pleasant surprise! The story and characters are rich and the graphics are very impressive for a small studio. The gameplay itself is heavy stealth -- and while it's a linear experience, it gives freedom to the player in terms of strategy/approach to advance. I enjoyed getting to know all of the characters and felt very attached to them as I got to the later chapters. Like a good book you can't put down, I finished this in about 2-3 play sessions. The English voice actors were excellent! It's currently August as of posting this review, and this is my favorite game I've played so far in 2019.\n\nNote: If you are playing Ultrawide, you need to download HxD and make a couple line edits -- Works great except for a couple red bars during loading sequences. Just google Plague Tale Ultrawide and there's an easy step-by-step guide. I would've appreciated native support but it wasn't a big deal to fix it. Make sure you reduce Chromatic Aberration to low to get rid of the blur on the sides of the screen in Ultrawide.",Recommended
"This I will say is probably one of my favorite linear story games I've played in the last few years. The biggest regret about when I played it was not taking the time to explore and find all of the gifts, flowers, etc. I will be doing another play in the future to try and find them all.\n\nThe atmosphere of the game is absolutely amazing. From the woods to the towns everything just looked good. The different characters you meet and interact was another huge bonus to a game. I'd love to dive deeper into the history of some of the characters, but either way was pleased with what we got.\n\nThe story itself I think was very well put together and the pace changed appropriately throughout.\n\nThe only real issue I (personally) had was with the aiming sometimes. Mainly if you wanted to target something specifically but there were other things in the area to also target could be finicky. That and sometimes your parties AI could be weird, more than once had someone randomly run into trouble or get stuck on something.\n\nOverall one of my favorite story games, especially within the past few years though!",Recommended
"TOP 5 IN MY CATALOGUE\nThis game is a masterpiece. From the gameplay and animations to the beautifully crafted score and story, wich simply leaves you speechless.\n\nDont wait for sale, buy this game NOW!",Recommended
"I did not know what to expect when I started playing but within minutes I found it to be breathtakingly astounding. The story is very rich and will hit you right in the feels.  This will make you laugh, cry, and carry you on a journey of excitement. Graphics are top notch you cannot help but take a breather and admire the beauty of the world. All and all I cannot praise this game enough. I highly recommend this game to anyone that is looking for a fantastic single player game with a fantastic story to boot.",Recommended
"Fantastic game, 10/10.\n\n-Smooth play style and easy to follow upgrade system - resources aren't hard to find.\n-Graphics are top notch! (running a 1080ti + i9 9900K)\n-Interactions between Amicia and her little brother Hugo are at times both cute and very raw, but believable none the less.\n-Gorgeous soundtrack meshes well with the overall dark immersion of the game (available on Spotify, too).\n-Not being able to take on enemies in a straight fight forces you to think critically about your actions but at the same time does not slow down the overall pacing of the game.",Recommended
"Highly recommend this game. If you like sneaking and simplistic puzzle combat with characters you feel attached too , this is the game for you. Short game but well done.  I was not disappointed at all. Wish they would actually continue this story.",Recommended

"Story = fine\nBattle system = good\nCharacter development = bearly present\nMeaningful choices in game = none\nMinor bugs \n\nI really wanted to like this game. I love games with a rich story. This game's story however didn't meet my expectations. The potential is defenitly there but it wasn't being exploited. There is no character development except for the first two chapters. The characters dont mature at all, you stay a prepubecent girl with an overly attached little brother during the enitre game. Making friends along the way, kids that even though they probably have their own backstory, it isn't really touched upon. The first friend has some backstory, but after that your friends seem to come in and out of the story which doesnt allow you to engage with them much and they seem to serve just as a tool for slaughter and emotional baggage for the protagonists.\nTheme's like lies, betrayal, hurt and revenge  just aren't being explored within the game. There are emotions behind there that I could feel but the protagonists just didn't, making the story feel artificial and causing emotional detachment between the player and the protagonists. There is betrayal, but very briefly and there are no consequences for it at all.\n\nCharacter A [spoiler] brings enemy to hideout which causes [/spoiler] Character B [spoiler] to die. However [/spoiler] Character C [spoiler] doesn't blame [/spoiler] Character A [spoiler] for the death of her brother? [/spoiler] \n\n[spoiler] Upon taking revenge for the death of  [/spoiler] Character B [spoiler] yet another character dies. Again after the death of [/spoiler] charatacter D [spoiler] no frictions occur between the protagonists. There isn't even a shrink of doubt amongst to protagonists whether what they are doing is smart or worth it. At the end they seem either to be ignorant of their potential failure or to have overcome their fear of death which completely disengages me from them. The 5 kids that took down the entire inquisition. [/spoiler] \n\nOverall the game has good points llike the grafics, the crafting and the battle system, the only two things the game let's you decide for yourself. However the battle system gets repeated often and it get's old pretty soon. The story is fine but as I said not great. So I keep wondering why this game has such a great rating. I would recommend the game to someone who wants to play a strory rich game, that takes place during this time period and isn't too picky about realism, but definitley not at full price.",Not Recommended

RODRIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIC!!!!!! T.T,Recommended
Great game. It is more of a stealth game than an action game so if you are looking for fast paced action this game doesn't have alot it. The story is easy to understand and it gets drip fed to you throughout each chapter you aren't left wondering what is going on. The game runs great on pc I was running it at 4K ultra settings and it kept steady at 60fps. The game has a crafting system that I enjoyed a fair but  my only complaint is that some of the upgrades really are lackluster compared to others so most likely people will be building the same things in their play throughs. \n\noverall in sunmary \npros:\ngreat story\nbeautiful setting \nruns great on pc \nnot bad bang for your buck took me about 10+ hours to beat and isnt at a AAA price tag \n\ncons: \ncrafting system is fairly linear \nstory gets drip fed to you so people wanting more of the story it may get a little boring only getting piece by piece in each chapter.\n\n,Recommended
"While EA says single player games are dead, then this comes out from a small developer - Asobo studio.\n\nGiven the limited resources they had, what an amazing game ! \n\nDecent graphics, great optimization, constantly refreshing game mechanics and above all - a beautifully told story with amazing sound tracks that creates tension and emotion. \n\nIf they had greater technical support, I believe this could leave even a better mark with better voice acting and presentation.\n\nAfter a long time, a game that could keep me playing for hours and still wanting more.

"Well, people said enough things about this game but let me tell you that!\n ـــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــ\n(THIS GAME IS A MASTERPIECE)",Recommended
"This is one really amazing game. Asobo Studio outdid themselves with A Plague Tale: Innocence.\n\nWe follows the story of Amicia, her brother Hugo and a small group of other orphans trying to survive amidst the black plague in XIV century. \nHere the rats are the biggest enemies, they are everywhere and they are legion. Hordes of hundreds or thousands attacking and devouring anything and anyone they can reach. No ammount of martial prowess can keep Amicia safe from them, instead she will have to trust her wits and the rats fear of fire to keep them at bay. Special attention was given to how the rats move like a swarm.\n\nWhile the rats are biggest threat they aren't the only one. We also have villagers driven to madness and xenophobia who persecute and kill their own neighbors for fear of the plague and some soldiers fighting a war between France and England in the middle of the plague. And last we have the infamous Inquisition which has as its public face the figure of the Grand Inquisitor  Vitalis, a old man who has taken a interest in the nature of the plague.\n\nGameplay around human enemies also requer some wits but with a dose of stealth too since Amicia isn't a swordswoman. She is however a expert markswoman capable of killing a soldier with a rock throw from her sling and versed in alchemy. \n\nUnfortunately the (human) enemies IA is quite simple with them jusst checking a area after finding a body for a few seconds (no more than 30) before resume their patrol as if nothing had happened.\n\nSpeaking of the graphics, they are gorgeous, definitely AAA quality. There is great attention to details from the heartwarming De Rune household where Amicia grew up, to the plague torn village and the castle of the Inquisition and to  the forests from medieval France. A great deal of attention was also given to the seasons with lots of changes happening between some areas during the winter or autumn.\n\nVoice acting was also pretty good for the main cast but there are quite a lot of enemies and background chat being voice by the same person. Music served to convey the feelings from certain narrative moments, nothing outstanding but it did the job right.\n\nI recommend this game to anyone interest in a good story which is tied with beautifull graphics.\n\n[list]\n    [*]Graphics - 10\n    [*]Gameplay - 8\n    [*]Story - 9\n    [*]Music/Voice Acting - 8\n    [*] Final score - 8.75\n[/list]\n\n",Recommended
"It's a very fun game. Beautiful graphics, some the best I've seen in 4K gaming. The game is not really a combat adventure, nothing other than slingshot to get past or kill a few guards. Overall a relaxing game to play for a change coming from my other FPS.\nI'f you feel like a story driven adventure I'd recommend it.",Recommended
Great game with a nice story. Worth buying if you find a good promotion discount since there is little replayability,Recommended
"This is a completely story driven game with a big focus on stealth. The story involves the plague and rats, lots and lots of rats. I suppose this could make you think of Silent Hill but with rats and an inquisition in the Middle Ages ? I would recommend looking this up on youtube first.\n\nI enjoyed the game and would recommend getting it (although it can become frustrating if you're stuck somewhere but this only happened twice to me). The game however is a bit on the shorter end compared to other games (completed the story in < 15 hours).  I bought this during a steam sale and I would recommend doing so to others.",Recommended
Worth it.,Recommended
Great story and soundtrack but the English Dub in this game made me physically sick. Play in French.,Recommended
Great game,Recommended
"Firstly, it is nothing like Hellblade. It is priced higher and hard to perecive as part of same segment. Plage Tale is praised for its graphics, but considering game's pricing they're just adequate. Storywise it is typical gamely fantasy mumble, I couldn't see its nor its characters appeal. If gamplay had been fun, story would be passable, sadly it also failed to entertain.",Not Recommended
Quite Good,Recommended
"The game overall is quite good. Worked well on Ubuntu Linux 19.04 with NVIDIA 1080 using Proton/Steam Play. Didn't run into any issues or crashes. The strong parts are the story, graphics and atmosphere. The voice acting is really good too. Having played many stealth games, there isn't anything that was challenging. Navigating through the world there's generally one basic approach to stealthing your way through. Even the skill upgrades didn't really seem that important. However I found the game play quite enjoyable and satisfying. Highly recommended.",Recommended
7.5/10\nthe game is pretty good looking and a Nice story \nand seeing that a small studio am amazed \n\nits worth it if u like stealthish creepy feeling game Rats are surly scary here xD,Recommended
This is a wonderful game with a great story and very good gameplay. i can say that it is extremely linear in nature and there is little to no varying gameplay beyond different tools used in the same instance but the end goal and direction is same. that being said the graphics are absolutely gorgeous with excellent controls. i highly recommend this game even if not on sale some may feel its not long enough for the money but i enjoyed every moment and every character interaction and dialogue. i found myself becoming very attached to every character and actually cared about what they said and what was to happen. check my facebook page pcmasterwraith for screenshots for this game and many others. 10/10 but not very long and again very linear.,Recommended
"The price point can make it a hard sell (so wait for sale if need be), but trust me if you are looking for an emotional story oriented single player game, look no further.",Recommended
"This one was a huge surprise to me. I had seen it a couple of times on Steam, but never really read much about it. I thought it would be like Last of Us and it very much is, just in a medieval setting. \n\nThe first and last chapter are unfortunately very weak to be honest and the mechanics are horrible, but the beautiful graphics, music and the voice acting of Amicia and Hugo make up for it. Can't believe for both of them it was the first acting job.",Recommended
"Excellent game, character depth, relationships and story. Gameplay is mostly entertaining, a mixture of stealth, light combat, and simple problem solving.Slightly marred only by three things: clunky and unresponsive movement/action mechanics, an infuriating boss fight (because of the clunky movement/action mechanics), and the lack of ultrawide aspect ratio support\n\nSlightly flawed but otherwise highly recommended and very impressive for something from a non AAA developer\n\n8/10",Recommended
It was a cool game bought it not knowing what to expect and was an enjoyable game would recommend.,Recommended
"DEFINITELY one of my favorite games of this year. The story was totally unique and I thought it was incredible. The game makes you have a real connection with the characters, and the events of the game become emotional.\nAnd the kid is F***ING ADORABLE.",Recommended
I've played games for a very long time: so I am very critical on what I spend my time on.  But nonetheless I thought this was an amazing game. For a few moments throughout the game is made my heart start pumping and I was so immersed into the game I frequently forgot what time it was.\nThere are quite a few puzzles that you have to solve and some of them were very challenging. When you first play the game: you have to be very stealthy but as you progress the game: you have to become more aggressive towards your enemies and it becomes very rewarding. Overall the story progresses very well and it doesn't feel like it drags at all.\nThe story is suspenseful and definitely keeps you on the edge of your seat.   Overall 9/10.,Recommended
"I really wanted to love this game, but it was just unplayable. The combat system was totally broken, I couldn't get past the first couple of combats in the second chapter because they were so slow and frustrating. The constant whining of Hugo also doesn't help. I get that he's acting completely appropriate for his age, but there's a reason most games don't include toddlers- because they're annoying. I wanted to get into it, but it's not relaxing to spend so much time yelling at my screen.",Not Recommended
"A bit of fictional take on the Black Death epidemic in Europe from the dark times of our history.\n\nIt's hard to write about the story, so I will try to not spoil anything. Basically you play as Amicia. A young daughter of local lord who is thrown into the harsh world of adultery, hostility and unknown epidemic from rather peaceful and carefree life. Story is very enjoyable (on rails, without significant choices) and throws you right into the thick of it rather quick. It's not all dark, there are some fun and funny moments as well. \n\nEnvironments are simply gorgeous with a lot of detail everywhere, most of the time it feels like a fairy tale. Amazing job with different times of year, weather and mood through environments. Beautiful sky, landscape and setting which reminded me of games like The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt and Kingdom Come: Deliverance. Detailed textures on environment and characters with big areas to explore.\n\nGreat work on voice acting as well, especially on Amicia and her bond with the brother. A lot of kids humor, cute moments and dialogues. If you take your time and explore the areas, you are often rewarded with some lore info, interesting dialogues, supplies or collectibles.\n\nGame has some RPG elements and character development as well. You often find different ingredients on your journey. Most ingredients can be combined into usable items that can help you with different tasks, challenges and obstacles. You can also improve some of your equipment as well. Resources are very limited so make the most of it and explore more if you're running low. Personally I found the balance of scavenging, crafting and exploration to be linked rather nicely.\n\nCombat is mostly ranged with a lot of things you can throw, distract enemies or complete puzzles, challenges. Being pretty much kids, any enemy who gets in melee range will often kill you so you tend to stay as stealthy as possible. Large portion of the game is spent evading and sneaking around so if it's not something you're good at, you might reconsider.\n\nPerformance wise, game runs alright but not ideal. I have FX-8350, 16GB, GTX970, SSD. On above recommended hardware I couldn't keep 60 fps on 1080p, high settings, so I ended up playing in 720p windowed. By default game set me to ultra which was dipping into 30 fps, so you need quite beefy or rather new computer for this game.\n\nIn any case it wasn't an issue, as I get older I notice I've been playing most games in 720p window, so it's more comfortable to view. I didn't encounter any errors or bugs, overall game worked well.\n\nWould be interesting to see if developers will continue the story, however it's not likely to happen. Overall, you are looking at somewhere from 20 to 30 hours of gameplay.\n\nEnjoy!",Recommended
"Excellent story-driven adventure. \n\nAs you can see from the preview images, A Plague Tale takes place during a massive plague. I really enjoyed how it was quite low-fantasy except for the hordes of unstoppable rats ravaging everything. Other than that, you've got a sling and your wits. \n\nThis is different from other stealthy adventure experiences because for a huge amount of the game, you're pulling your sick brother around. He can't run fast. He can't vault ledges on his own. Overall he's just a handicap, but it makes for a lot of interesting dynamics. There are times when obviously this makes things harder, but there are also a lot of unique scenarios where controlling 2 or even more people at a time makes for interesting puzzles. I think Asobo Studio saw this handicap could be annoying to some people, and did a really good job keeping it interesting and unique by using it to sculpt their level designs in a proactive way rather than restrictive. \n\nThe graphics are quite good. I see a lot of people praising the graphics, and they are good, but I think the slight stylization to make it a little more dramatic also pushes the visuals very well. \n\nI was also really impressed with the sound. I loved the subdued classical music. I'm no classical music aficionado, but it did feel like proper ancient European music to me. There weren't any pieces that had me particularly riled up like, ""Oh, I've gotta have this song and blast it on my way to work,"" but the soundtrack fits perfectly in an ancient setting. The writing and voice acting was also stellar. I love their French English and how it's just a little unnatural compared to native speakers. It also makes the characters' dialogues feel more pure because when they speak simply there's no way to beat around the bush. \n\nReally a great game that deserves more recognition. Definitely pick it up if you are into story-driven games.",Recommended

"The subtitle of ""Innocence"" is not just there for show.\n\nIt is a gripping tale of the strength and determination unique only to souls that couldn't possibly know better. The story unfolds with absolutely perfect pacing, coupled with a captivating soundtrack.

"The first 6 hours were interesting. The story and game-play were new and interesting. After 6 hours the game became more and more and more annoying with each repetitive sneak, shoot, sneak throw, sneak, run mission. Every character affected by the story means very little to me as everyone aside from the main two characters are very shallow and tag in and tag out frequently. The way the game was portraying things, it was not only not shocking, but had me rolling my eyes[spoiler] That Hugo had some sort of ""power""	[/spoiler]. From the onset I was waiting for it, and when it came I was still annoyed. The secondary boss battle at the end was tedious and mostly just annoying as was the lead up to the main boss battle and that battle as well. \n\nI feel i got somewhat of the wrong impression going into this game. It turned out to be a stealth focused game with story elements, rather than a story focused game with stealth elements. \n\nEdit: Also, the game struggled at times maintaining 30fps at 1080p using an nvidia 1080 and an i7 processor. Cutscenes are not prerendered so they also suffered frame issues, which was quite annoying.\n\nFor $45 dollars, i regret so much that i bought this. I genuinely googled how many more chapter there were at one point, cause i was just so ready for it to be over. 6 hours of fun, 12 hours of playtime, one cannot justify dropping $45 on something like that. Knowing what i know now i probably wouldn't bother playing the game for free, but if i had to attach a fair price to it, i would say $15 seems like a fair price for what the game offers.",Not Recommended

This has been my favorite game to date.  I love story driven games and while this story is not complex it is a great tale that allows you to become invested in the characters.  A lot of thought went into how the characters act as they don't feel like kids written from an adult view but what you see kids act like.  The environment is well done and it is a beautiful game with an amazing soundtrack.,Recommended

"I wish there was an option other than 'No' or 'Yes'.  This game has gorgeous visuals, excellent voice acting, and a compelling drama to it that made me keep playing long after I was bored of the simplistic and stale mechanics.  Which was, unfortunately, about five minutes into the game.  Eventually I did give up when the game put me in the most unoriginal and tedious ""sneak past patrolling guards"" bit for the 3rd time in a row and I realized that I had no interest in waiting to see if they would come up with something new or interesting(using a torch to hold back darkness definitely doesn't count despite being well-visualized with rats).  \n\nThe sound design works quite well, as does pretty much every part of this ""game"" except the game part.  Which is why I wish I could pick something other than ""yes"" or ""no"".  If you're looking for a visual novel or interactive movie then this game will probably scratch that itch for you.  I was looking for a game and did not find it here, and so I recommend ""no"" for others like me despite the many fine qualities this game has.\n",Not Recommended

"A Plague Tale: Innocence is a perfect example of Steam's Yes/No review system being too limited. While it is a unique game, with an interesting premise and some really good setpieces, it is let down by some questionable design decisions, underwhelming story and annoying characters. It's not a terrible game, fun can be had at times, but I wouldn't exactly call it worth the full price - if you really want it, wait for a deep discount.\n\nPros:\n+ Beginning of the game is pretty good, mostly due to the freshness of the premise\n+ Rat swarms are an interesting opponent (and sometimes a tool)\n+ Pretty decent atmosphere (most of the time).\n+ Some areas of the game are very impressive graphically, particularly the towns/villages\n+ Great music and ambient sounds\n\nCons:\n- Best thing that can be said about the story is that it's... serviceable.\n- Nearly all of the 'good' characters are incredibly annoying and unlikeable; it's hard to care about them at all.\n- Vast majority of the dialogue is cringeworthy.\n- Semi-frequent framerate drops on a pretty beefy PC (6-core CPU/1080 Ti)\n- Gameplay-wise, the game progressively falls off with new tools and upgrades being acquired, as they trivialize most of the obstacles put in front of the player. The game becomes less about finding ways to overcome the challenges and more about resource management of various ammo types and upgrade materials.\n- The fact that the protagonist is introduced as a naive and innocent teenager who breaks down after killing her first person but then quickly moves on to gunning down groups of armed soldiers with the efficiency worthy of a T-800 is really jarring in a game which puts such an emphasis on atmosphere and character emotions.\n- As a result, approach to dealing with human enemies shifts from ""avoid/outsmart to survive"" to ""murder as quickly as possible and move on"".\n- Some of the design decisions are illogical and clearly forced for the sake of adding a challenge. Why can't I take the torch with me after climbing up an object? There's no logical explanation other than ""because we said so"".\n- Automated checkpoint system in a game full of instant-death mechanics? Fuck off.",Not Recommended

"Gameplay was alright, you have some options for how to get around enemies or fight them, but I don't think it's possible to do a passive run.

Beautiful game. It has dynamic and relaxing parts when you can enjoy surrounding word. I agree with some people that walkthrough can be straightforward.

"Family means nobody is left behind\n\nSet in 14th century Europe in the midst of the black plague, A Plague Tale tells the story of two orphans, and how they survive against all odds. The game starts in a forest, with a nice father-daughter bonding session. It doesn’t take long before things start going downhill, and our duo finds itself on the run from the Inquistion while also having to avoid the deadly plague. Amicia, the elder sister and Hugo, the younger brother have never really spoken or spent time with each other but Amicia is forced to act as Hugo’s guardian angel due to these unforeseen circumstances.\n\nThe game has a linear gameplay, like The Last of Us. It has portions that can only be passed with stealth and some mild combat all while guiding your little brother and helping him overcome obstacles. Playing as Amicia makes you feel vulnerable since if you’re caught sneaking, you’re pretty much dead. Guns aren’t common in the 14th century, so Amicia has a slingshot instead. However, here’s the catch, the slingshot is a crude one and it will alert people nearby when used, so Amicia must be cautious when choosing between using the slingshot or just throwing a rock as a distraction. Throughout the game, Amicia learns alchemist abilities that helps you get past the rats and in some cases, even the guards. The game has a crafting mechanic to upgrade you equipment so you make less noise, carry more equipment and such, again very similar to The Last of Us. There are also a few puzzle sections that you can get past with the help of your companions.\n\nThe graphics are drop dead gorgeous. Asobo Studios have really managed to capture the 14th century atmosphere. Plague infested bodies everywhere, murky waters and a bleak atmosphere, A Plague Tale does a really good job of making the player feel the tension in the air. \n\nVerdict: \nA Plague Tale: Innocence does an amazing job in the story department. In the age of declining single player games, games like this prove why single player isn’t dead yet. However, the gameplay falls a bit short and feels a little too guided. If you want a heart-touching story with amazing visuals, this is a must play \n\n7.5/10\n",Recommended

"A Plague Tale: Innocence is one of the most important games of 2019. It shows with care and commitment a AA studio can release a AAA game, with amazing graphics, an emotional story, and enjoyable gameplay mechanics. The story is depressing the whole way through, and a couple times throughout is quite the tear jerker. It's about ~12 hours in length, with great pacing to keep you on the edge of your seat the whole way through. One of my favorite things about this game, is at one point the game mechanic you're taught the whole game, is thrown out the window and flipped on its head. That is all I will say to avoid spoiling anything, and I recommend you experience this one yourself.",Recommended

A game from 2019 and no nativ widescreen support. 21:9 ratios just possible by changing the exe file with a hex editor. Steering is total influenced from xbox & ps4 than made for pc.

"Not a bad game, but overrated. The story is pretty decent for the most part, and the gameplay has you figuring out how to solve puzzles so to speak. Graphics are pretty good, and it's a decent package overall. But the story never really explains itself well and the ending builds up a lot of anticipation to only fall over on it's face. Got through the game in about 10 hours, and I can say for sure it is not as good as Hellblade Senua's Sacrifice. This is a game you should check out if it's on a 50% off or more sale, because it's not worth sticker price.",Not Recommended

"Asobo created a masterpiece with this game - characters, voice acting, storytelling, environments, soundtrack and story length. I struggled to put this game down due to how immersive the game was.\nFor a 2019 game, I could run this unlocked at 60fps on my 1050Ti at mostly High settings with a 1080p res. You'll most likely only get two playthroughs from this - since there's no difficulty setting to choose from, and to get all collectables and achievements - but the game is absolutely worth buying near full-price.",Recommended

As I started the game with this peacefull intro overflowing of innoncence, I was aspecting.. to avoid the black plague.\n\nOH BOI... How wrong I was, I had no idea in what kind of crap I am when I throw some stones aiming for apples.\n\nI usually don't like games and movies driven by childrens, but Amicia & Hugo got something... Interesting enough to tease my curiosity, probably because of the artistic direction and screenwriting choices. \nThe story is driven by two children ? Yes.\nAre Amicia & Hugo innocent ? Sure enough !\nThe game assumes its theme, having no shame to take away innonce of those poor kids. Rats eating alive people, piles of flesh everywhere and on top of that you are being chased by the Inquisition.\nIn such a world of brutality, you would aspect people acting as a core against the threat. Again, wrong ! People go crasy making things even worst, but this is nothing compare to Vitalis, the Grand Inquisitor. That guy is going nuts, no one else in this story is insane as he is.\n\nAfter all this game is a real surprise, first time I buy a game by watching 10 seconds on a trailer and now part of what I consider my top 3 games so far.",Recommended

"It's not fair bruvs, it's not fair. The Witcher 3 was supposed to look this good...\n\nAnyways, this game is extremely great. Great story, great graphics, great sound and voice acting, and great gameplay. I finished Hellblade a few weeks ago and wasn't really impressed with it given all the praise it got. This game is FAR FAR better than Hellblade. That's mainly since there is actual gameplay mechanics and not just hack and slash with simply puzzles. \n\nFirst, this primarily a stealthing game with combat with your slingshot. However, the mechanics are fairly in-depth as you gain more ammo and abilities. Hit a dude with a rock in the head, he's down. Then they have helmets... so you make an acid to fling at them and they remove their helmet, then you hit him in the head with a rock. Then you upgrade your sling so a rock will knock off their helmets. There is strategy in most situations. It never gets dull. Think Assassin's Creed type of stealthing, but it works well. It rarely if ever got frustrating.\n\nThe story is the main draw (other than the production values). It's fairly grounded, but towards the end it really gets a bit fantastical while still feeling realistic or remotely plausible. Since this game is only $45, I was expecting it to be like 6 hours. When I thought it was concluding, I was only around 60% done. Towards the last half of the story, some of the motivations and stuff weren't explained really well and didn't make much sense until the end. So, the story is really good and original... way better than ""muh mental health..."" in Hellblade. It's a full-fledged adventure, no sequel or DLC-bait. It beat it in about 14 hours.\n\nProduction value wise, absolutely great. Easily of of the best looking games ever made... if not the best. Better than Kingdom Come Deliverance, better than Hellblade, better than any console-exclusive games. Honestly, I haven't seen a recent game that looks this good. It's also very well optimized. Max it all out except Shadow Maps and AA if you want to gain some fps. It doesn't support ultra-wide resolutions though, so you can hack the exe, but there are some glitches when doing that. I just played it in the pleb 16 by 9 aspect ratio.\n\nThe audio is also really good. The voice acting is excellent. The only gripe was that the surround placement and sound-stage wasn't the best. The music is great too, very fitting and effective in conveying the mood of the scene.\n\nHellblade was sort of meh, so I picked this up and was blown away. Very immersive and entertaining. Worth the full price. It's fairly linear, but there are multiple ways to attack the stealthing and combat sections. Why no mainstream publications are really covering this game is beyond me.\n\nIt's not ""woke,"" so no black 14th century french trannies or disguised criticism of President Trump or B.S. feminism... maybe that's why it didn't get covered more...\n\nAny who, it's an easy buy.",Recommended
"Already finished it on Origin via EA Access, bought it again to support the Devs.\n\nReally great game. Story only takes around 10h, but these 10h actually deliver.

You will mainly stealth around the game, which actually fits to the atmosphere of the game.\n\nSo here... take my coins again Asobo Studio",Recommended

"Plague Tale has a decent story with great background music and in game graphics that are leagues ahead of most, however there's a few things I thought were iffy towards the end of the story.\n\nIt starts out perfect. It's a brother and sister fleeing their home after it gets sacked. A mysterious plague with rats appears at the same time which gives the impression that it will be about the black plague which popped up during the Hundreds Year War, which the game is set in. The boy is innocent enough to not realize how bad things are, while his sister tries to keep things together. It starts off as a stealth game since the girl can't take soldiers on.\n\nHowever, towards the mid game the rats become more of a silly do-not-touch mechanic and the soldiers are just targets. The plague and sickness becomes largely irrelevant and just a detail nobody acknowledges. The game is still fun and there are still moments but if you are hoping for a game that focuses on reality and plausible scenarios you will be disappointed. \n\nI will also say, I'm not sure if it was the intent but the story feels similar to a lot of teen-action movies that have popped up the last several years. All of the protaganists are kids who lost their parents. All of the bad guys are grown ups with a deranged and dark idea of how the world works. It doesn't affect the gameplay, but I thought it was a little silly in retrospect.\n\nDo not expect a difficult experience. Most of the gameplay is centered on piecing together the correct combinations of ammo and timing for puzzles. Most of the time there's multiple ways to approach problems. I died quite a lot but it was always because of my own super obvious mistake. \n\nOverall I'd recommend the game -- on sale. It's an enjoyable game to play for the story itself and is a break from intense games that require pinpoint perfect execution after a thousand tries. It's very pretty to look, and while it's dark and gritty, it doesn't ever try to gross out the player or shock them with obscene violence.",Recommended

"I finished this game about a month ago, and I keep finding myself thinking about the game and wanting to play it again.  It was a really great narrative experience, and some of the gameplay features were really interesting and fun to do.  That being said, there was some of the gameplay that was really clunky and hard to get used to, but once you learned it's very specific rules it did become a bit easier.  I did die a lot of times just because the controls weren't responding or the enemy ai would randomly turn around to see me when I had supposedly distracted them already.  But even with some annoying parts like that, I really enjoyed the game overall, and would highly recommend playing it if you like the single player narrative experience.",Recommended

"OK, now that I have beat the game, here is an updated review of my experiences. \n\nThe best part of this game is the story. It really is a legendary and memorable experience. I haven't really felt this way since playing the Witcher 3.\n\nThe graphics are superb and a little shocking with 100s of rats swarming on screen. Visually, the game is very unique.\n\nThe game doesn't have a proper vsync option without a capped framerate at 60fps. This is a little backwards with modern monitors. I had to play the entire game with screen tearing.\n\nThe late game combat is a bit janky, with too much going on for the mechanics to support the fights. A lot of the fights were just die, rez, repeat until RNG helped me. A bit frustrating\n\nStill, the relationships in the story will stick with me. Especially the heroine and her brother. Amecia is an amazing character and her journey to save her brother is one you shouldn't miss.",Recommended
"TL;DR\nIt looks good, it sounds good, it feels good. Get it, if you like story-driven games. If you are more like action fan, still get it, but maybe on sale.\n\nPros:\n+ Story - dark, mysteriuos, full of emotions, I couldn't wait to see it to the end, while at the same time I didn't want it to end anytime soon\n+ Graphics - good job here\n+ Music&Sound - Feast for the ears! Fits perfectly the story and builds atmosphere. Very good voice acting feat. one of the best ""badass"" voices I've ever heard \n+ Gameplay - sneaking and thinking required. Your character will never be a half-god hero, able to take an army with one split, so you have use more discreet approach\n\nCons:\nNot sure, really... maybe one:\n- Replay value - no changing the world with choices, no diffrent ways to go forward. Still, I will certainly play again, just without  ""what if this time..."" effect",Recommended
"story rich game, did not disappoint.",Recommended
"This is a fun, linear stealth game with a decent story. The combat and the little puzzles you have to do are fun, and the characters are somewhat interesting. The replayability is, of course, low, being such a linear game and the story is revealed after the first play-through. Either way, the game is pretty good, and at the price point, it's well worth it. I'll give it a 6.5/10.",Recommended
a story driven gameplay which I enjoyed and the stealth gameplay are good despite being a linear walkthrough. you can see how Amicia develop her emotion toward Hugo and the plague in every mission,Recommended
About 10-11 hours of play time is what it took me. I did spend small amounts of time looking for collectables  but I was not overly concerned with them.  This game is fun but not difficult. The closest thing I can relate it to is the last of us. The biggest difference is you are not overly worried about supplies in this game so using types of ammo all willy nilly is no big deal and that is the only thing i would change to add more pressure. As the game continues you can make go all sneaky or just out right kill everyone. What ever floats your boat. If you purchase this game I would say its 90% for the stories as there isnt a real challenge in here as far as combat or puzzles or supply rationing. Would buy again.,Recommended
"Let me just start by saying what a game it was ! Wow just wow ! The story is very sad and emotional. Some people will disliked it but i loved it. And boy the soundtrack was so good it corresponded with the game making you feel what the characters feel. Its short, its about 12 hours but you will want to play it again. Thanks for the devs for making this ! Worth every penny.\n\n",Recommended

"TL;DR get the game. its good. \n\nThis is a beautiful game, truly a masterpiece and for me personally, it's up there at the top with The last of us and the new God of war.\nI played it during my vacation and for that reason, I played it while being drunk... about 99% of the time. \nSo I got around 14 hours of story from it.\nwhich I think is decent for a modern singleplayer game, even though I had about 5 litres of beer ingested everytime i started this game.\n\nI didn't get all the flowers.. that bothers me.. Amicia looked good with flowers in her hair.. \n\nGraphically it is really beautiful,.. lighting and sounds are perfect\nNever experienced a single bug in the game.\nlipsynch is a bit wonky at times but you wont be bothered by it. play the game and you'll understand\nmusic is also superb\n\nThat being said..\n\nIt wasn't until after I completed the game I realized that this game was developed by a french studio. It didn't dawn on me that the game is also about a french family either (even though they clearly have french names) until you see a very famous french landmark (because.. drunk..) .. therefore. If you want the full experience.. play the game with french audio. these things are to me kind of important, for the same reason you don't want the germans or russians to speak english in a WW2 movie or vice versa. realism.. or something.. I will play this game again.. sober... and with french audio.\n\nThe game is kind of linear, you don't have the option to explore or backtrack much other than a few sidetracks on every level or to the last checkpoint. The DLC is kind of cool, but pointless really, you get to choose different colours on Amicias and Hugos clothes.. thats it. But it's kind of cool to choose your coat of arms yourself before you begin the game \n\n\nI really recommend this game, I think it is really worth a playthrough even at full price.\n\ndon't drink and game... or do.. its really fun..\n(but only if you are of legal age)",Recommended
"This is a game I am EXCITED to review. Above all else, this game is something you will not regret buying and experiencing the story. The story in this game is absolutely amazing, you are completely apart of the story and the characters 100% of the way. From the start where you are terrified of the Inquisition and RATS. You progress through the game, you have your first kills and with them you feel the aftershocks of killing someone. The more you progress the more confident you are in your ability like Hugo and Amicia and it becomes easier. \nThe voice acting for me is second to the story, the whole story revolves around the children, and their actors have done a perfect job portraying these innocent, and strong children. Rodrick, Lucas, Millie and Arthur, not even to mention Hugo and Amicias relationship is just pure joy experiencing how they all interact, meet, and conclude. (Only downside of the characters was Arthurs and Millies endings, I think they could have been expanded on more). Rodrick THO Recommended gentleman.\nThe music is brilliant, it knows when to get you excited for whats ahead, or absolutely shitting you with those strings and being swarmed by rats. The graphics are absolutely amazing to top it off, so many beautiful scenes in every chapter.\nThe level design in itself is astoundingly complex, you will never do the same thing twice, the levels even though you go back to the same areas, you experience the levels differently, always heart racing and stocked up with supplies and ammo.\n\nThis game has so many amazing aspects, dont even wait for this game on sale, buy it full price, its worth it.",Recommended
"Great characters, engaging plot, and a refreshing take on the stealth/puzzle genre. It is not a incredibly difficult game by any stretch, though there are some parts here and there that can provide some frustration I do wish the game increased the difficulty more as you progress. A Plague Tale does a good job of balancing crafting and resource management without it feeling to forced or necessary but it is ultimately a story driven, character based game with great graphics and voice acting. What it does, it does well and I hope to see more games like it in the future.",Recommended

"Great game. I love atmospheric story games, and this is definitely one of those\n\n+ awesome music\n+ great visuals, very beautiful\n\ngameplay is fairly straightforward, there are options on how you complete levels (like go full out killing everyone or trying to use stealth instead). I opted for the Stealth route, i found it more challenging and interesting. \n\nThe story itself was very interesting to me, I was eager to see it wrap up and find out the answers to the questions earlier chapters had established. \n\nThere are some puzzles, most are fairly minor. It can get annoying at times if you just can't figure out what you're supposed to do, as there isn't much to go off of in solving them.

"An easy 8/10 for me.\n\nA linear stealth game with a great story, visuals, atmosphere and a fitting soundtrack.\nSadly, the gameplay is lacking and offers little depth, resulting in an overall easy game that gets even easier once you unlock more abilities.

"I was sceptical about playing through a story as two children, but I'm glad I did - it was surprisingly gripping and I didn't at all feel odd with child protagonists. Very well voice-acted, impressive graphics, a good story and good (3rd person) game play. \nIf you're not good with rats - normal rats, white rats and black rats with daemon eyes, and blood and gore, then don't get this game - there's no way to turn down the rat population or blood and guts content of this game! But if you're okay with it, then go ahead and buy it.\nIs worth mentioning the only time I got out my console (Afterglow Playstation-style one) out, was for the final Boss fight, where I had trouble adjusting the camera view using keyboard controls/mouse.

"[table]\n[tr]\n[th][b][i]Byte sized review[/i][/b][/th]\n[th]The Rats of Us[/th]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n[td][b][i]Graphics[/i][/b][/td]\n[td] [b]5/5[/b] - For an AA game from that wonderful publisher of story-rich AA games , Focus Home Entertainment (if I was a believer I would thank god for them), [b][i]A Plague Tale: Innocence[/i][/b] certainly boasts AAA quality graphics. This is the most beautiful looking game I have played all year and I am pretty much astounded that the environments and characters look as good as they do here. Asobo Studios really builds on the success of Ninja Theory's [b][i]Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice[/i][/b], showing us that mid-tier games don't have to look sub-par to their triple-A counterparts.[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n[td][b][i]Performance / Bug & Issues[/i][/b][/td]\n[td] [b]4/5[/b] - For the duration of my playtime I only ever encountered one bug early on in the game which forced me to have to restart the chapter. Sadly this happened at the end of the chapter, and it was a particularly lengthy chapter, and having to play through it again was a bit of a bummer (as not even save games would help rectify the issue) but after that little hiccup, there were no more issues. I am sure by now the issue has been patched out. Performance wise the game ran really well on my system and should run well on most medium speced machines provided you have a good CPU to back it up as I did find the game to be very CPU intensive.[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n[td][b][i]Story[/i][/b][/td]\n[td] [b]9/10[/b] - If you enjoy story-driven adventures this will be your bread and butter for the duration of your playthrough. Anchoring two children as your guides through the horrors of the Black Plague during the thirteenth century France, [b][i]A Plague Tale: Innocence[/i][/b] really excels at what it sets out to do and that is to ensure that you become as emotionally invested as quickly as possible. Tender, often heartbreaking and horrifying in equal measure, I won't be one bit surprised to see the game up for awards in the ""Best Narrative"" category when the year end nominations roll out. It also turns out to be incredibly well written. Asobo has hired a talented writer or bunch of writers and should hold on to them at all costs.[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n[td][b][i]Gameplay[/i][/b][/td]\n[td] [b]19/20[/b] - [b][I]A Plague Tale: Innocence[/i][/b] consists mostly of stealth gameplay - think of a more simplified and streamlined [b][i]Thief[/i][/b] or [b][i]Dishonored[/i][/b] -  with some light puzzles with the occasional combat (mostly with the games bosses which are more puzzles themselves than actual combat scenarios). Most of the puzzles come in the form of environmental puzzles as you use your environment to try and outwit the other stars of the show here, the rats (literally thousands of them), and figuring out how to navigate through zones heavily under siege from these pests is great fun and oh-so satisfying.[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n[td][b][i]Sound / Voice / Music[/i][/b][/td]\n[td] [b]5/5[/b] - The voice-overs for each character here are spot on. Being English speaking, I loved the slight French lilts in the actress who plays Amicia. The actress who plays Amicia uses a lot emotion in her voice and I quickly fell in love with here wishing I had had the oppertunity to have a big sister like her. I often wanted to stop and hug poor little Hugo, so endearing was the voice actor who brought this little tyke to life. In other areas the game really excels with one of the most beautiful orchestral soundtracks I have heard all year. It is a complete treat for the ears. [/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n[td][b][i]Replay value[/i][/b][/td]\n[td] [b]3/5[/b] - Unfortunately being story-driven there will be very little replay value to those who value this sort of quality in a game. As far as I am aware there aren't any choice-based options or narrative branches that break the story off with different outcomes. Each person who plays the game will pretty much get the same experience as the next. For me personally, I love returning to good single player games, and I can easily see myself returning to play this one again in a few years time just to reunite myself with the wonderfully realised characters created for this game.[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n[td][b][i]Fun Factor[/i][/b][/td]\n[td] [b]9/10[/b] - I had a wonderful time playing [b][i]A Plague Time: Innocence[/i][/b]. I found it to be very well paced, incredibly well written, filled with engaging gameplay and puzzles and the perfect length for a person like me who has a busy work and personal life. As an adventure filled with humor, pathos and outright horror this won't be a game I will easily forget and is definitely the one of the highlights of my gaming year thus far. [b][i]A Plague Tale: Innocence[/i][/b] is 2019's sleeper hit. Whatever you do, don't sleep on this adventure. Pick it up today and show your support to studios who still value the single player experience. If you are someone who values single player story driven games then this is an essential pickup and definitely a contender for GOTY awards come the year end. Also + 1 for including a photo mode, more games really should include this feature as a standard.[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n[td][b][i]Overall score[/i][/b][/td]\n[td][b]90%[/b][/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n[td][b][i]Rating[/i][/b][/td]\n[td]https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=869453048[/td]\n[/tr]\n[/table]",Recommended
"An rather linear experience that oozes atmosphere. France in the Late Middle Ages was dirty, dark and merciless, wars were common, fought on the backs of the common folk. The game shows this and for that purpose doesn't shy away from depicting drastic and explicit images while at the same time creating scenes of great beauty. While the name-giving plague (transmitted by rats) is fictitious, it's clearly inspired by the real Black Plague or better how the common folk must have seen this plague.\nWhile the gameplay especially in the later stages of the game (primarily the last chapters & the finale) leave some things to be desired (e.g. mechanics are introduced, utilized for one or two scenes and immediately forgotten afterwards), the overall experience is one I can wholeheartedly recommend.",Recommended

A Plague Tale: Innocence is truly in a league of its own.\n\nThis game has set a Recommended high bar for story rich, Action and Adventure titles coming in the near future. From the humble beginnings of Amicias' trip with her father, to constant clashes with the inquisition this game keeps you on the edge of your seat,\n\nThe Graphics are spectacular. The characters are loveable and deep with personality, the puzzles can be slightly tedious but are fun none-the-less and lastly the story is somthing to worship as it leaves you wanting more with the feeling of ""Just 5 more minutes,"" turning into ""Just one more chapter"" \n\nI'd give this game a 4/5",Recommended
Best story-rich game ive played in a long time.,Recommended
"A Plague Tale: Innocence is one of the best story based games I’ve ever played. The game is set in France during the Black Plague in the 1340s. You play as 2 young siblings: Amicia and Hugo, who are trying to escape from the Knights of the Inquisition. All around you the world is falling apart due to the plague/Black Death and you’re being hounded by the realm’s fiercest, unrelenting knights. The story is an emotional rollercoaster filled with bloodshed, drama, stealthy escapes and a plague of ever hungry, flesh craving rats.\n\nThe gameplay is a linear based story and involves combat, stealth, exploration and crafting to survive. It’s well polished and has no bugs (that I’ve experienced anyway); something which very few games, let alone AAA games can claim in 2019. The game has a great story, an excellent soundtrack which really helps create the ambience of the world, beautiful graphics along with stunning character voice and design which help create a really bleak, dire atmosphere where you really feel like the world is ending. The game takes around 15 hours to complete and has varying difficulties and optional collectables should you be interested in playing through a second time.",Recommended

""Candidate"" in a sense that it's good but you rather buy it in a discounted price than full.",Recommended

"The soundtrack, characters, and voice acting are all quite amazingly done in this game.  The visuals, especially for the character models themselves are quite good.  The story is gripping and like an enthralling book you just want to you keep going to see where it goes next.  The story itself is roughly just over 10 hours, but there are collectibles you find within each chapter so for completionists that will add some hours more.  My only complaint is the combat gameplay and stealth mechanics are quite mediocre.  The story IMO more than makes up for that.  Overall I would give it a 4/5.",Recommended
"I finished A Plague Tales: Innocence and it was fantastic game! The story was so good tho sometimes kind of wonky for my taste. The characters were immediately likable and sooo good written! :blue_heart: The game mechanics were very interesting and you could take many paths how to get thru the area (sneak vs. fight), this got a bit harder further into the game (I started dying A LOT and got frustrated). And the music, Shadow, the music was as all what Olivier Deriviere made out of this world! The transition from 'peaceful' to 'fight' and back in just few seconds is something he absolutely can do WELL! And it's filled with emotion as the game itself. I 100% recommend to play it if you can!",Recommended
"A Plagues Tale in a nutshell: ""Hugo! Hugo! Hugo!"" - ""Amicia!"". Magic slingshot, magic rats, the end.\n\nGameplay.\nRemember every quest in every game where you have to accompany a NPC? The one that walks slower than you? Welp, thats basically the game. Walking, strolling, crouching, running, slow-walking, sneaking, forced ultra-slow-walking, torch-walking, you choose. Interrupted by casual quick-time events where you may use the auto-focus slingshot to one-hit every enemy. The idea of a two-character play is nice, but not very well crafted. Little Hugos purpose resembles the smol characters of the Lego Game franchise, where the smol character is only needed to climb through smol doors. \n\nStory.\nExpecting some plague-related story in A Plagues Tale, I was kinda confused to discover it’s more a “Magic tale” than a plagues tale. The plague has no influence whatsoever to the story, no character is affected by plague or loosing dear ones to the plague. (My guess: the plague is an excuse to fill the backgrounds with dead bodies to get a that grim-dark scar-feel). Even if I tried to get into the non-plague-related magic blood story, i find it hard to feel any excitement about the next story about Chosen Ones learning about their magical powers combined with extra sparkles of revenge, dipped in Mother/brother-issues. Also the very two-dimensional “kill 1 main villain and the whole world will live in harmony forever and ever, even the trees will be green again” is not very satisfying. That’s Disney-territory. Maybe I’m just not the target group. Still mad about the lost chance to experience an actual tale about the plague.\n\nCharacters.\nInstead of strong characters with rich backstory you get cliché-salad: Whiny little kids getting ""strong and independet"" over night while discovering friendship/brotherhood was the treasure all along the way.\nI‘m especially disappointed by the baddies. They could have been real love-to-hate characters, struggling with greed and creed, maybe wishing to heal the plague and taking casualties for that goal. They had the whole Imperator-Vader-vibe and i truly hoped to see Lord Nicholas going through some character arc, struggling with his loyalty to the pope-imperator by connecting with the children (or the mother?) or something like that. Or at least give him a tragic backstory which lead to his loyalty and goals. Buuuuut...they are evil just for evils sake, no further explanation. Never mind Amicia killing hundreds of guards, it’s the church-dudes who are evil because..world domination, eternal life! You know, they are milking blood of the innocents every now and then to make sure, you, the player don’t forget who is the real enemy while commanding rats to eat all the guards.\n\nWorld.\nExited to explore a rich mediaval world i entered the game to find noice muddy backgrounds for my one-way-adventure.

"One of the greatest narrative-driven games out on steam. Asobo went all out on A Plague Tale- everything from the articulate and mood-enhancing soundtrack, the detailed visuals, EXTREMELY talented voice actors of the characters, and a plot which will draw you in entirely, with just enough vagueness to leave you wanting more.\n\nGameplay-wise, A Plague Tale is of a slower pace, with stealth segments and puzzles often requiring a slower, methodical playstyle. Of course, there are also numerous chase and combat sequences encountered, especially later on in the game. The Rat Swarm mechanics are very unique and offer a fresh, unsettling perspective when navigating levels. Expect yourself to be juggling the safety of light and shadow- one will hide you from the rats, and the other from guards. And when both are in your way, it makes for an experience challenging enough to keep you engaged.\n\nWatching a Walkthrough, I personally discourage, even if you are only interested in the story. After all, the delivery is brilliant and best experienced by yourself. While the game itself is short- it took me around twelve hour to complete, it is a short but sweet game which will leave you wanting more.",Recommended
"Very sweet characters with alot of heartwarming moments. A brutal yet very well made story about a sister and her little brother bonding in dire times indeed!\nIf you want a game that focus on the story and characterbuilding, this is your game. Best of luck to Asobo, games like these are so very rare in a industry hellbent on liveservices and open worlds...",Recommended

"I loved this game. I played it over the course of 3 or 4 days and truly enjoyed every aspect. The story is grappling, the gameplay at first depends on sneaking but eventually progresses to your choice of killing or passive. I bought this on the steam summer sale and it was a gem. I would not spend $45 on this, mainly because you only get so many hours out of the game unless you go back to collect collectibles. However, if it were on sale for cheaper than 25, I would recommend buying.\n\nIt's a very linear story-driven game.",Recommended

Main characters and side characters are all unique and they all have interesting stories. The story length is adequate and you wont feel like you are getting bored later on with the game. Took me around 2 days to finish the whole game. The combat and gaming is smooth and interesting. You can have multiple ways of solving the puzzle of each chapter. Definitely a 9/10 review from the game\n\nThe only advice that i would give to the game is the rats...sometimes you already pass by them and under a light source but still you get killed :( so ...,Recommended

Its a beautiful game that focuses mostly on story and puzzles. The graphics are fantastic and story is intriguing. It takes around 15 hours to complete The combat is pretty simple so i would recommend playing on higher difficulties for sure. This game retails for under 60 dollars but it still feels like a full game. . I think its mostly due to the fact that the game is very linear and there's not much as far as mechanics go. I recommend getting this game to anyone who likes a story.,Recommended

Their VA, every dialogue,  both impressive choices of music and stunning graphics creating an atmosphere that suits what I was, or we all should be expecting, even went beyond.

"Not the worst game, but get it when it's seriously on sale, because currently it's overpriced like hell.  \n\nI spent more than 16 hours completing the game and the characters are poorly defined, with the villains also hilariously one-note as well.  The overall story also isn't that great either.  Emotionally, Amicia and Hugo are pretty much the same people at the start of the game that they are at the end, having apparently learned nothing major or gone through any major epiphanies through all their struggles except that they should stick together.  Also their VAs in English are terrible.  Switch to one of the foreign languages.\n\nCrafting is all over the place but there's typically only one way of progressing when dealing with anything more than one or two guards at a time and you'll find a mountain of crafting gear to show you what the actual solution is meant to be.  It feels less like something that needed to be in the game and rather something that got included because All Those Other Games did it.\n\nThe game is also extremely linear.  Aside from a handful of more open-ended environments, there's typically only one way forward.  Going off the beaten path might get you some more goodies but there's not much else to the game.  Many sequences feel like they could've been a lot shorter too, or made to be more engaging.  I would've liked a more laid-back approach to the game, with more emphasis on using only the sling and environmental hazards to fight more enemies.  The kind of rush I got from taking out armored knights charging at me when I have a kid with psychic control over rats for barely-explained reasons takes the feeling of being an underdog out of the equation.\n\nThen we get to the rats.  Much ado can be made about the rats and the graphical engine featuring them, essentially as a more lively lava floor.  And it's really jank too.  The rats'll take an eternity eating some things (read, they'll be there forever), other times it takes just a few seconds for them.  It feels very much like the devs didn't put as much thought into their systems as they thought.\n\nAnd lastly, as mentioned before, the game has ""Innocence"" in its title and by the end of it both Amicia and Hugo have murdered a LOT of people, but at the same time, I feel like not enough time or energy or writing were put into really exploring that.  It would've felt a lot heavier if Amicia wouldn't have been able to kill people with her sling until much later into the game, and doing so marked a significant turning point in the narrative.  But ultimately ""Innocence"" can't qualify as a theme in the story, and as a result you barely have a story at all.",Not Recommended

"A very OK game, but nothing more. I did enjoy the atmosphere, kudos for spending special attention to environments, they are just exceptional. The whole idea of stealth mechanics was intriguing. Especially when you start encountering rats (which btw have been designed amazingly!). \n\nBut that's all praise I got. I am a big fan of linear structures in the game, but ""A Plague Tale"" literally is very basic. There is only one way to go and only with one way of completion. Story is simplistic and inorganic. It all starts nice and cool, but once it gets to second act, that's when you realize all the shortcomings of writing. Character arcs, evolution and motivations are weird. Worst offender - game controls. It feels like this game was made for Atari joystick with only directions and two buttons to push. Gameplay is very repetitive, simplistic and eventually boring. Puzzles are easy, NPC's are predictable, boss levels are joke.\n\nOverall: 5/10",Not Recommended
"This game is so so so so freakin great like you cannot believe, it just put me in another world right off the bat and wouldn't let go. My first time playing it I played it for 7 hours straight I was so into it and I only stopped because it was 1am and I had to go to work at 4am LOL!  First off the graphics are unbelievable, and my computer isn't that great, using a Nvidia GTX 970 I was able to play this with the graphics on the ultra setting with an amazing frame rate, the programming is probably the best I've ever seen in any high end graphics game, I couldn't believe how fast it loaded or if you wanted to change the graphics settings how fast it did it. Compare that to something like Kingdom come deliverance which takes forever. And the story is amazing and very moving and just when you think you are nearing the end of the game, it goes on and on and on. The sound and music is top notch, what I find with a lot of other games is after a while the music gets repetitive so I shut it off. Not so with this, the music in this and when it is played is absolutely perfect. I'm a video game addict, just ask the people at steam LOL. No joke i must have over 100 games in my library and this is without question in my top 3 all time greatest games. Put it this way: I've never written a review on a video game in my life until this it so impressed me. Another thing I love about this game is it has a photo feature where at any time you can pause it and take screen shots at any angle, you can move the camera up or down forwards, backwards which makes amazing wallpaper for my PC, the graphics are that good. 10 out of 10 stars!",Recommended

"This is not really a ""story rich game"". It is an interactive story. The difference between the two is that an interactive story needs a specific input in order to progress the story forward, and nothing else from the user. This ""game"" is just like a slideshow where you click on the slide to go to the next one, except with a hugely complexified ""mouse click"" trigger.\n\nLet me explain: you don't use your brains. You don't use reflexes. You don't level up abilities ""the right way"" to be able to beat the game in one of multiple ways. Or any given sequence. There is ONE very specific THING to do with each sequence. You do it, the story moves forward. You do something else, no moving forward.\n\nStory is great, \nGraphics are great,\nSound is excellent,\nVoice acting is beautiful,\nGameplay is nonexistent.\n\nThis horror represents everything that is wrong with gaming today.

But many of the rooms are structured in such a way that even if there are multiple ways to get past an enemy, the choice is really either ""throw rock at pile of armor to distract guard"" or kill the guard. and there isn't really any tradeoff to either except time. But if that's fine with you you'll love it.\n\nThe story is a bit juvenile, but I guess they're kids. What's with making all video games from the perspective of kids?",Recommended

"To be honest I can not understand these overwelmingly positive reviews.\nDon't get me wrong, the game is not terrible by any means, but I was still very dispointed with the game.\n\nFirst let me start out with the positives.\nThe atmosphere of the game is great. The dark and dirty world feels as depressing, as it should, considering the setting of the story.\nIt knows when to up the action, when to go for a more creepy approach and when to slow things down to give the player some time to breathe.\nAlso the soundtrack is great in my oppinion. It really helps to absorb you into the world.\n\nThe Story is okay, it doens't really feel very innovative and groundbreaking, but it fulfills its purpose and has some strong moments.\n\nThe gameplay is where A Plague Tale: Innocence really drops the ball though. \nThe AI is most of the times very dumb, so there is never really a chellenge. To this also comes that there is never not a very obvios solution to any problem. \nAlso there is always just one way to progress. You run, walk or sneak through one tunnel after the other and even when you have the choice betwenn several paths, it either makes absolutely no difference or one simply just leads to a collectible and you have to go back to the one right path anyways.\nA lot of times the controls feel very clunky and not as pricise as they should, which makes some parts just very annoying. \nAnd thats how I would describe most of the actual gameplay: Annoying.\nThe actual gameplay parts almost always felt like a chore just to push the story forward.\n\nOverall I would say that A Plague Tale: Innocence is a decent game at best.\nIf you like story and atmosphere driven games, maybe buy it when its on sale again.\nTo eveyone that values diverse, challenging or enjoyable gameplay I would not recommend this game.",Not Recommended

"I don't write many reviews, but this game is interesting.\n\nI did really enjoy it, like many other detailed historical games I've played.   The rats are cool, and its fun to have your enemies devoured by them, much as it was in the Dishonored series....it was always my favorite weapon.\n\nThe story is pretty compelling if a bit thin, and you get that medieval feeling during both the story and experiencing the visuals.  The voice acting is really terrific and convincing, and the soundtrack is excellent.   When entering the castle, the artwork is fantastic, as are the puzzles.\n\nAll in all, a nice and original game.\n\nNow the less than stellar.\n\nThe gameplay is solid, but very unique.  And with that unique gameplay, comes the incredibly frustrating characteristic of having to repeat the same thing over and over and over and over again.  As with most games with autosave, the designers have a choice as to how long the autosave interval is.   In Plague Tale, sometimes the interval is simply painful.\n\nSomething as simple as a quicksave slot or 2 would do wonders for the gameplay so you can figure out which way is best to proceed.  Sometimes, you literally have zero idea what to do, which I usually really like.  Which really highlights the frustration, which led me to simply shut off the game and go do something else with my time.\n\nTo make matters more frustrating, are the often sluggish controls for certain functions, like rat control, or walking with someone else attached to you, which is super slow and grueling.  Aiming is goofy with certain things, and combine that with sluggish or inaccurate controls makes several passages in the game truly infuriating.\n\nAll in all, this is a nice story driven medieval game that I mostly enjoyed.   But the constant replaying the same exact sequence 30 times grows old.",Recommended
"One of the best games of it's kind on PC. It has an exciting and emotional storyline with great characters and impressive graphics. The setting and the overall atmosphere is just amazing.\n\nThe gameplay is mostly based on stealth, but later you can also fight enemys when you get more techniques to defeat them. Sometimes the game gives you no choice, and by that I mean that stealth is required in a lot of parts, while in others you can or even must defeat your enemys. \nAnother big element are the rats which I thought could be kind of annoying, but I got proven wrong as the mechanics are actually a lot of fun and you also get different ways to deal with the swarms while you progress through the game.\n\nThe devs at Asobo created a very polished quality game which makes me hope that they will do more of this kind. We really need more games like this on PC. This is the closest to ""The Last of Us"" you can get on PC!\n\nI didn't even have this game on my radar when it came out, I just bought it in the recent steam summer sale.

"A Plague Tale: Innocence - One of the Best Games I Have Played In A While\n\n    A Plague Tale: Innocence is a stealth, adventure game that was released on May 15, 2019. To be quite honest, I had no idea this game existed until it was already released. At first glance, I somewhat passed it off and ignored it, however, I then began to see reviews roll in. A lot of praise was being thrown its way, and this piqued my interest. Then I saw the game on sale during the Steam Summer Sale and decided to buy it out of genuine interest. That was when my love for this game was about to start.\n\n    The story of the game intrigued me from the start. It is set in France during 1349, which is one of the years when the Bubonic, or Black, Plague was ridden across Europe. Coincidence? I think not. The game has you take the rule of Amicia de Rune, a 15 year old girl with a bit of a troubled and sad childhood. She barely sees her father, and rarely sees her mother who is busy taking care of her brother, Hugo, who has a very special condition. At the start of the game, her and Hugo are practically strangers. At the beginning of the game, she asks her father to play the “knight game” with her which involves her using her sling to hit the apples hanging off a tree to become “knighted.” Her father questions this saying that she isn’t a kid anymore, but I think that there is something more deep rooted with this. She is trying to relive her childhood memories, back when she actually saw her parents, maybe as an escape from her lonely home life. The game continues with you chasing your dog, Lion, through the woods. The woods at the start are very lush and colorful, filled with lots of brush and bushes. As you get deeper into the forest, however, the environment becomes much more dreary. Large rocks, dead trees, lots of mud on the ground, it is a complete 180 from the past scenery. Something horrific occurs which leads to you and your father leaving the woods and heading back to their home. When you arrive, you are tasked with telling your mother what happened. As you are telling her, commotion can be heard from outside. Your mother tells you to watch over Hugo as she investigates. There’s some small chit-chat between Amicia and Hugo, which further shows just how much they don’t know each other. He barely knows who she is a first and she has to remind him. Guards from the so-called Inquisition burst into the house, looking for Hugo. Using stealth you sneak out a regroup with your mother. The three of you sneak out of your home village, however your mother is forced to stay behind. Amicia and Hugo rush through the dreary forest, the Inquisition hot on their tails, and they leap into a river. And A Plague Tale: Innocence has fully begun. \n\n    The game hits you hard at the beginning, and it never really lets up. The game is a third-person game, and a stealth one too. It is also really smart about it’s stealth mechanics. Due to the fact that you are a 15 year old girl, you can’t really just rush up to an enemy guard and strangle them until they’re unconscious or dead, you have to maneuver around them, sometimes avoiding confrontation at all. As your companion, you can tell Hugo whether to stay close to you, in which case he holds your hand, or to stay where he his. If he is alone too long, however, he begins to panic and alert guards. You are also equipped with a sling which you can use to hurl rocks. At the beginning you use it to distract enemies by hitting metal and such, however, eventually, you are driven to use it on enemies, hitting them in the head and killing them. You get other projectiles too, ones that can be crafted for certain gameplay mechanics. Igniting and extinguishing fires, forcing enemies to take their helmets off, attracting rats to a certain area. You must use these tools to navigate through, because, if you alert the guards, chances are they will outnumber you and you can take out one or two but then they’ll kill you, so a pure confrontation is not recommended. Due to this, the tension of the game is much more high, as you know that getting spotted can almost mean certain death. You gather items through the world that will help you craft these different projectiles too, and you can also use them to upgrade Amicia’s sling, pouches, etc. Then there’s the rats, which are the second type of enemy in this game. If they swarm you, you die, so you have to be smart about navigating them. They’re afraid of fire, so torches and flame projectiles are key when faced with them, and you’ll be faced with them a lot.\n\n    The graphics of this game are breathtaking to say the least. The environments can be so beautiful one minute and then incredibly bone-chilling the next, they did an excellent job at making these environments memorable, detailed, and interesting. There is so much detail in everything, from rocks and pieces of wood, to Amicia’s or Hugo’s hair and clothing. It all looks very picturesque. The amount of rats they could fit onto the screen at once was incredible, there had to be thousands of them. They aren’t the most detailed, however it’s still awesome to witness. The audio of the game is great, with fantastic audio cues for when an enemy is distracted. The voice acting of the game is great, everyone seems to have a French accent, which would make sense since they’re in France. \n\n    The game had a very big lasting impact on me. The themes of the game were really interesting. Themes such as jealousy, loneliness, loss of innocence, loss, strength. The amount of things these children have to experience is disturbing. When Amicia first kills someone, she feels genuine regret, however, towards the end of the game, she will do anything to save her brother. She survives by the strength of her will, and knows that she cannot stop when there are people depending on her. The game also frequently reminds you, through the dialog, that she is still a kid, which makes the game even more chilling. Her brother’s condition worsens as you get through the game. I won’t spoil what the condition is, however, it does play a very integral part in the plot and, eventually, the gameplay of the later sections of the game. The characters stuck with me and I liked all of them, except for the bad guys haha. The gameplay felt natural and didn’t feel clunky to me at all despite what I’ve heard some reviews say. The graphics immersed me, and the environments told a story. I was absorbed into this game from start to end. It ended up taking me around 8 hours to finish, however, I do not regret, for a second, my 8 hours with the game. This game is a hidden gem that does things different and was enjoyable all the way through. In the sea of game releases, especially the first half of the year, this one stands out, and it is one of the best games I have ever played.\n\nA Plague Tale: Innocence is a heartbreaking story about loss and family. Loss of family, loss of innocence, the bond of family, these themes are all beautifully weaved into a compelling narrative of two children forced into survival against the odds. It is a tremendous experience.",Recommended
"Fantastic game with a compelling storyline. \n\nIt's not especially difficult, but it was a fun game that easily made the hours fly by.",Recommended
I did not expect to enjoy this game as much as I did. I liked the story and the game play was fun. The puzzles were fun and you could really tackle most situations however you want. Honestly the only thing I didnt like was the very last boss fight. It was slightly annoying. Besides that though pretty fun time.,Recommended
"Loved the story to this game. If you are looking to escape the chaos of a game with online matchmaking and want to delve into a story with characters you actually care about, check this game out. Great graphics as well.",Recommended

"Just incredible. I love story-driven games, and this one hit all the right buttons for me - for once, the hype is real! Support good game writing, buy this game.\n\nA Plague Tale: Innocence puts the player in the position of a young girl and younger brother fleeing murderous inquisition soldiers and mysteriously organized and vicious rats. I love how the game plays with the concept of innocence by throwing these children into gruesome and extremely risky/demanding situations and urging you to look at the situation through their eyes, through a lens of innocence, at the same time. The character building is just great, so you end up really feeling both characters wrestling with what they experience. The psychological adventure of playing a stealth combat role as a couple of children running for their lives was totally unique and really compelling.\n\nMore than once I fell into the trap of thinking the story was predictable and coming to a dissatisfying close, and every time I was happily surprised to be wrong. The game kept stretching on in new and interesting ways. There isn't a lot of depth to the gameplay, but it does change enough to complement the growing drama of the story. I found the puzzles sometimes irritating, but just irritating enough? It was just the right amount of resistance to make it a game and not a virtual novel. I never got stuck anywhere long enough to get really annoyed with the game. It does get stupidly easy at points, but those are pretty brief moments that don't leave a lasting impression. \n\nI suppose that's the one drawback - if you're looking for challenging, fast-paced gameplay, a lot of exciting combat scenes, that kind of thing, well this is not that game. This is the game where you throw yourself into another world for awhile and become invested in the characters until you can't help but keep turning the pages, in a manner of speaking. I love narrative heavy games and really wish there were tons more that are this well done. Even though it's a completely linear game I can definitely see myself getting at least another replay out of this one.\n\n10/10 would murder the high inquisitor with rat magic again.",Recommended
"Truly a marvelous game.\nIt has a strong emphasis on the story while the actual gameplay isn't too hard. Therefore if you're looking for a hard challenge, you'll have to look elsewhere but if you want to enjoy a good story with nice twists, you'll definitely have to give this game a shot! \n(Also look at the user ratings! This game really is nice)\nAlso kudos to the devs to deliver believable brother-sister relation with arguments etc.\n\nThe negative points are minor clipping errors, if you're standing close to walls/corners and the protagonists faces clip into the walls but usually you'll hardly notice that. Also the game sometimes felt choppy which probably might have been caused by stream-loading during each level. Otherwise it ran like a charm.\n\nI'd buy this game at full price, again if I had to. Worth every penny IMHO :)",Recommended

Loved it!,Recommended
"Such an amazing game with such an amazing story. I found it hard to put my controller down for work or sleep. Both Amicia and Hugo are amazing characters, and their voice actors have such an incredible talent. One of my favorite lines from the story, actually, is [spoiler]when Amicia exclaims, during her nightmare, that everything she did was for Hugo, saying, “I did it for him! And I’ll kill you again if I have to! I’LL KILL ALL OF YOU!”[/spoiler] That, to me, shows just how determined she was to make it through the journey and to protect her little brother at any cost. If they ever make a sequel, I hope they keep Amicia's original voice actress because she did such a fantastic job. The graphics were incredible, the way the rats would try to crawl up to you was extremely surreal, and the slingshot, dear god, the slingshot. I don't think I've ever played a game where a slingshot has been this deadly. I'm definitely going to play this game back again, but I really wish that I could experience it for the first time again. It had such a nice feel to it, and I seriously need more games like this.",Recommended
"First of all i would like to tell what this game don't have: No multiplayer. No cut content. No lootboxes. No microtransactions. \nJust a game like it should be.\n\n[h1]GRAPHICS[/h1]\nThe game looks very impressive. There is right balance between light and dark. Environment and nature done very well. Some location done so good that it's easy to forget about game itself. Buildings, clothing, armor and furniture recreated very faithful to middle age.\nAlso i would like to mention pretty weather effects like snow and mist.  Main characters looks and sounds according their age. However facial expression and animation during cutscenes feels little off and not that like in game itself. Also some questionable quality textures in some places. And let's forget our main guests - rats. From distance they look like organized crowd and in close you can see each individual ""character"". Very creepy and frighteningly. But overall graphical fidelity very high and on AAA level\n\n[h1]SOUNDTRACK[/h1]\nIt's really very good. it was created by old traditional instrument that easily remind me Witcher 3. Soundtracks fits very well to what happening on the screen. Tension, serenity, drama, happiness- everything have it own theme\n\n[h1]STORY[/h1]\nWell. It is obviously the strongest part of the game. You follow the girl Amicia that  try to save her brother Hugo from horrible destiny. Which is  not easy especially consider that she barely know him. I don't want to spoil anymore but in my opinion this game worth your time and money just to see their story. Huge amount of effort was put to create all this small talks and total story. Character's development is impressive and can't be ignore. It is correct not just for main characters but also for for support characters. I really enjoy story and characters.\n[h1]GAMEPLAY[/h1]\nIt's part survival, part stealth action game. Most of the game you play hide and seek with enemies, looking the way to eliminate them silently and move forward.  You can kill enemy or pass them silently depending on your skill/gear tree. There is progression system that allow to improve your equipment . Just remember that your enemies not only humans but rats. And they don't forgive mistake. Walking around them require some easy puzzle that open/clear way for you. Nothing blowing mind but decent enough to keep you from bore. Definitely not the best part of the game but serve it purpose.\n[h1]REPLAYABILITY[/h1]\nAside collectables and some special achievement there is no replayability. Basically it's on time ride and price reflect this fact as well. So if you expect many endings or branches in story/progression system it's not here. I personally don't thinks that it's hurt this specific game. But keep this at mind\n\n[h1]PERFORMANCE[/h1]\nI use i5 9600k, GTX 1080; 16GB RAM and Windows 10. I run game on 2560x1440 resolution with max settings (scale 100%). The game runs very smooth, fps between ~80 and 100. Aside first location where amount of details is crazy. But even then fps stay above 50.\nSometimes i experience small fps drops if too many rats on the screen or during autosave. But nothing significantly that impact enjoyment.\n\n[h1]SUMMARY[/h1]\nWell. It is undeniable one of the best story driven game that i played in this year. And i would like to recommend this game to anyone who like singleplayer story driven experience. You will not regret.",Recommended

SO in a nut shell you guys SHOULD play this game its just.....wow \nit has it all..\n 1-amazing story that well leave you wondering why can't every game be like this \n 2-the best graphics and environment's from snow to sunny to dark and creepy \n 3-fun gameplay mechanics with lots of puzzles and some action here and there \nyou can approach Situations in Different ways and its all up to you to figure it out \nespecially if your into stealth games you'll find this game amazing.the intensity builds up quickly so if your into stories that leaves you saying WHAT! then this game is for you \ni recommend it 100% for all kinds of gamer's,Recommended
It is a well made game but the story is not very interesting and the game play is kind of boring,Not Recommended
"A Plague Tale, a singleplayer game with a well written story and a simple gameplay.\n\nThis game is simple enough that you don't need to read tutorial/help etc to figure things out. click play and get into it, except for there are no choices and whatever you do the outcome is the same, good in storytelling except for the events that unfolds in the 13 century England with the cities that are swallowed by the plague is not based on Recommended events, but in a way that is enough to ruin the game from real and fantasy, And in that way the storytelling is interesting but not enough that attracted my attention to the story, and thus this game is between good action and good storytelling, but still manages to give you 12 hours of good time to spend in this game. the environment is realistic, really captured my attention with how much the developers put their efforts in to make the game look stunning. overall a simple and nice singleplayer game with action with a well written story.",Recommended
"""The best game I've played this year"" – it's not a statement I would sign, but it is an immersive game set in a medieval, fantastic world. Intriguing story. At times the game may require a bit of unnecessary patience, as it will force you to walk slowly, or wait for someone to finish their speech etc.\nAfter 16 hours recorded by Steam I finished it. Unfortunately, no New Game + or something similar available. That's a downside, but generally it's a game I would recommend if you're into stealth/fantasy games.",Recommended

"In open-world games, I tend to be a completionist. They suck me in with those map icons and I want to tag them all. The main story line, if there is much of one, almost never gets completed by the time I burn out. When I do tighten my mental screws and thrust forward to finish it, I feel unsatisfied somehow. The side content is supposed to be part of it, but I just don't have the time anymore to do them both. The result of finishing it too soon leaves me with a feeling like I left the stove on by the time the credits roll. There is so much I am forgetting to do on the map!\n\nThis game is a fresh respite from that grind. It is focused and intense, and it knows what it is. Some might say this game is on rails, and you are right. You are right in the same way that you can boil any game down to its basics, decomposing the nuance that makes games actually enjoyable. You are right in the same way that turning a page in a book is on rails. You know you are going to the next page, but it can still surprise you. This game surprised me, delighted me, and even crushed me. I felt nervous when the characters were nervous, and felt angry when they were angry.\n\nThe game mechanics work with you slowly at first. I had a method about my way of meeting each challenge, but under the surface I knew there could be many others. Then, when you think you know everything about the game, tables are turned, and expectations change. As for my expectations going in, the graphics were much better than I thought they would be and probably better than they needed to be. And the sound... oh the sound. Use good speakers or headphones. The gravely string instruments coming in at just the right times, the voice acting, the environment... They brought me into the world to stay for a long while.\n\nIt took me hardly any time to finish, especially compared to those open-world games. But it was appropriate and exactly as long as it needed to be. I quit back to the desktop feeling very satisfied. No stove was left on, everything was rosy, nothing was forgotten. Well worth the money. That being said, I got it on the Summer Sale, but I would have paid full price.\n",Recommended

"Great game but it has two things that kill it for me. First, an on-rails system that has not bypass for when absolutely stuck. If you can't get past, for some reason, the game becomes dead, not enjoyable and no mater how good the story is, or how gorgeous it is, it no longer is fun. Second, related to the first, is that people who have tremors and aiming is critical, when you are on an on-rails system and can't get past something, it no longer is enjoyable.\n\nMost of the games I love are from studios like Bethesda, who makes games with multiple paths to the same goal or have some mechanism to get past something.\n\nSo if you have a hard time with on-rail games with no bypass and have a issues aiming, you might want to stay clear.\n\nAnd I can't get a refund because I used all my Steam points to buy this during the sale and it was a pretty wasteful. If I could I would and wouldn't even write a review.",Not Recommended

"Something fascinating I find about this game is that it's better the less you know before playing it. I went into this game not knowing anything, and because of that I feel that I had the utmost full experience. It is truly a masterpiece. If you’re interested in this game, but don't want any spoilers, I recommend watching at least the beginning on a youtube or twitch video to see if the story/gameplay interests you. If it does, then it is for sure worth it. If you’re still hesitant however, here is the rest of my review:\n\n     Because I don’t want to reveal any major story spoilers, the most basic summary I can provide is that you play as Amicia de Rune, a fifteen-year-old girl living in 1300s France during the Plague. She travels the country with her little brother looking for a cure for his mysterious illness while the English Inquisition hunts them down. But the Inquisition isn’t the only thing hunting them... \n\nIt is a linear story game that has elements of stealth, puzzles, and badass action. The stealth in this game is strikingly similar to the Last of Us while taking extra steps of using distractions and critical thinking strategies to outwit enemies. Amicia’s weapons include her sling that can be gradually upgraded at workbenches, and various alchemical recipes she gathers and learns how to craft with materials she finds throughout the world. As I mentioned before, this game is extremely linear, but different strategies in gameplay can allow different experiences. Want to play as a murderous serial killer? You can get extra snippets of dialogue from your party members. Want to play stealthy and invisible? You may discover new areas that you didn’t find in your first time through.  Depending on whatever strategy you choose, Amicia will mostly take out enemies from a distance, and any close-range combat will almost always end in fatality. The puzzle areas of this game aren’t difficult, but they will require some thinking that may take a few minutes to figure out. The game is separated into chapters and once a chapter has been finished, it can be replayed at any time. There are also several collectables that each have their own historical meaning and descriptions that illustrate their importance throughout the time period. \n\n     As for the story itself, it is very dark and gruesome. If you get queasy from gross things, are very sensitive to animal cruelty, or are incredibly fearful of rats, this game might not be the best for you. It gives an idea of the realities European people suffered with during the Plague along with the horrific results of war. The characters demonstrate how far they are willing to go in order to get to safety and escape dangerous places. The setting is immersive and realistic for 1300s France with the graphics enhancing ridiculously gorgeous environments. There were several times I had to pause for a second to just admire the absolute beauty that lay before me. The soundtrack is an orchestral masterpiece and one of the best I have heard in a video game. I could listen to it for hours. As soon as I hear those cellos going… damn, I know what’s coming, and the fear arises. The quieter in-between moments are also incredibly memorable and touching.\n\n     One of the big highlights of the game I have to mention is its pacing in both story and gameplay. Amicia will learn gradually, not only with survival skills, but with her mindset as well. She starts off being completely stressed and fearful when it comes to her enemies, but will eventually learn how to confidently deal with and manipulate them to her advantage. I personally felt myself grow alongside the character as we both learned how to approach the next situation.\n\n     Despite my overwhelming positivity, I do have a couple of critiques. The first one being the game’s price. It is currently $44.99 and for an 8-10 hour game, that does create a bit of skepticism as to whether it is worth it. In my personal opinion, although this game is an amazing work of art, the price is a bit high. If you are not completely invested in this game (like I am) or love it to pieces (like I do), I could understand if someone could feel cheated after paying all that money. I would ultimately recommend getting it while it’s on sale if you’re not willing to pay the full price, as it’s just too damn good to completely skip out on.  My other critique involves the characters. While the game does provide a wonderful cast of characters each with their own personalities and goals, I feel that there could have been more content directed towards them. The bonds you create with the party members are done while on the run during combat or puzzles. There could have easily been a few scenes of characters taking a moment of just getting to know one another or joking around together. Certain characters have a lot of chemistry with each other, and it would have been nice to see this more fleshed out. Had this been added, it could have increased the time length of the game as well. \n\n     This game has found its way not only into my top 5 favorite video games, but also deep into my heart. I highly, HIGHLY recommend this game and I’m so grateful that I was able to experience it. I will be playing this for a very long time. Big thanks and praise to the creators.",Recommended

The characters are all very easily attached to and the story is top notch. i'd put this on my top 10 games for certain. \nAll of the bugs mentioned in other reviews i haven't experienced, i never crashed during my 9ish hours played. The game mechanics change as you go through the game so it stopped it from feeling too repetitive although saving your brother every corner is a tad tedious. every boss fight felt different and just challenging enough to be enjoyable but not dark souls.  \n\nOverall: this game competes to game of the year games and possibly even beats them. gameplay is very fun, and continuously fresh while building on itself.

"This is an amazing game! I eagerly waited for this game since E3 of 2018 and it was even better than I had hoped. Beautiful graphics, excellent voice acting, great story, stellar soundtrack, extremely unique setting and atmosphere, and fun gameplay.

I almost felt bad for getting this game at $40 because it was just so good!\n\nI never heard of Asobo Studio before this, but I can promise you that I will be keeping an eye on their future work. This game is a Recommended work of art.\n\nIf you love single player games, this is a MUST HAVE.\n\nP.S. I had a little bug when I first started the game where my frame rate was getting stuck at 30 in some areas no matter what the graphics were set to, but I fixed it by changing the display mode from full screen to borderless window. This may have been a glitch exclusive to my system or may have been fixed by an update already, but if you experience this issue, try changing the display mode.

"A beautiful game visually, with an excellent soundtrack and definitely better-than-average voice acting. I'll admit, however, that it doesn't really feel like a ""full"" game - $45 for a game that is easily beatable in 12 hours, and offers very little ""sidequest"" type of content and an entirely on-the-rails playthrough is a bit steep. I'm sure the production costs were very high as it was, but realistically this game should be viewed as a short experience rather than as something you can really sink into for an extended period of time.",Recommended

"A Plague Tale: Innocence was announced two years ago as a game focused on storytelling. It’s absolutely Not Recommended! Stealth and RPG mechanics are the core of the game. Basically it’s a not so good replica of Dishonored: the same unhealty atmosphere, the same stealth and RPG mechanics, the same attention to sorcery and supernatural, the same killing rats. The medieval setting reminds me of another stealth game: Thief. Dishonored is in First Person View, on the contrary A Plague Tale is in Third Person View; in fact A Plague Tale has two main protagonists acting together: the 15 y.o. Amicia and her little 5 y.o. brother Hugo. It tries to imitate somehow the particular relationship between the main protagonists of The Last Of Us, but results are disappointing. \n\nSumming up with no spoilers, Amicia and Hugo have to face an horrible plague spread by hordes of ravenous rats and survive the Holy Inquisition. For the majority of the game, players need to utilize stealth to avoid hostile encounters. Amicia is equipped with a sling which can throw rocks to break drawbridge chains or stun guards long enough for the rats to ambush them, or even kill them with a headshot. The game is a series of survival puzzles, mostly consisting of methods to scare away or distract the hordes of hungry rats in order to gain access to new areas, or direct them towards enemies. The main method of warding rats off is fire, as rats will seldom enter within a radius of burning torches and braziers. Amicia can also craft special ammunition and supplies, which include fire-starting sulfur stones that ignite braziers, stink bombs that attract rats, or fire suppressants to extinguish torches carried by enemies. Amicia’s younger brother Hugo can be directed towards specific tasks when Amicia is busy. Later in the game, the player can assume control of Hugo, who cannot craft items but is able to control rats and sneak through small spaces. All these abilities are combined when the siblings unite in the late game. You’re adviced: mechanics and graphics are the best features of the game, the rest is forgettable! \n\nA Plague Tale is not the great game that mainstream magazines claim for. Plausibility and consitence of plot, characters psychologies and relationships are completely sacrificed to challenges; situations are improbable and sometime grotesque, story is really weird, weak and absurd, full of incoherence and discrepancies. All the good premises of the prologue made me think of a good narrative adventure at first, but they get irretrievably lost as the game progresses and ridiculousness turns up. E.g., the ending Dragon Balls Z fight is laughable! Dishonored has definitely better and more plausible story, characters and situations. \n\nProtagonists are children but they don’t act always like children, the most of the time they act as adults! It seems that children are there just for speculation, for creating contrast between the dark, bloody, violent medieval context and the supposed innocence amd fragility of children. The “innocent” and ""fragile"" Amicia killing hundreds of people with a toy sling will remain in the annals of Video Games! Completely laughable! In the prologue, the good and shy Amicia wasn’t even able to kill a boar with the sling; a few scenes after, she is able to kill soldiers with just one shot of her toy sling! She turns in a war machine able to defeat an entire army and win the Holy Inquisition with the help of a bunch of teens and children! Completely laughable! Characters are not real persons, they’re puppets that have to adapt behavior, thoughts, dialogues, feelings and emotions to improbable tasks and situations. Some secondary characters are inserted just for creating artificial and predictable dramatic moments. No doubt the game is aimed at a not demanding audience of teens. Developers focused exclusively on challenges and environmental puzzles that compromise design and credibility of game world and conflict with characters and story. The latter is just a dressing, it has been built around challenges and mechanics and not the contrary; it has no contents to express, it has nothing to say, it is there just for badly supporting the fun, and the fun is just facing challenges with an end in themselves! \n\nA Plague Tale cannot achieve the so called suspension of disbelief, as consequence player can never feel immersed in the experience. It’s not the only game falling in such mistake, let’s think of Tomb Raider Reboot. You’re the young Lara Croft learning to survive a wild nature and very bad people. You take a compelling path of growth, but at a certain point, towards the end of the game, credibility disappears and immersion gets lost! The need to engage players in extreme and bombastic challenges destroys the good story, the good psychology and atmosphere. Lara becomes a war machine, Rambo is nothing in comparison!! Gameplay falls into the obviousness of traditional challenges: shooting, bombing, fighting, killing, playing hide & seek, etc. A Plague Tale encounters similar problems. \n\nYou realize that something is wrong when you have to face senseless ending level boss! That completely destroys narrative breath and credibility, it’s just challenge for challenge’s sake. In order to make story interesting developers introduced alchemy and supernatural elements, but results are very weird and disappointing. Even the silly mechanic of rats invasion is there just for fun, for creating weird situations, challenges and puzzles, but it's just ridiculous! A Plague Tale is not boring, on the contrary it is fun, but you cannot say it’s a smart game; it’s an entertainment product for masses, aimed at players searching for stealth, action, challenges, puzzles but not interested in story, contents, psichologies, relationships, feelings, emotions etc. \n\nA Plague Tale is an indie game developed by Asobo Studios in France, but it has to be considered a triple A game because of the production supported by Focus Home Interactive. Asobo Studios are active since 2002, they are well known for games based on Disney cartoons, as Ratatouille, Wall-E, Toy Story 3 etc. etc. A Plague Tale comes with great graphics and animations, high quality cutscenes, good actors, long playtime around 12 hours; it’s a pity that such AAA resources were not used for creating a smarter experience. \n\nOnce again games like A Plague Tale put Video Games in a position of inferiority with respect to Cinema or Comics. Mainstream magazines are accomplices of such cultural “crime”; they welcomed the game with high ratings as one of the best surprise of 2019, underlining the narrative features! Absolutely Not Recommended! It’s a silly game good just for fun and mass entertainment, with a low-medium intellectual level, aimed at a young audience with low expectations. I want to be clear: there are far worse games than this, all in all I didn’t mind playing it, I had some fun by taking a lot of screenshots in the very useful photo-mode! Trying to sell the game for its narrative features is a big mistake, it’s like making fun of and tricking the players. \n\n(continues  here:  https://vgartsite.wordpress.com/2019/07/08/a-plague-tale-innocence/)",Not Recommended

And the story is good. Immerse yourself. Treat yourself.",Recommended
"It's a really good game. I love the story, the worldbuilding, sound design/score and the simple stealth mechanics. The performances from the actors are excellent. There is a pretty serious difficulty spike in the last couple of levels which is extremely frustrating though. Frequent checkpoints during the last boss battle in particular would go a long way to aleviating this.

I know some people get stuck but the hints start dropping too quickly. Navigation is great, theres no chance to get locked out of areas by accidentally triggering the progress of the game.\n\nThe whole game is ""Amicia we need to go!"" -hold on son, lemme get these mats.",Recommended
"I truly love this game! This is considered to be my favorite game of all time. I understand this game is not everyone's cup of tea due to how the story takes in a more small part of a huge story. The protagonist is only a teen, so you wouldn't expect to experience hardcore action from her. The game takes in a more refreshing approach to players, and that's how I like my games. I love the graphics, love the features, and obviously love the plot of the game. I love the characters, and how the bond between Hugo and Amicia seems so real. For those who are looking for an engaging story, but does not experience extreme action then I would recommend this game a full 100%. What is also a bewildering fact about the game is how it was only created by 40 people. This great graphic game was only made by 40 people. Truly hardworking people I must say. Thank you for taking your time into reading this review.",Recommended

"One MAJOR problem with this game, the AUDIO. Im really surprised i havent seen anyone else mention it yet. I was immediately taken out the game the second it started. The audio is TERRIBLE. Every bit of dialogue is shrouded in reverb and echos whether youre inside or out. \n\nSubtle shifts in camera position can make someone who sounds like there 50 feet away at first, end up sounding like there shouting in your ear, even though the actual character is a few feet away.\n\nNot to mention the cutscenes. Dialogue is there but it is extremely quiet and suffers from the same reverb and echo problems as the rest of the game.\n\nI was really looking forward to this game and am really disappointed i couldnt make it 30 minutes before refunding it.",Not Recommended

"Saw this game making the rounds and heard about it being a very solid game on many podcast for the last month or so. So when I saw it drop to around 30 bucks on Steam I decided to pick it up. If I could explain this game to someone I would say it plays like a very elementary Last of Us mixed with Metal Gear Solid stealth gameplay. It has very basic combat which mainly revolves around using a slingshot with rocks but combat is honestly not used a ton, its mostly a stealth hide & seek kind of game. Also has very basic puzzles from time to time thrown into the game.\n\nIt is set in the late 1300s around the time of the Plague and Rats are a key part of the game. You have to use items you craft to maneuver or get rid of the rats in many spots in the game. I read somewhere some screens have over 5000 active rats running in real time. Its very impressive technically. This is a really well made game but it is not a AAA game and that does show at times. While it has its flaws, such as some repetitive gameplay, retard free stealth mechanics (guards cant see their friends die sometimes or they quit chasing you after 5 feet etc), some pacing issues, it is still a great game. The voice acting and writing is SUPERB and the story is very well done.\n\nI give it a solid 7 or 8/10 and if you see it on sale, I highly recommend you give it a try if you are a fan of story driven games like this and got the itch to play a new one.",Recommended

"[h1]Heart, Charm & Depth;[/h1] these words are what represents this gorgeous game. Not only is this game [i]original, with unique gameplay[/i] and [i]entertaining story[/i] with [i]thrilling interactions[/i], it has definitely lived to the build-up of what the trailers showed.\n\nThis game is really immersive, as you play as Amica you find the beautiful world in which she lives in as the start. Showing the scenery around and how much detail there actual is. Within these first few minutes you really get a feel for the character and what she has and will go through. The introduction of the Inquisition is so vague at the start until you truly understand their actual power within the game. Understanding what they are capable of, motives and reasons are easily able to be picked up within the first couple chapters. The brutality of the Inquisition is so perfect is makes you shiver with every step you get near them. \n\nFollowing the characters of Amica and Hugo is breath taking that every little conversation with them is interesting and heartfelt that they are actually adorable. The bond they grow is so strong throughout the game it is represented well with little details like if you rear to far from Hugo he starts panicking, the little dialogues they have as you are walking passively through a forest, village, etc or just how much they stick by each other during stressful situations.\n\nThis game is magnificent but like most games has minor flaws. As you slowly notice you will realize that the characters will go through each other, the ground or the lips don't fully move with the voice. These little things are noticeable but don't impact the game severely. With the plot of the story you do see how confusing it may get or ridiculous as you progress as the first two-thirds of the game is completely idealistic, realistic and playable as you go through the chapters you do want to play more to find out what happens but as you continue the plot gets strange and tangled up somewhere as it slowly becomes a bit too fantasy for a game like this. As you come to the climax of the games story you do see the huge difference in how you feel at the start of the game and the end of it.\nOverall I would say this games is still massively impressive, with the ending going in a different directions that expected it still was fun, compelling and extremely enjoyable. The characters are one of the most interesting ones I've ever played in a long time with amazing side-characters too. The closest thing I can say about how the game play feels is that it was fairly close to The Last of Us and how it is run. With the little gathering system and upgrading being one of the similar reasons, how you operate your character with the camera and the third-person gives me that enjoyable vibe that The Last of Us gave me.\n\nI would recommend this game 100%, possible get it preferably on a sale like I did for $45aus instead of the $60 but I still would say if you have the money for it not on sale you should definitely still get it. \n\nI rate this game a [b]8.5/10[/b]",Recommended

"A magnificent blend of personal and heartfelt storytelling, stunning and at times harrowing and grotesque imagery, impeccable sound design and a beautiful and soul stirring soundtrack. This game has the level of quality and polish that puts most AAA games to shame and it is especially a commendable achievement because the game was made in a fraction of the budget most AAA games are made in and the game also had barely any pre-release hype or anticipation. I played the game on PC and the PC port is brilliant. Textures are beautiful and intricately detailed and of a commendably high quality almost throughout! This game has some of the best lighting I have seen in a videogame in recent years! The game didn't crash, freeze or glitch out even once, which has become a rarity these days, especially in PC gaming. A word of caution though, the PC version is quite demanding and you might need a powerful gaming rig to reach Ultra settings!\n\n  My only gripe with the game is that, while most of the characters are well written and layered, the main antagonist is dissapointingly generic and his motive feels like a typical megalomaniac motive!\n\n  Inspite of that gripe, A PLAGUE TALE: INNOCENCE is a brilliant game which deserves much more attention, applause and recognition than it is already getting!

"(tl;dr Scoring system in middle)\n\n*Movie trailer voice-over*\nIn a world where the landscape is nothing but lootbox, monetization focused ""games"" which really are just psychological addicting cash machines for corporations like Electronic Arts, Bethesda, Activision, Epic Games, etc. to make obscene amount of money for as little effort as possible-\n\nComes a Single-Player (genre deemed totally dead by ""E.A. Sports, It's In The Scam"" right around when God Of War PS4 came out) game made by goodguy(and goodgirl and goodnon-binary and goodattackhelicopter) dev team. No episode-formatting, or day-1 dlc, or cosmetic store. A middle high-tier fairly priced game with a great presentation, setting, story, voice-acting, and interesting stealth mechanic with a non-annoying and tight-yet fluid escort system. Think modern ICO with more stealth and quality of life with big emphasis on story, and plot in a dark but wonderous setting.\n\nThe beginning sets up everything very well without coming off as phoney and gives you a lot of incentive to continue and find out what happens next while exploring a very rich detailed world in a setting that isn't very common. Situations occur in a nice pace and by the time you are starting to familiarize yourself with the mechanics the plot starts to accelerate. It is a great balance of cinematic audience participation with immersive mechanical sequences and the transitions between the two states are very well done.\n\nWill update as I play more!\n\n\nTL;DR-\nCompletely Arbitary Scoring System - C.A.S.S. - Add up which thumbs you agree with and if you come up with-\n\n+4, insta-buy now (check https://isthereanydeal.com/game/outward/info/ first)\n+2, buy this game on sale, wishlist it now and waitlist it on ITAD to alert you to price drops\n+1, do more research, watch streams/reviews of trusted non-shill paid actor content (good luck finding that in 2019)\n0 or negative score - Try to improve yourself as a human being and help others and yourself to lead better lives, jk, stay classy\n\n👍 If you like a Medieval setting featuring the black plague\n👍 If you like stealth mechanics\n👍 If you like single-player narrative with strong connections between characters akin to well-developed movies/tv shows\n👍 If you're tired of live-service monetization and promises of fixed games in a year+ but lootboxes and day1 dlc at launch and miss the days of buying a full-featured game experience with all content planned at launch, delivered\n👍 If you want to support good people and play a part of improving the video-game industry\n👍 If you like unique experiences set in a underused beautiful setting with stark contrasts, great art, voice-acting and intrigue\n\n-\n\n👎 If you just want to spend your $20 allowance on a skin to show your friends and random strangers how cool you are and how much they suck\n👎 If you only play games in the top 5 twitch most viewed flavor of the week and call games with active playerbase less than 8 million ""dead game""\n👎 If you think games like Anthem and Fallout 76, companies like EA, Bethesda, Activision, Epic Games, etc. deserve even more money so they can fire more of their employees and give bigger bonuses to CEO\n👎 If you don't like stealth at this time\n👎 If you prefer ONLY action/shooting experiences at this time\n👎 If you cannot play as a female protagonist\n\nConclusion and Summary-\n\nThis is a very nice start and I really hope there will be more. Judging by the title and a bit of research pre-release, it sounds like they designed this as a self-contained experience but with room for expansion. The world is really interesting and it's such an untapped market with much potential.\n\nI definitely think we need more games like this in all the aspects it hits (setting/story/characters/mechanics/graphics/price model/etc.) and hope this succeeds as much as it deserves and really look forward to more and I literally uninstalled 3 open world loot box games, and many more I'm ashamed I ever even tried, to purge my game ssd and make room for Innocence and other better experiences. I feel no compulsion to reinstall those bandwagon generic majority wastes of space when I can just play this and others like it.

However the story ended up depicting the world as the medieval mind would have seen it.

"It is an interesting variation around the stealth genre where the main character is far from a professional killer an must find her way survive through the story. \n\nThe game is not very hard and is more about finding the path to sneak past guards or eliminate them one way or another than challenging execution or fighting, there is in general only one way. The IA of the guards is sometimes quite stupid but the overall ambiance and story to follow makes up for it. The game successes well at giving new situations and new ways of playing from beginning to end and though it's not very long (around 9-10 hours for most people, don't look at my time) it is a rich and satisfying experience without annoying parts.\n\nStory is compelling and engaging, characters are interesting and the ambiance is awesome, I think. I was a little worried originally that the little brother character would be annoying but actually the gameplay around him is well done and he's crucial to the story.\n\n",Recommended
"One of the best games I have played recently.\nThe story is very well written and I had a lot of fun in the dark medieval world. You for once are not the hero who can defeat anything in his way. Instead you sometimes have to run away, hide and be sneaky.\nThe game certainly has its small gameplay weaknesses, but the immersive world makes it forgivable and worth playing.",Recommended
"It's little bare-bones and linear. There are only a few sequences that open up enough to actually require you to use any critical thinking. At this point, I'm more excited about Asobo Studio's future than Plague. Still worth a play.",Recommended
"Single player games are dead, long live single player games my ass! This game was amazing a hand crafted story that was filled with effort and care. The character development was amazing as you really do feel connected to the people you are around. The world was beautiful and very dark all at the same time. Collection things to craft things for your sling really felt rewarding and the stealth, oh man don't even get me started. The 3rd person cam view only strengths the game. The time period in history it was sit in felt grounded like they really did make sure it felt like it was 1349. Of course they needed to add the so called ""Hollywood"" touch so it stays engaging and it worked wonders here.  Pick it up NOW since its on sale. Trust me and the reviews, you really do not wanna miss out on this one. All I can say  now after finishing the game is I hope there is more from this studio and hell a sequel would be amazing I really hope to see more from them soon!",Recommended
"I don't normally write reviews much, but when i saw this game to be compared to Last Of Us, it had to be done. Not recommending because i thinks this game is very average, if you buy this game because it has very positive and think its going to be level of Last Of Us you are going to be disappointed.\n\n Game looks pretty like it should be in 2019 nothing extraordinary, game feels like developers didn't have skill to make better or they didn't have time to make game feel smooth because it microstutters littlebit, not acceptable. Game feels good at start and feels something unique, if you look some here are reviewing this game only when they have clocked 4 hours in game time, just WOW they dont know what they are talking, beacuse i would too give this thumbs up if it would lasted only 7 chapters but it doesn't, game drags too long to complete + story starting to irritate the hell out of me.\n\n Save your money save your time this game is very average not interesting story at all witch is most important thing for me if i am playing this kind of linear game. And all you guys comparing this to Last Of Us i would suggest you to take some kind of brain damage treatment.\n\n2/5",Not Recommended
"I've been gaming since Super Mario Brothers on the NES in the 80s. I have to say, this is one of the best games I've ever played. \n\nFirst off, it's challenging, but not hard enough to make you want to quit. Second, It has a healthy mix of action, stealth, crafting, puzzles, and exploration. Third, it was one of the most engaging stories I've played in a long time. I didn't mind if I was playing or watching a cutscene. Lastly, the music was amazing and emotional and keeps you sucked right into the scene or scenario. It had action packed moments as well as quiet and heartfelt ones. \n\nFor those wondering if it is scary...it's not. I hate horror movies and games in general, and this wasn't any of those. I will post a caveat that if you're afraid of rats, it could possibly be scarier for you than it was for me. In general though the game doesn't rely on jump scares or common horror tactics, so don't let name fool you. \n\nSome may find the game a bit linear, and it is, but there is plenty in each chapter to keep a gamer interested. I actually kind of get sick of open world sandbox games, so this one was a very nice surprise. If you're seeking an open world game where you like to explore every corner of a map, this game is not it. \n\nI had never heard of this game and it made it into page 3 or 4 of one of the lists I was searching during the summer sale. Best $30 I've spent in a long time. \n\nI don't know why Sean Bean was in the teaser trailer, he didn't make an appearance in the game. Perhaps the studio wanted some additional clout behind their title, but this game just proves that you don't need big names to make an amazing game.",Recommended

"This game was a big surprise of the year and it was better than I expected it to be. It’s also different, as I’ve never seen a game that is so attractive and fun before, I mean words may not be enough to express it but it really is.\n\nThe story is very intriguing and it somehow makes you want to play and know more about it as quickly as possible. The stealth elements are also well presented and utilized, it incorporates a rather simple but unique stealth approach which is different from other stealth themed games. The puzzle elements are excellent and the characters and environment are lovely and interesting, you can feel a deep relationship with them when you play as them. \n\nHowever if you suffer from musophobia, then you probably can’t play this game (I’m not joking when I said that).

"Before playing A Plague Tale, my favourite game was The Last Of Us. But now the tables have turned and I can safely say this was my all time favourite single player experience I have EVER had the pleasure of experiencing. After the first 20 minutes I fell in love with the game and the characters. Some animations might be choppy here and there but my god what a ride!! Dark, Emotional, Gripping. Everything I want in a game, no game has hit those marks perfectly apart from this one... I have a new love for a subtle french accent and I want to rename my dog Hugo! Really Really enjoyed this one. would HIGHLY recommend.",Recommended
"If you enjoyed Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice then you will enjoy this. \n   Gameplay: The game is probably the most stressful non-horror game I have ever played, and I loved that! The stealth and combat mechanics work well and I was always trying to find the most interesting ways to sneak by someone or kill them. \n   Graphics: The game is visually stunning, however the character animations are a bit stiff and feel out of place in such a well made game. \n   Sound and Music: Voice acting was great and so was the music. Everything fit perfectly.\n   Story: The plot moves along at a good pace I was always eager to see what was around the next corner, however many of the side characters and the antagonists were cliche. Also the ending, while entertaining to play, was rather disappointing compared to the rest of the game.",Recommended

The game as a whole is simply just an enjoyable experience, strongly recommend.",Recommended
Awesome story-driven game.,Recommended
"A Plague Tale: Innocence is a solid little AA 10 hour story-ish style game in 14th century France amidst both the 100 Years War with England as well as the Black Plague. The game follows the story of Amicia and Hugo de Rune, children of ~15 and 5ish years of age respectively, as they flee the plague and the Inquisition, a group that has purged infected villages and, for some reason, wants Hugo.\n\nGameplay is mostly sneaking around with some simple puzzles and a few simple weapons to distract or kill guards or rats. Amicia (your playable character) dies in 1 hit to anything, and killing many enemies requires them not being aware of your presence, so there isn't really a way to just plow your way through like many other stealth style games. There is also a crafting component to upgrade your equipment, although it could very easily have been replaced with periodic automatic upgrades throughout the story instead.\n\nThe story itself isn't terribly amazing, but the interactions between the characters are fantastic. Hugo is just a sweet little boy, and Amicia is just a teenage girl trying to keep her and her brother alive through a very dark time.\n\nOverall, I think if you like the general backdrop of Medieval France then the game is worth getting now. It's a little above a Recommended story style game, as you're almost constantly confronted by enemies of some sort, but I certainly wouldn't call it a ""normal"" game in terms of gameplay, making it quite a light and quick game, and so it's probably for the best to wait until its around a 50% sale.",Recommended
"A truly amazing story, a must have for those who are still into singleplayer games on PC.",Recommended
"TLDR: Great setting, but the developers play too much Tomb Raider. Not much of a story. No reason to care about the characters. \n\nA great setting with great characters that's completely bogged down by game mechanics. the gameplay is far too reliant on the rat mechanic.\n\nThey missed an opportunity for a great story game here. The opening sequence was amazing, but it didn't hold up. The story is pretty dull, i was hoping to see more horror and realistic scenarios of loss from the dark ages. The game also doesn't do much to set you up to like the characters who die. \n\nThe only character death I cared about was the blacksmith boy, but it would have hit even harder if we started to see a romance between him and the main character. \n\nAs far as mechanics go, they should have let us play as the other characters. There's one sequence where you play as Hugo, so we know that they have the ability to let us do that, and it would have been awesome to swap between the characters for different scenarios. \n\nMy guess is that this game was rushed out the door, and they didn't make the game that was intended. \n",Not Recommended

"A surprisingly enjoyable game! It's linear, as other have said, but it never got boring for me. Not a difficult game, but its very beautiful and has a good story. Pulled me right in. I also liked the way the game gives hints on what to do: the NPC's give you advice. And sneaking around as a 5 year old was a hoot!\n  The only real negative I could come up with, something that bothered me throughout the game, was the blank stare of the main character. While talking to NPC's, it never seemed like she was actually looking at them, just had that blank thousand yard stare.\n  Buying it on sale for $34, I felt like I got my money's worth. It's probably not good for an immediate replay, but in a month or two I plan to do it again.\n  Never played a game quite like this, but am glad I got this one.",Recommended

"This game has great story and fantastic acting but the gameplay itself is merely okay. I am a gameplay over story type gamer so I will dedicate this review purely to gameplay, if you are a story over gameplay type person, you should absolutely get this game because in that aspect, it's great.\n\nThe basic gameplay in this is escaping from overwhelming threat, third person stealth and environmental puzzles. The escape from threat mechanics felt so heavily scripted that you never actually feel threatened. You basically follow a maze with no wrong turns or dead ends until you come across a cutscene. The stealth part of the game is the best part of it but feels weak compared to other stealth games, it's very forgiving, enemy AI is super basic and you end up with tools that allow you to bypass the stealth aspects almost entirely very early on. The environmental puzzles are very basic and will not challenge anybody, more often than not those puzzles are just annoying and feel like a waste of time.\n\nI didn't finish the game because I came across a game breaking bug towards the end of chapter 10. I read up on it and it turns out that replaying the chapter might fix it. I might have done that for a better game but as a game this title is quite average so I can't even be bothered.",Not Recommended

"This game starts off good. The protagonist is great, the graphics are amazing, and the setting is fantastic. The gameplay, though, is nothing but one long escort mission. And most of the time, the one you're escorting is the brattiest piece of crap little brother you could find. The only reprieve you get from the escort mission is when you have to rescue the little brat after he gets captured because he was a little brat. Oh, and when you have to play as the little brat because he ran away and gave himself to the enemy because he was being a little brat.\n\nOh, and the game wants you to feel sympathy for the people you kill. If nothing else, this game reminded me that there are historical people that are actually worse than Nazis, so fat chance making me feel bad about killing the psychos. After chapter 12, the game becomes truly tedious. And of course, one of your friends dies because they didn't make sure the enemy was properly dead after having several tons of rocks dropped on them, so of course the enemy had no broken bones or anything and was able to recover in a few seconds and slaughter them, leaving you to play hide and seek since you can't kill them.\n\nI definitely regret having bought this at release, and am going to try to slog my way to the end since I'm so close, but it's so boring and tedious now.\n\nOh, and no replay value.\n\nReading the positive reviews and the forums, I feel like you people have never played a good video game before. Masterpiece? Brilliant? WTF is wrong with you people?\n\nEdit: Finished it after a couple of extremely tedious trial-and-error boss fights involving rat tornadoes.",Not Recommended

"There's not much to say about the game so this will be casual and short. From start to finish, just about everything in the game short of the facial animations is absolutely stellar. If it is ever in your budget, buy it. Youtube/Twitch Let's Plays will not serve as a replacement for playing this linear game yourself, and it is worth it if you like story-driven games with a mix of stealth and action, walking, and breathtaking sights to see.\n\nThe game in a normal playthrough will last you a little over 10 hours. 100% achievement completion will obviously take a fair amount longer than that. The visuals are some of the best out there - I'll address that more momentarily. The gameplay is mostly stealth-focused but you always have the option of getting into a little action (along with some fun on-the-rails action sequences). Boss fights are a little silly to be honest, even if they manage to look pretty badass at the same time. I felt they introduced characters in a jarring way normally... sometimes they become best friends with undying loyalty a few minutes after meeting. What did I do to deserve their kindness and goodwill in a dying world? Anyways, everything after introducing them is feels heartfelt and genuine. I feel like the ending leaves room for a sequel, although I am not sure we will ever get one. Nevertheless, the ending we get is satisfying.\n\nNow let me gloat over the visuals... They just might be my favorite of all time. With a gtx 1070 and running an ultrawide fix with a wider FOV at 3440x1440 I ran a consistent 40-50 fps on max graphics. Playing this game at around 45 fps for the extra visual boost was TOTALLY worth it for me. You can see it in the first 30 seconds of the game; a golden farm in the background with you at the edge of a forest in the thick of autumn and a small set of ruins nearby still lit by the mid-morning fog and gentle godrays/lightshafts. Almost every chapter after the intro has a unique setting... some breathtakingly beautiful, other grotesque, or twisted and almost supernatural. These are realistic graphics yet with a unique sense of style and identity. I would've bought this were it just a walking simulator. And lastly... the rats. They are a technical achievement and I hope the team is proud of what they accomplished with them. Again, you can only properly understand the feeling these rats give off if you play this YOURSELF, so [b]BUY IT[/b]\n\n\nSo yeah. Vermintide: The Pre-Sequel is a great game and is worth your money when it is in your budget.",Recommended

"Up until thus far the game  has not disappointed me seen as the story line is not as predictable as you might think, the idea of a plague has a lot of factors that dictates what people would do to survive during a crisis and how even those who use to have power are over ruled by situations that are not in their hands nor in anyone else's. The puzzle's are not that extreme but can have numerous outcomes if you can use your imagination to work around it or just burn through it with no skill if you are just there so see how the story ends. Thumbs up to the developers and who ever thought  to have so much corpses of human or pig in one place... i like games that give you that horrific image of what might as well have been real during historical events.",Recommended
"I heard a lot of good things about this game but, sadly, was disappointed.\n\nIt wasn't all bad, definitely. The game was very pretty and had a good soundtrack, but unfortunately, I just couldn't connect to it. The story was meh; very weak at some specific scenes and overall quite predictable and cliché. The bad guy is just another power obsessed ugly old man; nothing intelligent about it. The scene where you're walking towards him right before the end fight was a little too cliché in my opinion. And no, I haven't spoiled anything; the story is so cliché that you weren't gonna be surprised anyway.\nThe controls are straightforward though, and the stealth puzzles are reasonably easy, though they sometimes require good timing.\n\nOverall 3.5/10 at most, unfortunately. I will be listening to the soundtrack every once in a while though.",Not Recommended
"This review is only my opinion. Please don't get triggered. \n\nStory is nothing special, and it's not emotional as well. Most of the supporting characters are quite shit. I wouldn't care if all of got eaten alive by rats. The enemy AI is close to non-existent. The gameplay is dull and repetitive and frustrating when enemies see you behind walls. Oh, the companion AI is also shit, sometimes breaking the game entirely and needing a restart because you need those dipshits to progress through a region. Graphics and music is very nice but good graphics is NOT a reason to buy a game so expensive. \nIf you absolutely want to buy this shit game, play it slowly maybe that will make it feel less repetitive.

"Overall great game. Linear story driven adventure with likeable characters, stealth gameplay, and puzzles involving moving objects or interacting with light sources to get around guards and swarms of rats. Some of the stealth sequences and puzzles can become repetitive by the end but overall the game does a good job of increasing the complexity and giving you more options throughout.\n\nThe main characters (15 year old Amicia and her 5 year old brother Hugo) provide a nice contrast to the horrors of war and plague around them and I found their dialogue and interactions to be well written.\n\nThe music in the game was also very well done, setting the tone for each scene.\n\nNever encountered any technical issues or crashes and game looked very good visually. I played on an I5 3570 CPU and a GTX 1070 GPU on high settings with no problems.\n\nIf you like games like Hellblade or the Last of Us, you'll enjoy A Plague Tale.",Recommended

Well written with top notch voice acting, a good soundtrack, excellent visuals with stunning art design and a real bleak, heavy atmosphere. Worthy of a second play through too, if only to find all of the interesting collectables littered throughout.  \n\nRecommended.",Recommended
"One of the best games of 2019, from the graphics to the story and characters, to the setting, to the acting all of it is amazingly well done and the use of the black death as the backdrop for the story is so unique and original, I absolutely love this game and I hope this studio does more like this or possibly even makes a sequel set in the same universe it would be awesome.\n\nHighly recommended it is definately a instant classic and amazing feat for an indie developer to pull off\n\n9/10",Recommended

The \nGraphics are amazing. And the immersion is top notch. This is \nDefinitely a puzzle stealth game. And I like that. The story is\nAlso just top notch. The way the game uses concepts and\nTeaches them to the player is also so immersive. So almost 10\nhours in I finally beat this AMAZING GAME. The characters are\nso well written. The story was also just a heart wrencher. \nif you are looking for a single player story driven game this is the\none to buy.\n\ntl;dr buy this game its great!",Recommended
"A 10 hour long game that feels like 50 and makes you wish it were 100, no words can really give justice to what the brand new Asobo Studio have accomplished. It looks exactly like the screenshots, the soundtrack is heart wrenching and the plot is a multi facet'd journey of an older sister keeping her brother alive. At least that's the first half of the game. As the brilliant plot unfolds, your brothers survival is less a matter of family and more about the fate of the world.\n\nWhat's important to note however is this is not about 'the' plague. It's set at the same time and is a different take. Similar to how you could say Skyrim is set in medieval times but with dragons. \n\nThe game is at times horrifying, beautiful, sad and uplifting.\n\nThe graphics are just above and closest comparable to what I saw with Mafia 3, but there is absolutely no performance hit. I have a GTX 1060 and although the introduction sequence was laggy, the rest of the game ran on ultra like a dream. \n\nBuy at full price, I am very keen like many others to see what else Asobo can come up with in the future. If Plague Tale: Innocence is just the beginning, the standard of story-driven games is about to change.\n\nMy one gripe is unfortunately a spoiler so go read someone else's review if you haven't bought it yet!\n\n[spoiler]More people should have died, unless they are marking this up for a sequel (which i honestly don't think is possible or necessary) the last act would have been 100x more effective if it ended up being just Hugo and Amicia left. The happy ending too was a little meh for me just coming out of the literal hell that the plague caused.[/spoiler]\n\nEDIT: A lot of negative reviews talk about the pace and the puzzles and they're absolutely right. The puzzles are not particularly difficult and sometimes there are time-wasting activities but at no point did I find the game 'boring'.\n\nThe 'time wasting' activities always have dialogue and they are often excuses for character development. Basically an interactive cutscene. The Witcher 3 and many other single-player games would rather the player pad out their time fetching shit across the map which is much less interesting. \n\nTomb Raider is boring and bogs you down with puzzles, unlike this game which takes some cunning and even sometimes difficult choices to get past a situation.\nI couldn't get past 2 hours of Hellblade because Senua moved at 3mp/h. Compared to those two (which this game is a hybrid of), Plague Tale still comes out on top I feel. Plague Tale definetly stands on its own now though.",Recommended
"I can't rate this highly enough.\n\nWhile some of the mechanics can be clunky or cumbersome at times this has the most engaging and moving story in a game since Witcher 3. no this game isn't historically accurate, and yes it goes off the rails and goes damned near crazy towards the end. This is a deeply engrossing game that I no-lifed over the course of two days.\n",Recommended
Really beautiful game. One of the better story driven games. Game paste is just keep you going and going till the end. Graphics and land scape are so amazing to look at and to company with fitting music. I hope there are more games coming from Asobo studio.,Recommended
Great story and gameplay!,Recommended
"I honestly done have any words to say for this game other than it's amazing. I'm about 2 and a half hours into it and i'm completely invested in the plot and characters! For those of you that have played Hellblade, you will totally understand how i feel about this game.",Recommended
Very good stealth game but not to difficult.,Recommended
"I devoured this game in one sitting.  Or did the game devour my time and I woke up somewhere on the right end of the Ratpocalypse.  \n\nWe may never know. \n\nThis game is legit.  There will be a few moments that frustrate and the controls seem more suited to a console controller than keyboard and mouse, but none of this detracts from a compelling storyline with great characters. \n\n10/10 will run through plague ridden Europe with a sick boy and a slingshot again.",Recommended
Just finished and enjoyed it to the max.\nReally nice to look at didn't notice any graphical flaws\nDeep and interesting story although some parts were left unexplained but didn't bother me towards the ending.\nHoping there will be a second game and the ending felt like it was leaning a bit towards a continuing,Recommended

"A gritty game that will surprise you. The story is fantastic. It engages you from the beginning. I started it and wound up playing it the entire evening. \n\nThe characters feel like real people. The voice acting, the music, the game-play, all of it is memorable and engaging. Although most of the game is stealth, as a player you feel the way the characters feel. You feel the horror of their situation.  \n\nTruly one of the best story-based games I have played in a long time. If you enjoy quality stories with engaging stealth game-play, this is a game for you.",Recommended

"I really loved the story and game play for this game, but I will admit that it did feel a bit easy. The sneaking element is almost not needed once you upgrade all your gear. I do understand that the game is more challenging if you sneak, but half way through you can literally just wreck soldiers with the sling, so some sneaking elements are lost. \n\nIn regards to that, the story is phenomenal and was very hard for me to put down. I beat it in two sittings and have already started another play through to get the achievements. \n\nHighly recommend.",Recommended

"Good story with likeable characters. Visuals, music, lighting and narrative combined to helped create a immersive world. Controls are on par for this type of games, although some crafted items will have very little use depending on your play style.\n\nThe world is not an opened one, where (sometimes) conspicuous borders on landscapes and street dead ends bounds the world around you. On vast open grounds, enough detailed visuals are placed far away that you don't feel too bounded, but still know that you are funneled down a path.\n\nSome of the characters are undoubtedly less memorable because they make less of an appearance in the entire game. The rest of the characters are largely enjoyable to listen to during their interactions.\n\nIn general, going stealth is the usual way to go, because as soon as you are relatively close to the enemies, out numbered and spotted, things end quickly for you. It is not a difficult game, so anyone who is a regular gamer should have no trouble completing the game.\n\nYour companions helps out as you pass orders to them on various sections of the game, which actually helps you care for the characters and enhances their character, so that you don't simply treat them as inorganic objects.\n\nIn my opinion, in a heavily story-driven game, replayability is less of a concern, and sometimes additional contents in an attempt to increase replayability is counter productive in such games. And this one is on the right ball park in my opinion, it has low replayability, where one might want to replay for completing achievements by discovering secret collectables that gives additional information about the world. But they are not straightly necessary to enjoy the game, or too important for the story telling, so only really keen achievement hunters would go after them.\n\nHowever, even though this game is good in a lot of the ways, it lacks a little x-factor that can make a game great. There is simply nothing ground breaking about this game. And given the style, story, gameplay combination, I think it is quite impossible to make this game any better than it already is.\n\nOverall the game feel well polished and attention had been paid to details which I greatly appreciate. (Kingdom Come: Deliverance is the great example in recent memory that exhibits less than ideal resources in the polishing department) The style of game play is tested and tried. The story is interesting although not surprising. I also enjoyed the story-telling, atmosphere and world of the game. Great effort from the developers, I will be keeping an eye on them for further developments.\n\nAll in all, I give it 8/10.",Recommended
"Fantastic, Outstanding and Rich this game is truly a masterpiece! From the gorgeous graphics to the gorgeous story telling this game kept stirring my emotions.

"great game, lovely characters and a breathtakingly atmosphere and beautiful story",Recommended
"Let me start out by saying that the story line was immersive. I was deeply involved in the characters. Their stories drew me in and kept my attention. If you are a gamer that likes a lot of stealth games you will love this game. At times I got frustrated because I couldn't save manually and only autosave at checkpoints.The game is divided into Chapters. If I progressed to a point in a Chapter and was killed, I had to go all the way back to a previous checkpoint. That was frustrating especially if I had reached a difficult point, gotten past it and then died right before the game saved at the next checkpoint. Some Chapters were easier to get through than others. I used a keyboard to navigate the game. It may have been easier to use a controller. I admit I didn't switch over and that may have made it more difficult for me. I felt the ending was weak. The build up to the ending was involving, engaging, dramatic, but the end was a let down. The story drew me in, got me involved in the characters and their well being but the end left me hanging. I needed a resolution, like what happened to the characters after all was over, how they went on with their lives, what happened to the plague, to people, etc. I still recommend this game. The developers could have made a stronger ending, though.",Recommended
"With surprisingly good graphics and a brutally gripping story, this game is quite captivating. It is a fairly linear experience, though, with very little exploration. Controls can feel a bit clunky at times, but not as much as in some other games. I'm not far into the game, but there has been a minor puzzle solving aspect to it as well, including in one of the few combat scenes. The linear adventure games generally aren't my cup of tea, but this game does it very well.",Recommended
Story driven and a great game! Perfect medieval atmosphere.,Recommended
"I really like this game. Interesting story, memorable characters and dark gloom atmosphere with great graphics and levels design.\nGameplay is more controversial and mostly consists of easy stealth with stupid enemies and environment puzzles.",Recommended

"A Plague Tale is a tour de force of game development. Created by a relatively small development team, it achieves graphical prowess and a level of mechanical polish that many AAA developers struggle to match. The atmosphere, and largely unexplored historical period (in works of fiction) create a harrowing and refreshingly different setting for a game.\n\nPros:\n\n- I absolutely loved playing it. It turns its stealth elements into a puzzle of evading and dispatching your enemies. Not to mention the actual puzzles of avoiding the terrifying swarms of plague rats.\n- Immersive Mode is definitely the way to play. The standard setting leans toward hand-holding.\n\n- The campaign is about the perfect length and has near flawless pacing (for my tastes at least). No mechanic is over-used. With each new section comes either a new mechanic or a new spin on a familiar idea.\n\n- Also worth mentioning, the musical score is fantastic.\n\nCons:\n\n- The actual narrative is the area with the most notable room for improvement. That's not to say it's bad, by any means. But when it comes to narrative-driven games, it just doesn't have the same kind of natural acting performances as other narrative-driven games like God of War (2018), The Last of Us, or Hellblade: Senua's Sacrafice (which also had a small development team).\n\nSome of it is the writing - which has the characters talk and act more like they're from a modern young adult book series, than French orphans in the 14th century.\n\n- Even so, I think given the same script, if they had used performance capture with the actors, rather than recording lines in a sound booth, that may have resulted in more natural feeling characters. It may have also improved the animation, which again, wasn't bad; but compared again to Hellblade, it doesn't stack up.\n- Some recommend setting the spoken language to French, and using subtitles; not sure if this would help, but maybe worth a try. \n\nFinal Thoughts:\n\n- That being said, I still enjoyed the characters and thought the acting was generally good - especially Hugo and Amicia (the two leads). The performances are just more comparable to something like Life is Strange than Hellblade.\n\n- The story itself felt unique. Very few games or movies have a setting that even resemble A Plague Tale. Though there are some familiar story beats, and a somewhat cliché videogame villain, the way things play out is rarely predictable, and even surprising at times.\n\n\nOverall:\nI loved this game. It is harrowing, fun, unique, and thoroughly well-made. Hats off to Asobo Studio. It just shows that a small team of extremely talented and passionate people can outdo any amount of corporate tenacity. I want to see more games like A Plague Tale, and I'm excited to see what's next from Asobo Studios.",Recommended
"10/10 experience\n8/10 story\n\nI found myself so wrapped up with the environments, that I couldn't help but finish this game in a single sitting.\n\nThere were so many opportunities where I was sure the game was presenting me an option.

Where as most triple A games become a chore to play so much that you end up forcing yourself to finish. This game kept me engaged and held my attention throughout its world. Outside of some awkward game play moments especially the last third of the game this is almost a near perfect experience.  9/10 please buy this game if your are able and support the team that made this game.",Recommended
"The Game looks amazing but the story is nothing special, the final fight is tedious just like all of them are, you'd get the same experience on Youtube",Not Recommended
"This is a quality stealth game. The levels are well designed, the gameplay is engaging, the characters are interesting (although there is a moment at the end where one of your side characters gets done in, and there should totally be the ability to save that person, considering the way it's set up). I do recommend this game.\n\nThe only big flaw it has is that there are secrets for you to discover along the way, collectibles like flowers and objects, and sometimes you reach a place where there seems to be two ways to go. One way leads to a secret, the other continues the chapter, and it's not immediately clear which way is which. Once you go in the direction that continues the story, the game locks you completely out of going back and collecting the collectible. The only way to get it is to start the entire chapter over. And sadly, there isn't a lot of replayability here. The puzzles and options aren't quite clever enough for you to want to go back and try them again. If things were designed to allow you multiple ways to solve things, that would make it fun to play over, but they don't. There is one route, and one route only. So once you hit one of those multiple routes, you either find the secret and then continue on your way toward the story, or you miss the secret, continue on with the story, and never go back and get it because what's the point?\n\nIt's worth a playthrough, but don't expect to be playing it over and over again. It's incredibly linear.",Recommended
This game is absolutely a wonderful adventure. I will be looking forward to the developers future games.,Recommended
"Amazing game, with amazing graphics, and amazing story. Gameplay was light, but it was more about the journey than the challenge of gameplay. Had to take breaks between chapters as the story gets depressing, but more so because you know events like this happened. If you enjoy the slow burn and pacing of a good book then you'll probably enjoy this game also. Highly recommended.",Recommended

"First,  this game is a bear on your CPU. If you don't have a nice CPU, don;t expect fast framerates on higher settings. Second, I'm usually not a fan of linear, story driven games which A Plague Tale very much is. So. I'm quite surprised by how much I enjoy this game. A Plague Tale: Innocence takes place in 1300s France. You play as a teenage girl as you and her brother navigate the dangers of the inquisition and the rat plague. The story is serious, frightening, and full of emotional moments. The characters have a lot of depth and act how you would imagine real people would if put into these scenarios.  Gameplay consists of basic stealth and environmental puzzles. You craft items, push blocks and crates, and sneak  up on enemies. Gameplay bears a striking resemblance to the Playstation game ""The Last of Us"".  Graphics are impressive, especially from a small studio. Lighting is rich and dynamic. Shadows behave realistically. Attention to detail is put to a fine point. If you like games with open worlds or complicated gameplay systems, this game isn't for you. If you like games with unique settings that aren't often explored in games, emotionally heavy stories, and simple linear gameplay; then give this one a go. Great accomplishment from a small studio.",Recommended
"Plague tale innocence is one of the best games I have played this year. Played it till it was done for a few days and loved every minute of it.\nThe lighting, graphics and atmosphere of the game are amazing and you definately feel the fear of the characters around you.\nIt was a refreshing change to play a game that was not open world bogged down by farming for materials to craft. This was a wonderful linear styled game. The game has very light crafting elements, which did force you to explore the maps you were in as much as possible. But as always with risk, comes reward! And it was tense exploring maps fully to collect as much as possible.\n\nA fantastic game, beautiful engine powering the game, (amazing it was built in-house!) and wonderful characters. Very good voice actors to make the game come to life and be as authentic as possible.\n\nA great game, and by far worth full price.",Recommended
"Didn't really know what I was expecting from this game because most new games now days aren't that great anymore. So I decided to get because it was on sale this summer, and I was amused by the combination of the sounds, music and the atmosphere. The story takes place during the Black Plague outbreak in the 14th century of France. The game play was longer than I expected. I was able to complete it within 13 hours, minus getting all of the achievements. Overall, I think this game was worth playing and I wouldn't mind recommending it to other people.",Recommended

"This is a fantastic game! It is indeed a very story driven game, is very ""personal"" (as you see yourself constantly making decisions about the fate of both you and your brother) and edgy, since it has a urgency in every action. It may give you nightmares as well, with all the rats. Waited for it since it was announced and so far has not disappointed.",Recommended

"A gripping, emotional story set in a fascinating setting of 14th century France. \nThe gameplay and stealth mechanics are serviceable and open up in interesting ways as you progress but the game is lacking of any sort of challenge for the most part.\nIt also features a surprisingly robust crafting and upgrade system. \nVisually, A Plague Tale is a stunning game with beautifully realized, dense and detailed environments. The facial animations are rough at some points but it never gets too distracting.\nWriting and voice acting are another strong suits and they, along with the rich environments, really helps to immerse the player into the world.\nStrong writing also helps to establish all the key characters and you actually start caring for them as the story develops. This also helps to raise the stakes of the story to a new level.\nIt's a mostly linear experience and you can finish it in about 10-12 hours with little to none replay value.\nOverall, definitely a must buy for anyone who enjoys story driven adventures.\n  \n\n",Recommended

In terms of visuals, the lighting, textures, and overall graphics are stunning. The graphics are so good that you'd expect and forgive some choppy performance; but, incredibly, the framerates were consistent and the overall performance was amazing. This thing is a marvel of engineering. But then... there's the enemy AI... well, no game is completely perfect I suppose.",Recommended
"The best rat Physics i've seen in a video game by far, \n8/10",Recommended
"This game is ok, in that its functional. The stealth mechanics are the same we've seen done better in older games like the last of us, or assassin's creed. The story doesn't have the emotional impact that it feels like it's going for.  The dialogue feels unnatural and all of this combined makes me either indifferent to the characters to spiteful.  The character design is cool,  I enjoyed the costume design, graphics, and environment.  For a good portion of the game it feels like all of the worst parts of a escort quest.  The enemy ai is predictable which arguably makes the stealth consistent but the difficulty of the stealth comes from light puzzle solving that seems aimed at a younger player base and makes for low tension or boring gameplay. I enjoy puzzles,  but they're so easy I just feel like I'm playing a walking simulator. I didn't mean to come off as harsh here,  I think the ground work for a really amazing game was there and it fell just short of breaking through the uncanny valley, even though as I said it earlier the graphics are really really good.",Not Recommended

"To keep it short and simple, its a great game but not flawless. The voice acting at times feels cheesy and a bit poor, some game play mechanics get repetitive, and its a bit pricey. However, the story is really satisfying and even unpredictable which i really like. The game play feels realistic for how much your character can do (a teenage/young adult girl wouldn't be able to fist fight the inquisition, so having her use a sling is nice so she isn't even close to a Mary Sue).\n\nI recommend getting this game if you have enough money. Easily a 3.5-4/5 for me.\n\n\nAlso now I get paranoid when i see a rat, thanks game",Recommended

"Simply one of the best games I've ever played. The gameplay is simple yet very effective, the puzzles are great and on point, the difficulty is at a right level (not easy enough to get bored nor hard enough to be frustrated), the visuals and setting are stunning (really, one of the best in the market right now), voice acting is quite credible and an amazing work, overall sound is perfect. But most importantly, the story is beautiful and at a level that made me feel close to every character, I shared their pain, their anger, and their brief moments of joy. Once I finished it, I've been trying to fill the void it left on me like only one game has (damn you the last of us!). In the technical aspects of the game, it ran so smoothly that I only had a fps drop once during my full 14 hours playthrough; the only negative aspect of the game that bothered me was the lack of good facial animations, but that is all. Coming from a small studio, this gem came as a surprise, and it will surely linger in me for a very long time. Truly a wonderful experience that will be hard to be topped.",Recommended
better than sex.,Recommended
"The balance of story telling and stealth gameplay makes this title a fun medium paced experience. While some might find the stealth sections to be lacking in challenge, I think that it is a good middle ground between being prohibitive to those wanting to just enjoy the story and being boringly easy. Combat can be a bit clunky at first, but with practice and a few crafting upgrades it becomes much more fluid.",Recommended
This game offers a wonderfully dark story that is stunning. Enjoyed every second of it.,Recommended
"A Plague Tale Innocence is an unexpected game that no one would ever hear about this year. I was randomly watching a MrBeast video and made me not skip an ad for the first time in ever. I watched the teaser/announcement trailer and I was very impressed. I knew this would be a stealth based story driven game but I wanted to give this game a go!\n\nSo I feel like the story has some sort of the Last of Us kind of feel towards it, but set in a fantasy 14th century France where Rats, the Inquisition, Citizens and English Soldiers are your enemies. And you have to find out the mystery of why Hugo and the De Rune family plays a vital role in the story, and how you will have to protect Hugo. I actually liked the interactions towards characters you meet with the advantages they can give you on certain levels. There are a ton of hidden collectables throughout the game, and you can go back to certain levels to find those collectables and get them. \n\nThe gameplay felt pretty simple to me, but with added soundtrack to distract enemies or when enemies are around it adds suspense throughout my experience in the game. In stealth sections my heart is beating that I wouldn't get detected, otherwise you can get killed in one shot. Soundtrack is amazing in this game and it adds more richness toward the game.\n\nMy few negatives is the final level. It is infuriating the way I played it, it can differ towards other people but that is my only negative part of the game along with the simplistic puzzles in the game.\n\nOverall, I feel like you get more value when this game is either on sale or at full price for $60 Australian Dollars, for me I feel like this game is one of my favourites of 2019.\n\nI give this game a full 10/10",Recommended

Despite what EA thinks, some us of still like really compelling single player games instead of the live service crap they shovel out to meet sales expectations.  I feel as though I got my money's worth even at full price.",Recommended
"I loved this game.  I was a bit hesitant to get it, because it is based so much around the story.  It is a linear story and your actions don't seem to matter.  There is plenty to explore and do that it didn't feel like walking from one movie clip to another.  The game ends with unanswered questions that I'm hoping will be addressed in a sequel.  \n\nI also usually don't like games with little kids because the kids are obnoxious.  They did a good job of not making him too needy and temperamental, but also not making him be the equivalent to a dog companion.  The fact that I didn't hate him and low-key want him to die really showcases how great the main characters were written.  I wish I learned more about some of the side characters, but the story wasn't about them.\n\nThe graphics and sound were great.  I'm a real grown up with a mortgage and I wanted to sleep with the light on to keep the rats away because I was so absorbed into the atmosphere.",Recommended

Man what can i say about this game. It has been quite a while since I last played a game that I enjoyed this much. This may be the most cliche review so far but there is very little you can say about this game that will be negative. This game is proof that story driven games or the single player experience is 100% alive and kicking. I am little more than half way through but i feel that this game is deserving of my first review ever. I dont do pros and cons. I believe there is a little bit of something for everyone in this game. The combat is fluidish...i mean you have a sling and you have rocks and rocks hit head and make people dead. It can be a little difficult in the beginning with a basic sling but overtime as you upgrade it the combat is much more fluid. The story telling...well if you have read any other posts there is not much more to say. It is wonderful...a truly captivating experience. There is an incredible amount of growth by all the characters. There are so moments where i wanted to rp walk away and leave the kid behind. But overtime i grew fond of Hugo and Lucas (a character you meet in game). The attention to detail is impeccable. The graphics are breathtaking. The fact that this game runs so well on ultra with literally thousands of rats scurrying around on the floor without frame skips is a measure of how much the developers put into their craft. The puzzles are fun and not challenging...they more just add another layer of detail to an already detailed experience. \n\nOverall...i give this game an 8/10. I would have liked to see a little more combat maybe. But what they have here works. There is so much to enjoy. \n\nAlso...a horse explodes like a balloon at one point. Its pretty freaking awesome to watch.,Recommended
a very nice game with good mechanics,Recommended
"A very beautiful and emotional game. \nFrom the first moment I saw the fantastic visuals and even more impressive musical accompaniment (from Olivier Deriviere, also known for Vampyr, Get Even and Remember Me). The latter goes even that far that it dynamically aligns to the situations within the gameplay which intensifies the experience more through that.\nThe story itself is strongly told and emotionally engaging even if not all that innovative, if you're looking for that. Far from disposable or too predictable, though, it's still quite good for what it is. It reminded me a lot of The Last of Us in that regard, which was also not innovative but was very well carried through the relationship of the two main protagonists.\nThe Last of Us comes also to mind when you look at the gameplay itself: Sneaking, distracting and strangling enemies,  throwing stuff, crafting, running through mostly scripted escape sequences. Also you are quite vulnerable, even more so than in TLoU, as you die in one hit usually. And there is a greater unnatural threat hanging above all.\nSpeaking of which... \nThe name giving plague in form of countless rats, sometimes appearing like an all-devouring liquid, is also one of the many highlights in this game. From a technical and visual standpoint it's quite impressive, but also from an emotional and story-telling view. You can relate to this enormous threat thanks to the often cruel depiction of it and some desperate situations it shows or forces yourself in, what can leave you with a lump in your throat at some times. Really strong stuff there.\nWhat I'd like to point out is the nice integration of puzzles within the world itself and the subtle use of any immersion breaking HUD elements (can be turned off completely if preferred).\n\nBetween all the praise from my side, the game is not perfect of course.\nThe biggest issue for me was the weak - and sadly a bit immersion breaking - AI of the guards/enemies, what made the sneaking parts too easy most of the time. So don't expect anything like Metal Gear Solid or Thief there. Even TLoU was more challenging. On the bright side, A Plague Tale has fewer frustrating moments that would slow you down in your progression of the story. I didn't mind the low difficulty that much as I wanted to experience the story more than being challenged (there are already other games for that).\nApart from that there was also that last chunk of the game, maybe the last one or two chapters including the finale, which required a little bit too much trial and error. I guess it tried too hard to culminate most of the game mechanics to create a new challenge, but broke down in the process as these mechanics weren't build for such use, I felt.\n\nThe mentioned problems are still quite minor gripes within this great piece of art as a whole. \nI'm still in awe how much a comparably small team with a comparably small budget, a large amount of confidence for their product, while willing to take some risks, can accomplish if they focus (no pun intended) on the few things that really matter in a good game.\nHellblade as an example showed this also, with even less resources and more risk-taking. While it was the more innovative and probably more intense experience, I'd say A Plague Tale is the better [i]game[/i] as such. Not wanting to compromise any respect and appreciation I have for Hellblade and Ninja Theory. \nI'm deeply thankful for all the games of that manner - we need them desperately in such dreary times the (high budget) industry is in artistically right now.",Recommended

"This game got a story that will keep you interested and makes you want the game not to end so fast. I finished the game in 10 hours with 20/35 achievement, some people may call the story short but its just right for me. The combat in this game its not that hard, and you got more options for the combat through out the game. Atmosphere is F***ing amazing, each character is unique, voice acting is on point, graphics is top notch, the rats are disgusting, but cool!\n\nif you like Story rich games, this game is for you and its worth the price\nif you are not that into story rich game i would not suggest this game (Duh)",Recommended
I was really suprised by this game. The voice acting was absolutely excellent and really added to the realism of the setting. If you are looking for a single player story drivven game then this is for you. The gameplay isn't groundbreaking but is definately enough to not leave you hating it as there are a few different types of encounters you can have. Really happy I bought this game I'd recommend for those who aren't amazingly skilled at games or as an introduction to gaming.,Recommended
So far so good! amazing graphics and story wow. This game is a masterpiece!,Recommended
Great soundtrack and story.,Recommended
"I haven't finished the game, however, my experience so far with only approx 8.5 hours in-\n\nFirst impressions:\nThis game reminds me a lot of The Last of Us. There is some sort of plague going around, a lot of desolation, a lot of death, and the atmosphere just smells of doom and gloom. The graphics are great considering the engine and the budget for the game, the voice acting and the dialogue(I currently have it set to French voices with English subtitles, as the game takes place in France, however, there are English and German voices) is very immersive.\n\nPros: The game is challenging in some fresh, some not so fresh ways. It is a stealth-and-puzzle game, so if you're looking for ""Sew seck cawmbaht broooooo"", this isn't your speed. Go play Hitman or AC. The UI stays mostly out of the way, sometimes to a detriment, but I've never died due to the UI failing to show at a critical moment. The atmosphere is great. Is it amazing? No, but it's semi-realistic, given the subject matter. The Main character you play as is a young woman. She's not sexualized at all(kind of silly that has to be a Pro rather than an expectation for a story-driven game), but the game also doesn't shout ""Hey, we're being inclusive. Give us our brownie points for being inclusive, because that's why we did it."" The mechanics are reminiscent of the OG Thief in some ways, Splinter Cell in others, but none of it is layed on too thick. It has it's own style, it's own voice. I like that. The sound design is pretty great as well.\n\nCons: There are moments where the atmosphere doesn't translate well. (Avoiding light spoilers here, excuse the verbal tip-toeing)There is a visual element for representing a particular, yet, recurring danger, and while it comes off well at a distance, if you get close, or trigger some odd physics, you'll see the some blood from how the sausage was made, if you catch my meaning. It's not the greatest, and that does break immersion sometimes, at least for me, but it's not the end of the world. The gameplay mechanics get a little stale in some parts, also, there are materials for you to collect, and it doesn't exactly seem important as to why at first. But there are a lot, and if you don't pick them up when you should, you'll regret it later on. In my opinion, we shouldn't be introduced to resources we have no way of weighing their importance of until we know of their importance. They should just be left out of the equation altogether, like they do with other materials you'll get later in the game, but w/e. \n\nOverall: I'd recommend picking this up. I get a lot of satisfaction out of playing this game, and for someone who has trouble keeping their seat glued long enough to play for longer than a half-hour these days, this one has helped break that pattern. The story is engaging, the gameplay is challenging yet familiar enough, and it's not too hard on the eyes. So far, I'd rate this a ""Hell yeah!"" out of ""Should I buy this game?""",Recommended

"I've been hyped for this game for about a month now when I first saw an add for it, and I have enjoyed playing it a lot.\nBut I have a few Pros and Cons (If developers are reading this take it as constructive criticism, you made a really good game :D)\n\nPROS:\n-Great Graphics and details, looked beautiful.\n-Loved the characters.\n-Interesting Story.\n-Sets the mood very well.\n-The slingshot makes the game fun to play when you can choose to kill everyone or go stealth.\n\nCONS:\n-The voice actors were good, but AT TIMES they felt unenthusiastic which made me feel less immersed.\n-The dialog also AT TIMES didn't feel smooth, the characters were almost cutting each other of in mid sentence with an answere \n before the question/statement was asked/said.\n-The game ended very suddenly. It was last boss battle, then a zoom out, role credits, outro gameplay, done. At least for me I would have liked a more slow ending after the boss battle, where you feel sort of sad to see the characteres ''leave''.\n-More visible character expressions that fits their mood, sad/angry/happy exc.\n-Would like to know the charcters more, maybe more dialog between them as we are playing the game, looting exc.\n\n\nOPINION:\nI love these types of games that has a great story to tell. Don't be spooked by the big CONS list, these are only details that could help the game reach the next level, this is a great game to play and I don't regret buying it. I'm only trying to help you improve on other games in the future, maybe a sequal idk ;))",Recommended

"Utterly fantastic and thoroughly enjoyable. A great story, great characters and an interesting world. Great to see a stealth game with effort put in as well, and stealth that’s fun to play. Would love a sequel one day. \n\nThe only issues I ran into were a few frame drops, typically in the more built up areas, and that the controls could become quite the task later in the game, but nothing that ruined the experience.\n\nI recommend wholeheartedly.  \n",Recommended

This was a surprisingly well made game given the small developer.  The Graphics competed with current gen games and the story was longer than I expected.,Recommended
"This review is a bit all over the place but hopefully it gives you a good idea of why this game is so amazing. Every inch of this game was designed with care. From the nature vistas to the sprawling of the mutilated dead, it all has a purpose in a greater story. The game does not lay out the entirety of the lore neatly for you in text boxes hidden away in a menu like many other games, making you an omniscient compendium of knowledge, rather you know just as much as the character you play as. Your base of knowledge expands the same amount as Amicia's, making this game feel like a two hour movie expanded on through the medium of video game storytelling. The gameplay isn't particularly difficult, in fact towards the end, because I invested time into upgrades, I found myself somewhat cheesing different stealth segments with my slingshot. This is ok, however, because the gameplay is merely a necessary part to be considered a video game, the overall focus of the design space being on creating an immersive alternate history that rewards exploration while also funneling you through the narrative in a way that is engaging.",Recommended
"This game has beautiful graphics and and equally beautiful soundtrack. The story is engaging and easily followed. Game play is fun and rewarding. That said, it is not without issues, which the devs have fixes for in the forums.",Recommended
Fantastic from start to finish.,Recommended
"This is by far one of the best games I have played. I've had tears in my eyes for several times during the fantastic gameplay in a magical setting of France during the plague. A Plague Tale Innocence brings something new to the genre of story driven single player. You will have a slingshot with various functions depending on what needs to be done, stealth with a unique twist, a little brother capable of extaordinary things, beautiful graphics, and of course, a magnificent story to enjoy.\n\nIf you are a fan of Assassins Creed, Metal Gear Solid, The Last of Us, you are truly going to love this!",Recommended
Wonderful,Recommended
"Game is really enjoyable, nice story and gameplay, reminding Last of Us.\n\nGameplay time is about 9 hours I guess, if you go slowly and paying attention to the story.\n\nNPCs sometimes are really blind and dumb, but I guess the game focus more on the story than the difficult.\n\nStill a nice game for the budget! Recommended!",Recommended
"This game is not Skyrim or The Witcher. You are forced through a story, and there is little room to stray from that. Some players may dislike that, and that's okay, but I loved this game. A Plague Tale: Innocence is a primarily stealth-based game with a lovely story, interesting mechanics, and varied puzzles. I beat the game in 10 hours and am now going back through with the goal of getting every achievement. If what I've described sounds like it would be worth the price, enjoy. I recommend  players go in with few expectations, and let the game surprise you.",Recommended

"The biggest amazement to me before I start this review is that this game only scores 'very positive'.\n\nFor a completely new IP, a total departure for a developer more in line with 'popular' gaming tropes, Plague Tale is a beautiful, grimy, vile, yet astonishingly brilliant exploration through a dark time of the French middle ages.\n\nThe ideas here, mostly, are nothing new, but the way it's cobbled together on the murky cobbles of the French countryside really is borderline genius, and there is little I can criticise in the game beyond the odd bug and frame wobble.\n\nAs Amicia (and Hugo) you find yourselves plunged into a nightmare after the French Inquisition pursue you come hell or high water, and both are very much obstacles in this place.\n\nThe plot is brilliantly conceived with voice acting of the highest calibre - and the visuals are gruesomely brilliant while being genuinely stunning in the more sedate locations (of which there are few).\n\nAs a brand new release, it's a really impressive story, game, and despite being priced at AAA value for a game which isn't as long or big as any such titles, it's probably worth more than the majority of them put together.\n\nThe gameplay keeps it simple, and while there are a few frustrating sections with perhaps slightly unfair checkpoint placement, nevertheless it's unbelievably fun to play and fun to explore.\n\nIt's a story, a story conceived in blood and darkness, but from that horror rises a truly exceptional title which is as close to perfect as it's possible to get.\n\nThis is a definite contender for game of the year and manages to actually make us care about the characters, even the ones we don't like as much.\n\nA fine story, fine visuals, fine gameplay, oh and did I mention the sound and music are stunning?\n\nHighly recommended.",Recommended
"PROS:\n-Fantastic story, though predictable at times, it keeps you on the edge of your seat and engaged.\n-Beautiful, fluid soundtrack that works flawlessly with the game.\n-Great graphics that show every detail that needs to be shown perfectly.\n-Horrifyingly grusome and dark atmosphere that keeps your stomach churning DO NOT EAT WHILE PLAYING THIS GAME (Think Dead Space)\n\nCONS:\n-Freezes, crashes, stutters... Constantly.I dont know if it's just me (shouldn't be,) but chapter 12 in perticular was pretty much broken. But if it's doing this to an i5, RIP the person using the i3 that this game is supposed to work on.\n-The gameplay outside of the puzzles is painfully mediocre, the game itself plays a lot like The Last of Us.\n\nAfter just completing the game, I will say it was worth every penny of it's $45 price tag.",Recommended
"Awesome Game. Great Story, Gameplay, Graphics, Sound, Music. Fantastic Single Player Experience. Highly Recommended.",Recommended
A really good looking game! Highly recommended.,Recommended
This game is worth all the hype.,Recommended
"It takes a while to build up tempo, but when the story beats find their rythm, this little gem hits some narrative high notes that I haven't heard (sorry, had to keep the metaphor going) since the likes of The Last of Us or the latest God of War. While the gameplay is nothing to write home about, it's of sufficient complexity to make for some quite engaging stealth driven moments. Recommended!",Recommended

An amazing game!,Recommended
Great emotional story!,Recommended
"Great game, loved the story, the voice acting and the music. \nGraphics look great, only thing that I can nitpick is about the screen space shadows on objects disappearing when something like a stick occludes your vision of the object. It was kinda distracting in some instances but its very subtle most of the time and probably worth it performance-wise. \nThe rat swarms are not super realistic per-se, it is quite easy to see that they follow the same few patterns but seeing thousands of them on-screen had the same effect on me as watching a liquid simulation which I find really cool. The last boss battle was pretty intense in that regard and I loved it.\n",Recommended
"One of the best story driven games i played. I think the narrative and atmosphere are the best things about this game. \n 1. Story \n Story is engaging, fast paced and pretty long, characters are interesting and have all something special about them. The interactions between them reveal much about people and the world in general.  Sometimes though it can feel as if the plot is just about children fighting adults and society, so it gets slightly cliche. \n 2. Atmosphere \n Atmosphere is grim, dark and hopeless with a few bright moments mixed in. Just as it should be really. Level design fits perfectly with these plague themes, where streets are rotting ( and not only streets), famine is merciless and war destroys societies. \n3. Music \n I also consider music a very important part of this game, as the atmosphere would not be the same without it. I am putting it separately because it definitely deserves its own spot. It also somewhat reminiscent of real Medieval music, but is more tuned for the atmosphere of he game.\n4. Combat and stealth\n Lets say the are not the best. Stealth feels dull at times but is still interesting with all the possibilities you have. Combat is quite simple and straightforward, also being somewhat slow.\nI totally recommend it for the story and atmosphere that this game delivers.",Recommended
"A Plague Tale gradually descends into the horrors of war and medieval witch hunts, with a compelling story-driven adventure. \nAsobo studio masterfully uses light and color to build a beautifully ambivalent atmosphere. As you progress, you'll be alternatively struck by beautiful nature scenes, and traumatising visions of the Black Plague and the ravages of the Hundred Years' War.",Recommended
"10-12 hours is a bit short playthrough as for me, but story is really good, and you cant even say that it tooked you only that much of time. The major thing I can complain is animations, they are a bit poor, fortunately you can clearly mention they low quality only few times during the game.\n[9/10]",Recommended
"Despair, hopelessness the sense of abandonment, these are just a few emotions that you go through when playing this game. Set in France during the Black Plague, Amicia and her Brother Hugo just about lose everything when the Inquisition comes knocking to take away Hugo, \n\nTogether armed only with a slingshot Amicia and her brother escape the clutches of the Church however, not only do they have to avoid the Inquisition at cost lest they be killed but also endless hoards of Rats in this story of Survival.\n\nThe game story is Amazing the best written story in a game I've come across in a long time. Hugo a boy with an illness has been locked away by his Mother for a long time while finding a cure to his illness. The inquisition comes along and it pits you as Amicia a young girl tasked with caring for her ill brother while finding a cure to make him better. She does many things to keep her brother alive all while discovering an even deeper plot set by the Grand Inquisitor.\n\nThere are a few cons with the story despite how amazing it is, such as why is there family bloodline tainted. \n\nOverall I can overlook lack of background missing info because the story is so well done that it doesn't leave you asking that question until the end at least for me anyways.\n\nPros: \nAmazing Visuals Asobo Engine from the ground up looks better than Unreal Engine 4\nAsobo Studio may be small compared to Bethesda or other AAA game developers but proved can Rival quality \nRich Amazing story\n0 Performance loss with many Rats on screen\nCan kill as many Rats or soldiers however you see fit\nPuzzles are easy and quick\n\nCons:\nRats Rats Raaats and did I mention Rats?

No replayability unless you just want to go back for achievements, and the story could not be more linear with but one or two options in gameplay throughout the entire story.

"It's ridiculous. This game is so polished in every way, it's hard to put for me into words. And I haven't finished it yet.\n\nThe visuals are out of this world, making you stop multiple times to just appreciate the surroundings. Even small things that other games neglect because it might be a passage you spend only a few seconds in are deeply detailed in this game. Although sometimes it's a shame because the game makes you dash through those areas despite me wanting to have a calm look around. :)\n\nThe atmosphere is one of the key things the game does so much better than any game I had in a while. I have the luck to enjoy this game on a 4k TV with a nice 5.1 sound system. I am actually sinking into the world of the game and feeling myself in those forests, castles, dungeons or plague ridden villages. Also the music underlines the atmosphere, making heavy use of classical string instruments to enhance the feel of the era, and to put it in simple words: it sounds nice.\n\nThe characters and the interaction between them are deep and convincing, also greatly enhanced by the performance of the voice actors, especially Hugo, Amicia and Vitalis. THe animations, 3D models and faces look stunning.\n\nThe story is something we didn't have in a while, at least not this well carried out. The developement is slow but reaches now hights in every chapter, without going over the top and breaking the immersion.\n\nThe gameplay as the mechanics and controls is responsive and comprehensive. The worst example of responsivenes I can think of is The Witcher 3, where Gerald moves like an unmotivated rock. Amicia (and later other characters...) move swiftly and precise, without having weird animations. There is a nice crafting system that gets more extensive during the whole story but never gets too complicated. In fact there hasn't been a moment where the UI or that crafting system annoyed me.\n\nThe performance and optimization of this game is very good. I never ran into any crash or sever frame rate drops during the whole game in 4k and a severly overclocked system. Although I believe SSAO isn't the best choice for this game in my opinion but it does the job. \n\n\nI am not done with this game but felt the urge to write this review since early chapters because I was so enchanted by it. It's a must play single player experience and I am yet very excited for the remaining chapters. \n\nIf I had to pick a thing that annoyed me, the urge of there characters to give you hints if you don't find the solution to a situation right away. If you get to a spot where you have to break a chain or use a certain ammunition to lure a soldier away but fail to recognize this in a quick time the characters start giving hints. It's nice of them but happens so fast and frequently that it sometimes makes you feel stupid for not seeing a chain between hundrets of other things.\n\n\nWell, this got longer than expected. Overall it's a huge recommendation from my side and I hope we get to see more polished games like this from Asobo Studios!\n\n\n\nP.S. Amicia best girl.",Recommended

"When I first bought this, I was under the impression that the amount of enemies you killed could change the ending similarly to the dishonored games. However, this was not the case. This is a very linear game, more similar to The Last of us in a medieval setting, but I really enjoyed it even though I'm not usually into strictly linear games. The challenge the gameplay offers often comes down to how well you can observe your surroundings and how you can  analyse your environment. The plot is quite enjoyable and interesting + the kid, Hugo is the cutest NPC in a game ever.\n\nThe overarching theme of the game, is pretty much death and how the protagonist, Amicia, a teenage girl, can mentally grow to be able to deal with it, and also kill someone to protect herself and her brother, losing her innocence in the process, thus the latter part of the title.\n\nI would overall recommend it to anyone, since it's an easily digestible game and a really fun time, especially considering this is the developer's first game of this type.",Recommended
Love the way the game looks and the flow of the story. Would recommend.,Recommended
An incredible experience. If you love good stories and immersive games just buy it without hesitation.,Recommended
"Highly recommend!\n\n+ Characters (They are really well done, all of them!)\n+ Atmosphere\n+ Gameplay\n+ Storytelling\n+ Graphics\n+ Controls\n+ Sound\n\nAll in all I was very astonished how good this game had become. It will really suck you up with its dark tones and briliant characters.\n\n(Very) Minor flaws are:\n- Level Recylcing\n- Endboss (allthough thats not really a legit one)\n\nIt took me about 9 Hours to finish, and Id buy it again even it was only four. Thats how good it was.",Recommended

"Beautiful story, great graphics and satisfying game-play all come together in this game.\nDon't expect to play for hundreds of hours like it's Skyrim or The Witcher, but its length is decent and definitely worth the price.\nIf Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice left you wanting more, this game is for you.\nIf you don't know Hellblade yet, go check it out too.",Recommended
"A Plague Tale: Innocence is all about surviving in an odious and decadent medieval Aquitaine, using your wits. The gorgeous art design and taut, realistic writing make for a heart-wrenching juxtaposition to its rat-infested underbelly. Here is a very touching and lively relationship between brother and sister, a beautiful and atmospheric voice of heroes. With each chapter, you'll more and more want to know what will happen next, and i promise, about this journey you can not soon forget.",Recommended
"I don't really review games, but I felt I had to say something about this game because of how much I enjoyed it. I wasn't sure what to expect when I bought this as I knew nothing about the game and had never seen any of the trailers, but it hooked me quickly and it's become one of my favorite games I have played in a long time. Here is a quick list of my pros and cons.\n\nPros\n\n- The graphics and environments are great, and I believe this may be the best looking medieval setting I have ever seen in a game.\n\n- The characters are good, which is what I was most worried about when I bought the game. I was nervous especially that the child character, Hugo, would end up annoying me, but I was pleasantly surprised and he and the player character Amicia quickly grew on me.\n\n- The Story is interesting and kept me invested, wondering what would happen next. As soon as it finished, I was immediately wanting a sequel, which is a feeling I don't often get when I finish games.\n\n- The voice acting is excellent, especially from Amicia and Hugo.\n\n- The soundtrack is superb.\n\n- Story is really the focus here, but the gameplay is fun enough, though it is on the simple side. The game is very stealth heavy and you will often need to pay attention to your environment to get through certain areas. Finding collectibles is fun and I enjoy the looting and crafting mechanic. I also liked the rats, and wow are there a lot of rats.\n\n- I remember thinking at the beginning of the game how linear it felt. It seems that almost all games coming out these days have branching stories and wide open levels so I was initially turned off by how linear this game was, but that feeling went away rather quickly and I don't at all believe that the linearity is a bad thing in this game.\n\nCons\n\n- I experienced some light bugs mostly relating to the sling mechanics, the sling being your main tool and weapon, but they were rare and I never experienced any game breaking issues or crashes, though I have seen some people reporting that they did.\n\n- Characters following me would occasionally follow too far and get caught by the rats when if they were closer they would have been fine, though this only happened once or twice.\n\n- The game is on the short side, I was able to finish the story in just over nine hours. If you want to be a completionist and find all of the collectibles and achievements though I could see it taking up to 11 or so hours.\n\nConclusion\n\nI really enjoyed this game, and it may be my pick for GOTY assuming nothing else comes out and blows my mind by the end of the year. Great story, great visuals, great music, and great characters more than make up for the game's shortcomings and I really hope we see a continuation of this story in the future.",Recommended

"I'm only about half way through the game but the story line so far is amazing! I was excited for this game to come out originally and I was not disappointed! The graphics are beautiful, the story and characters draw you in and make it so you don't want to stop. Where five more minutes end up turning into an hour of playing.",Recommended
cool game!,Recommended
"A masterpiece. Dont even wait for a sale. Great characters, great story, great graphics, great emotional attachments to everyone, and great voice acting.",Recommended
"Got the game on sale well well worth my money. Starts out as a stealth game with puzzle elements, but in the later game you can pretty much just murder every person without really thinking about it. To me it made me enjoy the game so much more because ten hours of stealth and puzzles wouldn't be that enjoyable to me personally. The story is great keeps you invested wanting to see what happens next and the characters are enjoyable they could use a little more development, but for the most part they hit the mark. I highly recommend this game I'd even say it would be worth full price.",Recommended
5 Stars!,Recommended
"The game is definitely proof that story driven games haven't lost popularity in the gaming industry since it delivers beautiful graphics, a compelling story, and lovable characters.",Recommended
"Best game I've played in a long time comparable to The Last Of Us but, making it clear it's not just a copy and paste. Best game I've paid full price in a long time and I would have paid a full $60 but, this was sold at $45!",Recommended
I hate kids. I loved Hugo. So many feels.,Recommended
"I would recommend if for no other reason than to support story driven single player games.\n\nThe setting and story are pretty good, the main cast is well written and likable for the most part, with genuine heartfelt moments. The antagonists are mediocre. The combat is not the greatest. The graphics are pretty stunning and are only made better with the photo mode (great for screen archers like me). Standard graphics options, rather heavy on GPU at max settings (should be expected). My RTX 2080 hovered at around 63c during gameplay.\n\nOverall a solid game for any enthusiast of single player games.\n\n--MILD SPOILERS--\nIn an ideal world i would've liked the rats to remain scary and threatening all throughout the game. Perhaps a little more growth on the part of the villains. The reasoning for the inquisition is somewhat unclear (or i'm just an idiot). Personally i would've liked the disease to be the main threat and opposition.",Recommended
"Not what I was expecting in a very good way!\n\nSoundtrack and story is great. Progression and difficulty feels spot on. A good balance between action and puzzle solving. Only advice would be to learn how to use the hot keys for item selection to quickly switch during faster paced fights, not needed but it will help.",Recommended
Worth every penny! Beat it in one sitting took about 10 hours with no breaks.,Recommended
"I have played barely any of this game, I think, but it is phenomenal.  It isn't very combat heavy, but the small bits we get feel incredible.  This game is cinematic at it's heart and the developers hit the mark spot on.  The music is amazing for every situation, the lighting, the camera positioning even during gameplay!  I will admit I was hesitant at first to buy the game, but if you are looking for a game that has great story, great visuals and atmosphere, and very smooth gameplay that keeps you on your toes, this is it.",Recommended

"Most stealth games have a very deliberate setup of the positioning of the NPC's and various items in the world; unfortunately, this game design is very prevalent in this title.  That is the only flaw I see with this game.  The voice acting is well done, the puzzles are not overly frustrating, and the mouse and keyboard controls are perfect.  The only major omission from this game is that I cannot find Sean Bean; maybe he was eaten by rats before the prologue began.\n\nGill is dumb for not buying this game.",Recommended

"A truly well developed game , the story is by far one of the best experiences I’ve seen in my time as a gamer. I he environments truly represent the horror of a plague Infested kingdom. The hard choices you have to make for your loved ones are absolutely heartbreaking. \nThis is one of the games I would recommend to people who would like to be proven that games can be art.\nOh and not to forget the most important facts : it’s single player , it’s got no micro transactions , no lootboxes and no store exclusivity. It’s just you and your journey you will take in the game \nI would rate a plague tale a solid 9/10. The one point I have taken is because of some undetermined plot holes. But overall a fantastic story driven game. \n",Recommended
"The game offers a really good looking art/music style and a great window to the medieval France. The story is interesting so far, with good pace and characters designs; however, the gameplay does not reflect the story tension points and the puzzle/stealth sections are both too simple and repetitive. I wish I could feel the danger in those tense moments with the guards or the rats. Finally, there are some elements that really break the ""fantasy"" of the game world, like the satchel with rocks and the vases placed in inopportune places (almost everywhere when you need it - they also respawn if required!). Again, this is over simplify the gameplay that without tension and variety will drop the player's attention and interest eventually. Overall, it is a good experience with both pros and cons like I state above. I recommend it to people who can forgo the gameplay problems and enjoy the visual, sound, and story of the game.\n\n- Harbrus (Game Designer)",Recommended

A Plague Tale is an interesting take on well the plague. Frankly it does it right every hour I spent on it was spent mesmerized not only in the graphical beauty of the game but also on the story of two young children and there journey. The combat system is fun and satisfying while you are also able to elevate that combat system those with a more stealthy approach can choose to go down a path of stealth and silence. Overall a great story game while lacking in hours upon hours of gameplay it makes up for it with an action packed adventure and perspective changing silver linings.,Recommended
"A Plague Tale: Innocence is story-driven adventure game in which you follow the story of an orphaned teenage girl who has to escape with her sick younger brother amidst war and plague.\n \nRatings out of 10:\n\n+Graphics: 9\nGreat\n\n+Soundtracks: 7\nNothing too special, but then again it's not bad. It's just ok.\n\n+Story: 9.5\nThey basically nailed the story. Likewise, I really liked the psychological aspect of the game, I mean just look at Amicia's reaction when she gets her first kill. The only dsadvantage is that the story is somewhat short (takes 8-10 hours to complete)\n\n+Gameplay (Movement, Controls, etc.): 6.5\nThis is where the game experience falls short for me. I just didn't like the controls with the mouse and keyboard, they were so sluggish at times. I didn't try playing with a controller yet but I'm pretty sure it will be better.\n\nConclusion: 8/10\nDefinitely pick up this game if you enjoy a good story with a decent gameplay. Also, a controller is recommended.",Recommended
"This is one of those games that just engross you and you cannot stop playing it until it is finished. It does a great job of making you feel both relatively helpless against armor clad enemies but empowered when you get the tools to deal with them. Crafting equipment is basic and not too necessary but you will very much be crafting ammunition to use in different situations. The story is what sells this game, you get very attached to the characters and I loved every minute of it!",Recommended

I can easily give 8/10 to this game.",Recommended

While the gameplay leaves some desire for expansion, I found that my 12 hours in the game left me with the perfect amount of time dealing with the life of our protagonists.",Recommended

Mindblowing Story!,Recommended
"A Plague Tale: Innocence is a surprisingly well made\nand polished game, considering it is Asobo Studio's first\noriginal title since the, rather mediocre and poor racing game FUEL,\nback in 2008.\n\nThe story takes place in 1349 France and focuses on the story\nof Amicia, whom you'll be mostly playing as, and her little brother\nHugo, which due to his long term illness has been kept mostly isolated\nsince his early days.\n\nAfter a mysterious plague arriving and sweeping the lands followed\nby a swarm of rats and the arrival of a brutal Inquisition,\nyou find yourself alone with your estranged little brother\nand having to take care of him, while surviving in this seemingly\nprogressive dark and cold reality you find yourself in.\n\nVery beautiful graphics, by default maybe a too heavy\nlayer of post processing effects. Does not support SLi,\nbut runs pretty efficiently considering the graphical fidelity.\n\nGame mechanics works well, the sneaking aspect is ok, the\nenemies has a wide detection cone, but it is very forgiving, so\nsneaking isn't much of an challenge. You have to mainly use light\nto fend off the rat swarm, either carrying torches or set flamable\nobjects on fire. The game gives you new abilities and items\nevenly sprinkled over the duration of the game, helping you to\novercome new obsticals the game throws at you, and different\ncombinations of these can lead to varying tactics you can use\nto proceed to the next section of the game and kill enemies.\n\nYour little brother is not a annoying dumb AI in the game and does\nnot feel like a nuisance you have to drag around, because the\ndevelopers did the correct thing here of having your brother\nconstantly holding your hand, which makes him move WITH you\nrather than being an AI that follows you and get stuck.\n\nYou can tell him to stay where he is, if you want to venture\na short distance yourself, to either take down an enemy, explore\nor get to some items. If you go too far away from your brother tho,\nhe will get scared and start to panic. All of this makes him\nfeel really well implemented into the game, and your character\nstarts forming a Recommended sibling bond over the duration of the story.\n\nThe game is dark and eerie, at times it can go really dark\nand graphic and the game will at times make you do some\ncruel things.\n\nThe story is engaging, interesting and kept me wanting to know more.\nWell written story, the voice acting is reasonably good and at times great.\n\nIt took me about 11 hours to finish this game, and it felt like a fitting duration,\nnot too long nor too short.\n\nIt's a great game that I would recommend to people who liked\nBrothers: A Tale of Two Sons or The Last Of Us.",Recommended

The gameplay was fun, but also frustrating with the limited items; that isn't bad though. It gets pretty intense when all you have to fight with is a slingshot. The story was great, however I felt like some parts were lacking and some situations moved too fast. If the game was longer, I'm sure that wouldn't have been a problem. A shame that the game is pretty short.",Recommended

I really enjoyed this so far. Challenging enough to make me keep playing. I'd recommend to anyone.,Recommended
Early impressions are positive.,Recommended
"If there is one word to describe a Plague Tale it would be unsettling, and that's a good thing. You follow the story of Amicia and her little brother Hugo, which takes a grim turn as the inquisition destroys their home and tries to take Hugo. Amicia must do all she can to protect him whilst the inquisition continues their attempt to capture her little brother. This wouldn't be the most unsettling thing if there weren't a million demonic rats swarming every dark corner and crevice.\n\nThe main gameplay consists of avoiding guards using a sling to distract, bait, or kill guards in your path, and manipulating light to avoid getting devoured by rats. Whilst relatively linear the game does provide natural mechanic introductions and a few choices of approach.\n\nThe real meat of the game is the tragic tale that is Amicia's journey desperately trying to protect what remains of her old life. It is a relatively simple story but it is touching to see the familial bond between the siblings. Combined with the slick visuals and incredibly smooth lighting a Plague Tale becomes awesomely unsettling.",Recommended
The game has a nice story and atmosphere and the rats add a very cool mechanic. Overall I enjoyed playing it a lot.\nIf I had to point out one negative aspect that vould be the optimization of the game. At some points I had quite bad framedrops.,Recommended
First impression: It's beautiful. The truth is I wanted to buy this game from the first moment I've heard about it. Finally I did and I'm not disappointed. I enjoy every single minute I spend in this game. The graphics are amazing. The world around is beautiful. The story is great. The game also has a photo mode which allows you to take some really cool screenshots. Definitely recommend to buy at any price. It's worth it.,Recommended
"A Plague Tale: Innocence is probably the best game that has come out in 2019 thus far if you like story driven games.

If stealth games and puzzle games are your thing, by all means grab it. If not, might be a good idea to stay away.",Recommended
"Simply put, a masterpiece. A breathtaking story following well thought character's, a gameplay allowing for some great exploration of a beautiful world. All in all a masterpiece of a game.",Recommended

Though it was fine since it auto pauses itself if it does.\nI did find one run breaking oversight which I put into my screenshots and reported, but it is by no means gamebreaking or even required for a player to go to that spot. It's more of a ""whoops, that happened"" sceneario and can be fixed by dieing or restarting at checkpoint.\n\nOversight for Reference, In order to avoid it happening to you:\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/app/752590/discussions/1/1639789306549904939/",Recommended
"Sean Bean performing the poem definitely piqued my interest but I will say that I'm happy I gave this game a chance. The story is an interesting tale and the graphics are fantastic, making this game a visual masterpiece. With the descent into chaos and the dark atmosphere of a plague-infested, war-torn France of the middle ages, the landscape your adventure leads you through can be as unsettling as the game is beautiful. \n\nAll in all, I enjoyed the game. However, since the game was entirely story-driven, gameplay occasionally felt a bit lacking. It only took me a bit over 9 hours to finish the storyline and I don't see much replay value unless you're an achievement completionist. If you can get it on sale for around $30 or less, I would recommend picking it up",Recommended

"A fantastic game with the right blend of narrative and action and craft-based iventory.\nThis is a dramatisation of the Black Plague in France at a time when nobility ruled the lands and superstition ruled just as widely, and alchemy was a science. It deftly also explains the population decrease in a very dramatic scary way, the rise of the middle class (because so many people died) and how nobles were not spared because plague does not take social status or wealth into account. \n\nThe story surrounds two orphans who are bound by blood and bond. Through hardship and the hard choices of having to take lives to save them, and the lost of innocence by religious authorities gifted power through perceived divine right.\n\nThe game has the standard mechanics, and although its not as flexible in movement as Assassin's Creed, you still have to navigate every turn very carefully or die. Make use of your resources wisely to survive and look after one another. The graphics are quite stunning even on low quality and the environment although it is short and controlled, is till quite a sight. It does not tax your computer that much so for its graphics and the good game - it is a good buy.\n\nAmicia was quite relatable being a teenage girl in the Middle Ages trying to survive. Perhaps more relatable than most games of this type due to the fact she is not some middle aged white man. Hugo was understandably annoying. The game adequately invokes empathy to their complex relationship. My only qualm about this game is how short it was. I finished it in 2 days and got 35/35 of the achievements.",Recommended

It also has a lot of timely breaks where you\ncan just look at the trees, sky, have a little chat with Hugo and others... \n\nThe music and voice acting is also amazing.\n\nBut the game design is very linear and cumbersome.\nThere is no jump option, no stealth attack. In certain parts\nthere is only one way to move forward. Also a lot of the times, to pick up an object or open a door you have to have a very specific angle of looking at it and distance from it, otherwise the open button doesn't show.

(Outside of collecting collectible items in the world, there is no real replayability to the game.) \n[b]Is it fun?:[/b] Yes.\n\n[h1]Full Review:[/h1]\n\nA Plague Tale: Innocence is a great game trapped inside of an okay game. The year is 1348, our heroine is coming of age, and the world is on the brink of destruction due to the plague. Through a series of plot reasons, our hero must venture forth with her younger brother to safety in a grim and dark tale of mortality, morality, and family. Meeting interesting characters along the way through their journey they ultimately uncover the root of the plague and the nature of their family. \n\n[b]Story/Characters:[/b] The overall story is fantastic once the beginning of the game is established. Around thirty percent of the way through the game I got hooked into the plot and was eager to see how it solved itself. At points I was with bated breath and felt immersed in this world. The pace was excellent, and so was the dialogue. The world blended smoothly into cutscenes that carried the plot, each answer bringing new questions. The dialogue between characters had moments of laughter, tears, and terse anger. It flowed naturally and smoothly, though the character's animations and faces are quite uncanny valley. \n\n[b]Sounds:[/b] The soundtrack, especially the main song used in the title and world, is grim and wonderful. The sounds were bright and interesting or grim and terrifying. The distinctive shuffle of small feet across stone floors. The heavy step of a plate-armor clad knight marching through a courtyard. The wails of the diseased and forgotten. It all has appropriate sounds, and was really well done. \n\n[b]World:[/b] The world represented the tone of the game in a deft way. Cutscenes inbetween each chapter would dictate the pace/colors/world you encountered in the next chapter. There's a particularly extraordinarily well crafted scene early-game of our heroes venturing across a somber battlefield between French and English armies.. It was beyond impressive to see how well it was executed. Sadly, the scale and scope of that particular scene was the epitome of the game, yet each map and section had it's own unique characteristics that really were awe-inspiring. \n\n[b]Gameplay:[/b] This is where the game felt lacking. The controls were stiff, and vaguely clunky. One of the main grievances I had was that you could only vault with a button prompt, yet there's a delay before the prompt shows up. The vault hotkey is also the dodge hotkey, so instead of vaulting a wall, you'd dodge back only to have to trek back up to your initial point and wait for the slow prompt. There were other moments of gameplay that were outright tedious over natural and fun. This is where I began to notice other grievances within an otherwise deft story and world.\n\n[b]Combat:[/b] Outright awful in a lot of senses. Not only does it seem forced, it's not fun. With the pace of the game being more focused on surviving, evading, and escaping, it seemed to make more sense to just focus solely on stealth. Yet the game would force combat. With the use of her trusty weapon, our heroine dispatches numerous enemies. In terms of the story I get why our heroine had to kill people, but in terms of gameplay it felt forced. There's three major boss fights in the game, each one requiring unique mechanics with the aid of new combat/stealth abilities you've unlocked from other characters. The last fight being outright boring, as was the second. In a game built on stealth and evasion and puzzles it would have made more sense to double-down on the puzzles/stealth, and remove this combat system entirely. It just didn't fit. \n\n[b]Puzzles:[/b] The puzzles were fun, but almost comically easy. Three major puzzles stood out to me as super interesting, fun, and actually puzzling. The rest of the puzzles were very, very easy and not that fun. It was more of a chore than anything. Another task to complete to progress the story. Another puzzle. Another cluster of guards. Rinse, lather, repeat. \n\n[b]Is it fun/worth playing?[/b] \n\nYes. No. Maybe. It depends on you as a player. On my terms I can put aside gameplay for a great story and engaging world. Even with the tedium of this game, it never prohibited my enjoyment of the game's story and world. At most, it was an overcast sky on a beautiful beach. If you're a player that doesn't really care about story, characters, or world, this game could be passed and you wouldn't be missing much. A Plague Tale: Innocence has a lot of things going for it, and half the things it does, it executes perfectly and interestingly. Unfortunately, the other half are mediocre at best, and some are outright tedious. A Plague Tale: Innocence is a great game, trapped inside of an okay game. \n\n[h1]Overall: 7.5/10\nStory-heavy players:9/10\nGameplay focused players:6/10\nPrice I feel it's worth: $15[/h1]",Recommended
"Visually, the game is stunning. The initial previews I saw were the rat mechanics a while back and it sold me. However, the story is spotty. The characters -- Amicia and Hugo -- don't act like normal people. I get it, without conflict there would be no game. But their attitudes jump from calm and loving to I hate you, leave me alone within seconds. Amicia has shown herself to be a strong, smart, and resourceful hero, but doesn't realize where Hugo has gone -- even though her hallucinations have told her and she knows where her mom is. I enjoyed the game, but, again, parts of the story and the character building are spotty.\n\nTL;DR: Fun mechanics, gorgeous visuals, spotty story. Tomb Raider in the 1300's. 7/10",Recommended
"amazing game , interesting story  with a good gameplay mechanism",Recommended
"For those who play games for the stories or the characters, this is a must buy. Each of the characters, particularly the protagonist Amicia, come to life in incredible vivacity and color (due in huge part to the excellent voice-acting). The writers did an excellent job and this is such a heart-wrenching tale of loss and love that I want to play it over and over and over again. The ending does feel a bit sudden and almost has a hint of deus ex machina in it, but if you play through the first few chapters, you won't care how it ends as long as Hugo and Amicia are happy. \n\nA few quick pros and cons: \n\nPros: \n1. Killing feels WRONG. I hated killing guards so much I kept track of every person I killed voluntarily and involutarily. The game is deeply human. \n2. The npc's (guards and the like) sound great and little tidbits of conversation as you approach new obstacles enhances the atmosphere and fleshes the story out immensely. \n3. The entire game feels like a long puzzle. Even navigating troop infested barracks or woods laced with rats feels more like careful planning on which guards need to be killed at which precise moment and which should be left alive, etc. Even boss fights felt like a maze which had to be correctly navigated to reach the next checkpoint. I label this as a pro because it was very engaging mentally, but if you prefer mindless hacking over careful planning, you may want to choose a different game. \n4. The game has unparalleled graphics so that every scene I wanted to stop and take in everything I could see. \n\nCons: \n1. The game is railroaded, though I didn't mind at all, to my great surprise. You are here to become Amicia and help the writers tell the story through you. If you love great stories or just want to know the characters, that isn't an issue. \n2. I had issues with game crashes at the end, which meant I spent a whole week to finish one hour of gameplay. Lowering the graphics level helped some, but not completely.",Recommended

"This game is heavily inspired by ""The Last of Us"".\nI do not want spoil much about the story, so the only thing you need to know is it's about a relationship between two ""almost"" strangers. Further I think the story is not the strong suit of this game. It is more about the little things like how the journey is driven. There are beautiful landscapes in this game (if you there you do not want to leave) and always a nice soundtrack in the background to enjoy the ambient.\n\nIf you like what you see and what you heared about this game: Go for it!\nIf you are not certain: Wait for a sale.\n\nFinally I have to say this game is dark and gritty and for people who enjoy medieval themed games with many characters to care for. Notice: the combat is not the focus of this game!\n\nAnd almost forgot ...\nThanks Asobo Studio\n... for this wonderful experience.",Recommended
Very good. Buy it!,Recommended
"(Comments are enabled)\n\nA Plague Tale: Innocence is the best example of how Storydriven Singleplayer experiences are yet to fall and is just the one thing the game industry still requires. You can have all your gimmick games, your sidescroller jump-n-runs, your open worlds, your RPGs but nothing will ever reach the depth of a good story told via the gameplay and the world you find yourself playing in. And that is exactly what this game does.\n\nUnlike many games nowadays, it is not filled with extreme back to back combat or escape sequences on every level whatsover. It does have those, I wont lie to you, but they are spread out over multiple chapters and are not part of one singular chapter that covers this one gimmick and thats it. Instead it gives it to you as part of the overall stealth experience the game involves you in because you arent a top notch soldier, the chosen one or anything really important. No. You are the chosen ones sidekick and protector. (God dammit, my wish came finally Recommended!)\n\nYou are Amicia de Rune, a young french girl, sister to Hugo de Rune (an even younger french child) and you are tasked with protecting your little brother from the Plague that is ever present even when you are escaping the Knights of the Inquisition. And while this isnt the spanish inquisition despite the fact that they didnt expect them to come to their home, those guys are still hella dangerous. Lead by Lord Nicholas, they are out to get Hugo de Rune for whatever they have in store for him. And without spoiling it: It aint pretty.\n\nWhile you play through the chapters you will find yourself in various situations. Stealth being the biggest piece of the pie and combat taking up the smallest as you are to avoid it if possible. That doesnt mean that you cant fight your way through the enemies, though it is highly discouraged especially when running or just sneaking past is still an option. And for those curious: I did a mix of all three. But of course fighting and stealthing arent the only things that matter in this game.\n\nBecause there is still the plague which basically means : RATS ARE EVERYWHERE. But I hear you ask: ""Well its just rats? Whats the big deal?"" Well let me tell you, little Jimmy. Those rats are like a swarm of Piranhas that are out to feed on a fresh body that just fell into the river. Those little guys are not cute and make cute noises. They will bite off your nose if you just let them come a little close than you should. That and more actually.\n\nAnd how does the game manage to keep you going despite the swarms of rats? Through fire that you can create or just use in general. There are torches throughout the game, small campfires or lit braziers that you can light sticks on and even unlit torches and stands that you have to use small alchemical crafts on to light them up. And with that we have reached the Puzzle and ressourcemanagement part of the game. Yea you knew I would get there at some point. The good, the bad and the ""holy shit how do I get out of this situation, I dont have many stones left and there is an army coming towards me!"" part.\n\nSo crafting in this game can be done in two ways but for both you need the proper ingredients which you can gather throughout the game if you actually bother to look for them. Some are far more obvious than others and even I found myself to be at a point where I knew I must have missed something in an area I have yet to see. In other words: Second playthrough here I come!\n\nAs for the crafting itself however, its fairly easy. The first way to craft is on the fly. You get alchemical recipes throughout the chapters and have to use them to get through the chapter as a whole. You dont just learn one recipe for one chapter though as many of these items are used in many other situations throughout the entire game. The most important one however is the craft so that you can light flames from afar. And believe me, you will want to keep that stuff stockpiled or the rats are going to stock-PILE your bones. (Kill me)\n\nThe other side of crafting is at workbenches. What can you craft there? Well little Jimmy its nice that you ask but YOU SHOULD STOP INTERUPTING ME thanks because it isnt all that grand. While what you craft improves your overall gear and is certainly helpful overall, what you craft is only optional and can be ignored entirely if you want a more painful and difficult experience. You can craft better pockets, a sturdier sling, ways to improve your alchemical satchel and more. For what I would have to say: Its the standard we can expect from such a game. Which isnt a bad but neither good. Its just the standard.\n\nAll in all, A Plague Tale: Innocence definitely gets an A+ from me. There were some parts that I had difficulties with but overall I am willing to look past minor stuff when the overall experience was a pretty great one. As for those minor stuff: Please dont expect me to write them down. I do not want to begin to nitpick on small time issues you will likely not even experience yourself because I am a dumba- because I sometimes struggle with stealth.",Recommended

The game is longer than I expected a the premise twists into something pretty absurd. But then it takes it so far beyond that and it gets good again with silly boss battles.\n\nGreat graphics and soundtrack. Lots of nice one off animations.

"I just finished this game for the very first time, just 20 minutes ago. Being a fan of dishonored, skyrim, etc, I can say that this game gave me those types of vibes. This story-driven game boasts a great soundtrack, awesome SFX, breathtaking graphics, and an interesting story. The game uses the little things to immerse you into this world, and has a great and thrilling first few chapter to do just that. On the other hand, the stealth is very unrealistic, and the gameplay doesn't allow very much exploration or multiple ways to get things done, I always knew where I was supposed to go, usually all within sight, almost like a theme-park like game. With that said, I still actually truly enjoyed the stealth and gameplay moments. This game is also the perfect length in my opinion, and offers some re-playability with achievements & collectibles, although I know I won't bother with that. To those thinking about getting this game, it's truly an experience that I would recommend to anyone.",Recommended
"A Plague Tale: Innocence is a game I've been waiting for, for a long time! An immersive story driven single player experience, that has characters that I was totally invested in.

I will definitely go back in to collect the rest of the oddities. I really hope a sequel is in the works!\n\nThe only gripe I have with the game is in some cut scenes the character's faces seemed a bit awkward and devoid of emotion, especially in the really emotional parts. Saying that still, it didn't take away much from the experience at all.\n\nDefinitely worth the $45 or so. I completely recommend you playing this game!",Recommended

"[b] If you want a solid 10-hour story-driven game, Plague Tale: Innocence delivers. [/b]\n\n[b]PLOT & STORY[/b]\nThis is the best part of the game. Asobo studios has created a personal story around 2 main characters (Amicia and Hugo De Rune) while at the same time incorporating the events of the plague in 14th century Europe. You can feel the hopes and fears of the De Rune siblings as they try their best to find peace while they go through a somber atmosphere.\n\nThe supporting characters are also well done that they maintain their individuality while interacting with Amicia and Hugo.\n\n[b]GRAPHICS[/b]\nPlague Tale is one really good looking game. The characters, their clothing, lighting and environments all really add to the atmosphere created by Asobo. \n\nYou can check my video review at the bottom if you want to see what it's like (in ultrawide too). \n\n[b]GAMEPLAY[/b]\nThis part of the game is decent. The game is an interactive, stealth-based experience. It allows for some basic crafting and use of basic items to help you get through sequences and take down enemies. While it is linear, there is usually some other method you can use to get through sections of the game.\n\nWhile the developer could have added more in terms of variety, Asobo did enough so that it supports the fantastic narrative.\n\n[b]SUMMARY[/b]\nLike I said, it's a solid 10 hour experience.

"This game is one of the most emotional and amazing trips i have been trough. This game is like one of those books where you just have to read another chapter because you just can't put it down. At the same time you always want to put it down because you don't want it to be over.\n\nI highly recommend this game to anyone who likes an immersive story with a beautiful friendship with as much between a sister and a brother, who don't know each other even though they've been living under the same roof for their whole life. As well as the other friendships and emotional connections you get as you proceed in a rat infested France during the plague.\n\nThis is not an open world game as i thought from the beginning and it makes it even better. It's great writing, immersive story as well as emotional and beautiful.\n\nThis is absolutely one of the best games i have played in 2019! Do not hesitate. Just play it, it will be worth your while and money!",Recommended
"This game is a great example of quality over quantity. It makes me think of Hellblade Senua's Sacrifice; it's very linear, relatively short, with a good story and a strong female lead. It ran perfectly for me at 1080p on a middling GTX-1060 based PC. No frame drops, no bugs, no glitches. I'm amazed at this, considering that it's built on a bespoke game engine by a small studio. It's visually stunning and the soundtrack is gorgeous. For me, this was well worth the full asking price, as it's exactly the type of game I want to play and I like the old-school payment format. No micro-transactions here. The only negative for me was what I consider to be a strange decision from the devs to ship the game with a default blurring setting in the graphics, with no obvious way to turn it off. It's not motion blur, it's actual blurring around the periphery of the image. I cannot understand why they thought this looked good.

"A Plague Tale is a solid return to linear story games.  This is something that we don't seem to get enough of these days so this is a welcome release.    You'll make your way through the French countryside that has been plagued by infected rats while also avoiding a group of hostiles called the Templars that are after your family.  The game has a God of War (2018) feel to it as you're paired up with your brother and forced to work together to solve puzzles and sneak past enemies.  \n\nThe graphics are great to look at and while not spectacular - they're on par with what you'd expect from a AA development studio in 2019.  The environments are very detailed and I have stopped a few times to enjoy the scenery.  As stated before, the game is extremely linear with a few areas that allow for slightly altered paths.  Armed with only a sling(shot) and various ammunition that you discover along the way - combat is limited and the focus is placed more on stealth in this title.  You will make use of various crafting materials scattered about the world and that keeps progression interesting - think of the crafting bench method found in The Last of Us.\n\nMy only real complaint is how ""on the rails"" the game feels.  I enjoy a good linear story mode as much as the next guy and this game definitely accomplishes that.  However it leaves next to nothing to the imagination.  At every turn, there is only one solution to environmental puzzles that you come across and before you can even start to brainstorm as to what the solution could be - either your character or a character in your party will give you a very explicit hint such as ""look at that lever over there"" or ""look, you can destroy that lamp"".  As an avoid puzzle gamer, this bugs me - but it's only a small complaint.  \n\nPros:\n+Gripping, sad story\n+Strong character development\n+Fun combat and stealth mechanics that don't make you feel unrealistically overpowered\n+Good crafting system that encourages a bit of exploration\n+Solid graphics and environment design\n+Fun puzzles, but...(see Cons)\n\nCons:\n-Leaves little to the imagination when solving puzzles - characters will often immediately give explicit hints to solve them\n-Can feel too ""on the rails"" - even for a linear story game\n-Materials are a little too readily available - diminishing difficulty and resource management a bit",Recommended
"Well, I was not expecting this...! What a beautiful surprise :)\n\nThis is a game that easily joins the ones I'll remember fondly (the same way ""The Last of Us"" or ""Shadow of Colossus"" did).\nThe storytelling and the characters are top-notch (even side ones), the game is beautiful and the music matches the ambience so well. What an accomplishment! It is not a challenging game, but  the pleasure comes from these little moments of well written dialogues and the discovery of gorgeous environments.\n\nI'll be sure to look at the next production from that studio. Thanks for making this, people of Asobo!",Recommended

"First, i do recommend this game. Its really damn good. BUT, the last like....15% of the game, was incredibly frustrating and the story turned really, really stupid. like, went from a 10/10 to about a 6.5.",Recommended
"Great game, everything is good, never get any issue/problem.\n\nBut why amicia can't use sword?",Recommended
"this is an awesome game\nbut it physically hurts\nit has made me cry because it becomes so frustrating at points.\nThe history in the game doesn't follow through, however, and will make you /rage/ near the end of the game. but other than that, it is beautifully developed and a lovely story line.\nIt just makes you rage so hard.",Recommended
Worth it just for the rat tech alone.,Recommended
"As I'm getting closer to the end of this game, I can already feel my heart breaking. I knew this game is going to be awesome but I didn't realize that it will go beyond my expectations.

"Amazing Game.. Gameplay is linear but the story, music and voice acting are superb.\nOne of the best games I've played in a long time! It may not have the skill requirements or puzzle solving difficulty of some other games but the atmosphere it creates and the emotions it evokes on the journey you will take with Amecia are well worth it and you won't miss these elements at all.. you'll almost be glad because as a result of not having these difficulties you can focus on the story and the characters.\n\nAs others have mentioned, it is relatively short in this day and age of games like Odyssey but the price reflects that and it's not so short that you will feel you didn't have a chance to experience the game.\n\nBuy it and support more games like this where story, acting and characters matter. You won't regret this one bit!",Recommended
Great game with a great story that delivered chills many times. Definitely worth a buy,Recommended
A very well made game with a good story and I only ever ran into one bug which easily fixed itself after I died to it haha. A downside is I wish the story was longer since it costs £40 but the story was really good but Im not complaining but I think that's just me not wanting the story to end because of how much I grew attached to the two main characters. I loved the gameplay mechanics but I wish the game was a little more more challenging.,Recommended
Very interesting story and concept. Amazing visuals. Alright gameplay. Great characters and talented voice actors. Spent 14h completing the game with all secrets and achievements done.,Recommended
"This game is very good. I consider it to be a stealth puzzle game where you can solve things in more than one way. The amount of emotion conveyed when the main character kills someone for the first time is tragic but realistic. The voice acting is overall very good. I did die a lot, but I got through most of the game without looking up walkthroughs. I loved this game because of the meaningful interactions of the characters.",Recommended

"This game is awesome,period!\nStory,atmosphere,music.And it runs on an awesome custom-built engine that looks great without any DXR(DX12 features),yes,I am looking at you-NVIDIA, Asobo are the guys you should be learning from,because they deliver. Reflections, lighting, performance, shadows and atmosphere are perfect and life-like.\nThe Asobo developers did a great job on the game and it feels like they put a lot of heart and soul into its creation.As for the engine that they built the game on-it really is the future of gaming as we see it without any additional bells and whistles.\nBe prepared the game is harsh,beautiful,emotional and some boss fights are hard.\nStealth can be clunky sometimes think scripted Splinter Cell,Thief,Deus Ex. \nOverall the emotional dialogues, story and the atmosphere on a well done engine and art think Skyrim and Witcher 3 provide an awesome must-have experience.Support the Asobo developers and buy this title!\n10/10",Recommended

With its gripping tale, great graphics, charming characters and solid gameplay mechanics, the game is a must-have for those who like single-player games with a strong focus on story and character development. It brings a really good balance between narrative design and game design. It's definitely among the gaming surprises of 2019, exceeding expectations in the best possible ways.",Recommended
"Beautiful game with a captivating story-line and guided game play. The voice acting for Amicia was amazing and makes it hard to believe her VA is new. The game does get quite dark, but definitely worth the investment if you're curious. 100% recommend to get-it for anyone who is on the fence. Hope they release more sequels/ spin offs in the future.",Recommended

"One of the best single player campaign games I have played in 2019. Despite having a simple and straight forward approach to the actual mechanics like weapon selection/utility, the game really makes use of a strong narrative to keep the player engaged.

The addition of some amazing music composition to compliment the game is fantastic and really gives you the feels of the different situations in the game.",Recommended
This is a awesome game,Recommended
"Falls a little bit short right at the end but make no mistake, this a beautiful game. I couldn't help feeling like I had just finished one of my favourite books as soon as the game ended; it is a weird feeling of the satisfaction and the acomplishment but also a bit melancholy about finishing it, like loosing a friend.

A+++++++++++++Highly Recommended!,Recommended
"   This game was breathtaking. It is visually stunning, the soundtrack is incredible, and it had so much heart. The game play consists of stealth mechanics and puzzle solving. You constantly get new abilities/items to keep things fresh and exciting. The voice acting and sound design were great, but the soundtrack stole the show in that regard.\n\n   The level design was fantastic, it nudged you along and gave clues without you realizing half the time. Levels were linear but still let you explore and find different solutions to many puzzles. The art design was phenomenal. So many times you start a chapter or enter a new space and are just awestruck by the environments.\n\n   On top of this all, the story was great. Very compelling, and the characters were likable. I even ended up liking the 5 year old, which is a feat in and of itself. The atmosphere and tone is very dark and tense but this is broken up by some really endearing moments. For a team of 45 people, on their first big release, color me very impressed. Can't wait for more.",Recommended
"Amazing game with brilliant graphics, gameplay, mechanics and unique uses of the environment in order to survive and use stealth.\n\nThe game had a brilliant story, based on plague events but took a strange, 'magic' turn.

"One of the greatest single-player story-driven games I've ever had a privilege of experiencing.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1747667890\n\nGraphically, this game is unmatched. I don't think I've seen any other game come close to the beauty that is contained within the world of A Plague Tale. The attention to detail is simply astonishing.\n\nAside from the game looking amazing, it also plays amazingly too. The gameplay is simplistic in terms of stealth, think HITMAN and the combat, while limited is a whole lot of fun. I love the variations of items you can use with your sling to defeat your enemies, all of which are heavily armoured knights with cold hard steel. You'd think this would make your chances of survival slim but combining a Bart Simpson-esque weapon with alchemy works incredibly well and I personally found it to never get boring, it's incredibly satisfying when you hear the crunch of a rock hitting a soldiers head.\n\nStory wise, again, this is a game in which you need to play if you're a fan of story-driven narratives. It has it's moments conveying every emotion. Moments in which you'll remember for a long time to come, you'll grow attached to characters and have hopes and fears for each and every one of them. Which I believe is something truly special in the world of video games.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1747667937\n\nWhen doing reviews, I try my hardest to name both positives and negatives but I'm finding myself stumped when it comes to thinking up cons for this game. I guess if I had to nitpick, I'd say there's only 2 real things that annoyed me in any way.\n\n• No native Ultrawide support. (This can be fixed via hex editor.)\n• My game crashed twice on chapter 13 or 14 (whichever one let me play as Hugo.)\n\nAside from these 2 minuscule annoyances, there really isn't anything else negative I can say.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1748449989\n\nTL;DR:\n[b]A Plague Tale: Innocence is a visually superior beautiful story-driven work of art that's both fun and heart wrenching, it's worthy of any award it's nominated for and I really hope that the developers that made this game, make another on par with this game or surpassing it in every way imaginable. While that doesn't seem fathomable because of the sheer amount of hard work that went into this, I can always dream in the hope that it will happen. [u]10/10[/u][/b]",Recommended
"WauW, what a journey this been.\n\nIf one were to descripe this as 'The Last of Us' in the middle-ages, I would have gone for it sooner !\nCan recommend for any who appreciate a good story, great voice acting and immersive gameplay.",Recommended
"Great game, can't believe it went under my radar.  I found out about this game from the Youtuber Penguinz0 and after just seeing a min of the gameplay I bought it. I loved the minimalist hud and the story. The final boss also was cool. I hope there is a sequel.",Recommended
"Really, this is a story driven game, the narRATive is strong and the game is linear which makes it enjoyable. There is a bit of stealth and bit of combat; the violence that exists, does not feel gRATuitous it was sufficiently in modeRATion.  There were a few bugs ocassionally but they were minor and I would not beRATe anyone for that.   \n\nAs you explore the environments, the game has optional items that you can find with accompanying historical liteRATure. I took my time with exploRATion of all areas.  The environment felt illustRATive of that period of time.  Though I'm no expert, it does feel accuRATe or at least is inspired by depictions from the 1300s.\n\nThrough and through, the characters make the story and in this one, each person met felt well written, with their own stories and motivations.  The game does a good job of getting you to coopeRATe with them. Although from the trailers you may think it's a bunch of bRATs, you will in fact find that they are all pleasant, and nobody gRATes in an annoying way. \n\nSummarizing, although calling it the greatest game of 2019 would be an exaggeRATion, I don't think it's irRATional to consider it in the top 10 at least.",Recommended
"9 Hours story, but it was nice. I didn't try going into every corner for every collectible.\nGame features minor puzzle and lots of stealth elements. \nI felt like the main focus of the game was to get you more emotionally engaged/attached rather than deliver a superb story. \n\nThere's lots of AAA Titles that constantly fail to deliver, not with this one. Even though it was a quick 9 Hours, it felt like watching a movie that I could finish in one whole day. For somebody who only has free time on a weekend to spend, it is a much appreciated factor.",Recommended

"[h1] A Visionary Masterpiece of Heart and Horror [/h1] \n\n[i] ""When the stars threw down their spears, \nAnd watered heaven with their tears, \nDid he smile his work to see?"" \n- The Tyger; William Blake [/i] \n\nWe've all heard the old hypothetical.. if you could pick one super power, what would it be? My answer has always been the same; time travel. Primarily so I could witness all the times and places we can only read about. Shakespeare's Henry V sparked my interest in The Hundred Years' War at an early age, and further fueled by tales of Jeanne d'Arc and her Marechal, the infamous Gilles De Rais, later known as Bluebeard. These stories fire the imagination of a time filled with blood and ash, ignoble death in the mud, homicidal religious fervor and brigandry, wholesale slaughter in the name of a god... abject horrors in a world of madness akin to a Boschian Hell that we can scarcely imagine today. \n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1752768592 \n\nRarely have I been so immersed in a game's historical setting. The last time was with Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice. A Plague Tale: Innocence is certainly in a league with Hellblade, the highest praise I can give. It is a masterpiece of engaging writing, memorable characters, and a convincing game world, all rendered with a brilliant engine created by Asobo Studio. Every square inch of this game is saturated with a realistically grim atmosphere and lavished with dark details that immerse you in its world; 14th century France, war torn, ravaged by plague and the insanity of the Inquisition. Though I wouldn't want to live in 14th century France, A game like this allows us to witness some part of it from a safe and secure perspective, lest we forget, ensconced in our comfy chairs. May we be reminded how far we have come since that age, and yet.. how we still have far to go in the dispelling of those archaic delusions that lead to the murder of so many innocent lives. \n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1754217793  \n\nMinor gripes; the mostly optional ""Press F to look"" camera control often overlapped with immediate impending danger, with the controls not returning to the player until.. well, until too late. The primary stealth mechanic of the game is simple and functional, but often required a bit of expirementing before getting it right, making for the occasional ""learn by dying"" that I find somewhat irritating since it takes me mentally out of the game. At that point I am not role playing as the game character any longer, but simply a gamer trying to beat the game. \n\nI have heard some detractors of the game calling it a ""victim game"", like Hellblade, but I don't think that is necessarily a bad thing. Perhaps we need more titles told from the perspective of genuine human suffering and less of the teenagers-with-superpowers fodder that is blanketing all forms of media today from movies to games. Suffering is the beginning of wisdom, and the best way to learn Recommended humility and compassion, even if experienced only vicariously through the context of a video game. The fact that it causes some to resent the game, rather than feeling edified by it, says a lot about the state of the world and its youth today. \n\nAll in all, it is well worth the full asking price. Longer than expected for such an artistic achievement, it doesn't overstay its welcome either. I cannot recommend it highly enough, especially to those gaming history nerds out there like me. In a world of cookie cutter games that seem phoned-in, Asobo Studio has crafted something sorely lacking in the industry today: a game with heart. To paraphrase Frost, they have taken the road less traveled, and it has made all the difference. \n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1769773738\n\n*For anyone interested, I made a ReShade preset for the game, called [url=https://sfx.thelazy.net/games/preset/10558/] Innocence Lost [/url]",Recommended
"This is a game more about the overall experience and story than the raw gameplay - and that's fine. It's not a ""walking simulator"" but the gameplay is simplistic and slightly rigid. However the game can be rewarding and engaging when you actually have the option to engage with a scenario in multiple ways, which is rarely as the game often wants you to approach situations in very specific ways.\n\nThis is one of the most beautiful games I've played in a long while. The environments are very pretty and atmospheric and there's a great variety to the locations you'll visit throughout the 10-14 hours it takes to complete this adventure. The levels themselves were a big part of why I enjoyed this game. All the visual splendor is a accompanied by a suitably atmospheric soundtrack that sets a perfect mood at all times.\n\nThe story and characters kept me engaged and I always wanted to see what was coming next. The characters are well voiced with convincing performances most of the time with very few exceptions.\n\nThe rats in this game are something special. A very well realized mechanic throughout the game that keeps things interesting.\n\nOverall an easy game to recommend if you're into a good adventure. I have a fair few nitpicks when it comes to this game, but ultimately they don't ruin an otherwise very well made, story driven game.",Recommended
"This is probably the only game I will ever review, but I felt as if this is the one that deserves it.\nIf you're into linear story, albeit a bit short, then you will be kicking yourself in the ass if you don't give this one a try. Well worth the $40. I give 11/10",Recommended

"Story-wise this an incredible single player story, one that's more than worth the $44.99. The story is gripping, a few moments of the third act felt tiring, but overall it was well told. \n\nThe story wouldn't have been possible with out every incredible character throughout the game. The characters were all well written, well voice acted, each had their own story that fit well into the game, and most importantly you felt and rooted for each and every protagonist of the game. The antagonists were also well done, and easily one of my most hated villains in awhile. \n\nThe soundtrack on this game was so well done as well. It fit the time period, the mood, and the emotional story perfectly, and was definitely one of the highest points in the game.\n\nGraphically this game was beautiful. There's a lot of different environments here, and each was as stunning as the last. From beautiful nature settings, to grim and bleak lands scorned by the rat plague. \n\nThe gameplay mechanics was also well done. The stealth aspect didn't feel too hard, yet challenging, it makes you think about your actions. Having other characters you feel responsible for adds to the pressure and intensity throughout the game. The crafting and looting elements were also well done, and didn't feel distracting at all.\n\nThe only real critiques I have here is generally the third act of the story. Overall most of the game is incredible, especially the story, but just a few moments towards the end felt a bit tiring, and I felt that the ending could've left on a stronger note, though I was in the end satisfied with everything that happened.\n\nIf you're seeking a brand new single player, story driven game, then look no further.",Recommended
"Just finished the game at 8.5 hours. Starts off intense, has a little lull about 2/3 through the story where the story gets a little dull (setting up for the end). The chapters (I think 2 of them) got a little repetitive in this section. Other than that the game was excellent. It picks up even more for the ending. Stick it through, the game is super worth it. \n\nBeautiful game, compelling story, and unique gameplay that evolves with progression gave me a great ride. I cried.",Recommended
"[b] I was instantly taken with this game [/b] from the first trailer I watched long before it released. I don't preorder games very often, but I did with A Plague Tale: Innocence and I didn't regret it.\n\nA Plague Tale: Innocence is a wonderful narrative experience with an incredible and original story. Amicia, Hugo, and all of the characters they meet along this incredible journey are well written, likable, and voiced with perfect emotional weight, especially little Hugo.\nThe France of this world is gorgeous; the peaceful countrysides, the infested towns, the tunnels crawling with rats, and the towering cathedral are all beautiful and well done with small details to help build the story and make the world feel wonderfully lived in. While the experience is mostly linear, I enjoyed exploring the little corners for crafting materials, hidden collectibles, and just spots of dialogue with little Hugo and the friends you make. And everything is enhanced by an amazing soundtrack and ambiance.\nThe gameplay was incredibly enjoyable, though somewhat frustrating during the later part of the game (I will admit that it was very late when I was playing that part, and had little problem with it once I'd gotten some sleep). The puzzles are fun and very few are the same. I actually enjoyed the stealth gameplay, which is usually a huge obstacle for me in video games.\n\nStarting at $44.99, I definitely recommend buying this game at full price.\nI would love to see a sequel to this game, whether a direct one or just another story within this amazing world that they've built. With a title like ""A Plague Tale"", here's hoping.",Recommended

"Very atmospheric. Can't say anything, but good about this game. Absolutely loved it.\n\nOverall: 9/10\n\nGraphics: 8/10 - While the game looked quite good, they could have put slightly more time into faces.\n\nAudio (Sounds and music): 9/10 - They absolutely nailed it with music. Occasional violin sounds were too loud, but no biggie.\n\nGameplay: 9/10 - Much variation to gameplay, so did not feel bored at any point of time. Some checkpoints were at ridiculous places though, like a checkpoint before a room of loot and crafting table after which there was an area of potential failure. Meaning that when you messed up at the area of possible failure, the game took you back to before looting the area and crafting any upgrades. So each and every time you had to do this over again, which caused some time loss due to pointless repetitive activities, due to incorrect checkpoint placement.",Recommended
"You might know A Plague Tale: Innocence as “the game with all the rats,” and that’s not an unfair description.\n\nBut the game is much more than that. It is an epic story that keeps evolving until the very end, with intricate environmental puzzles that challenge you every step of the way, alongside some admittedly rudimentary stealth and combat.\n\nThe disease-ridden rodents are an omnipresent threat, but they aren't really an enemy you need to defeat - they are more like a game-long environmental puzzle that continuously ramps up the challenge.\n\nThe fun part is using these rats against the Inquisition soldiers that are hunting you. Douse a guard’s torch, and the rats will swarm him almost immediately, leaving behind a bloody skeleton. On the other hand, you can follow a patrolling guard and use his light to make it past the sea of rats. The two systems work well together and expand your toolset for dealing with both threats.\n\nStealth is pretty basic, and so is combat. Both aren't very imaginative, and can slightly undermine the game’s impact, but never to a degree where they hurt the experience in any way.\n\nIf you’re not deathly afraid of rats, you have no real excuse not to play this game. For those of you who are – A Plague Tale is a must.\n\nFull review: https://www.gamerspack.com/2019/05/26/a-plague-tale-innocence-review/",Recommended

"If your looking for a narrative driven game with some infiltration-based gameplay. This is one of the nicest titles in the genre I've played for a long time.\n\nNarrative is really strong and, while weak, the 2 main characters never become annoying. Instead the relation between Amicia and her brother is a pleasure to watch evolve as the story unfolds. All of this served by an impeccable voice over performance, both in English and French (I have not tried other languages).\n\nOn the graphics side, environments are wonderful and every level has a very strong identity and the game itself never feels old.\n\nI'm really happy of the 15 hours or so I've passed with this game and I can't wait for the next game this studio comes up with.",Recommended

The stealth system meshes very well with the story line. The graphics are stunning and it comes at a very respectable price point of 50 dollars with tax and is worth every penny and more. I highly recommend this to anyone that loves single player campaigns. If you're thinking of pulling the trigger, do it, you wont regret it.",Recommended
"I was incredibly excited for this game when it was announced - a dark, stealth-based game surrounding an incredibly dark period of our history was fascinating to me. There are aspects to the game that i feel were done very well, but the overall experience was lacking.\n\nTechnically speaking, the game struggles at points. The camera has a tendency to whip around wildly for no apparent reason and no amount of fiddling with the sensitivity seems to help. Frames drop fairly frequently as well despite freeing up all available resources on the machine and lowering graphic settings in an attempt to accommodate. \n\nThe animations of the characters faces also leave something to be desired, given the frequency of close-ups during cut scenes, the emotions seem utterly absent, combine that with incredibly lively VA and it results in a strange and robotic expression on the part of the characters. \n\nThe rats are interesting at first, but given the way the developers spoke on the subject I had expected something different, I guess.  It's evident where patterns begin to emerge, and the models of the rats clip through virtually everything which tends to break the immersion of the moment. This is less apparent later when the action ramps up, but that's a different subject entirely.\n\nSpeaking on game play, the crafting system was awkward at times and became more of a annoyance than a facet of the game. On one occasion I ran into a situation where I couldn't progress until I had replayed and died in the same area enough times that the guard dropped the one craftable I needed. Not to mention that crafting consumables used up materials necessary for upgrades, which greatly reduced the ability to upgrade my equipment throughout. Given how linear the game tended to be, it was bizarre for that to be the complexity in the situation.\n\nThe linear nature of the game also presented some frustration for me, in many parts, it was obvious where I was supposed to go next, but then at times the instructions seemed so absurdly unclear that I found myself dying over and over and over again for seemingly no good reason. Chapter 16 was incredibly frustrating for this reason. The instructions appeared very clear on the surface, but quickly they began to include concepts that seemed to be there for the sole reason of making the player listen to this NPC speak the same line repeatedly until the weight of the situation was lost on me entirely.\n\nIn trying to avoid spoilers, all I will say about the last portions of the game is that the final confrontation was poorly conceived, poorly conveyed, and even had I not had to repeat it numerous times due to technical issues (aiming too early resulted in shots firing off into the void) the story involved was disappointing and did not seem to answer any questions about the plot up to that point in any way whatsoever. You will play through the first half of the game with one idea of what the plot is, play through the second half with that having almost entirely being changed on the fly, and in the end you have as many, if not more, questions than you did in the very beginning. In fact, without the mystery of the situation which was present in the beginning, the game loses much of its' appeal and the characters, relationships, plot hooks, and events lose virtually all of their intrigue.\n\nIt feels like the game also set itself up for a sequel, which unfortunately I find to be a gross disservice to this game. Where this could have been tied up, and everything situated in itself, it leaves so much open with no feeling of actual completion. It feels incomplete. \n\nThe game was very promising, and perhaps still could be with some adjustments. Though, I feel the overall plot somewhat betrays what this game could have been, with some technical changes and with some changes to the ending, perhaps it could be saved. But in its' current state, at full price, it fails to meet the mark for me.",Not Recommended
"So...\n\n+ nice graphic\n- veeeeery short\n- boring\n- it can be too hard... for 6 year old, mayby\n- linear to the bone\n- useless inventory & crafting system\n\n2/10 - crap and waste of time.",Not Recommended
"The story, the story telling, voice acting and atmosphere is absolutly worth it!\nYou visit a lot of remarkable locations along the journey. And the reaction of the protagonists are great.\nAlso the story has some twists to it and this keeps it engaging.\nYou can overhear some conversations of enemies and I felt sometimes almost sympathetic to their motivation, especially the normal grunts who are also in this mess or the fanatical Inquisition.\nOh and the rats, oh the rats! This is just such a good gameplay mechanic and the story around the plague and the rats is terrifying. It starts of slowly but steadily and gets more and more momentum. There is foreshadowing and rumours considering the plague and the rats and it gets worse and worse.\n\nThe gameplay is OK to good. It is not too hard, but not all gameplay elements are thought out: The dodge mechanic I only used for one boss fight at the beginning of the game and never really used it afterwards. Also the boss fights take away from the normal stealth gameplay. And they are not very well explained, the last one was a lot of trial and error, because you deal with a situation you never encountered before and it was so different from the normal stealth gameplay. Other than that, it was a good choice that Amicia dies instantly with one hit. YOu have to stealth and tkae your enviroment into account.\nI am on the fence if it would be a little bit better, if the areas were a bit more open and you could tackle the situations in different ways. But than the atmosphere and storytelling could be hampered.\n\nOverall this game is one of the best games I played this year. And it left a lasting impression on me. The last game with an emphasis on story that did this was Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice. I think both are equally good and that says a lot about A Plague Tale.\nAlso the fact that I want to continue the story in this world after the end speaks for itself.",Recommended

I'll recommend this to everyone looking for game with a good story. You don't get many historical fiction games where you play very vulnerable characters.

"It's not easy to rate this game. \n\nDo you guys know that feeling when you experience something new, and you feel like it is bound for greatness, but it doesn't quite live up to its potential? Well, this is how I feel about this game. It's good, and I recommend it, but I feel like it could have been a masterpiece. \n\nTo start out this review, I'll point out what I liked about the game: It's refreshing. You usually play all those action-stealth type of games where you always have the option to ""out-muscle"" things in order to win. This game is different, you're a teen girl running around with her little brother, you aren't expected to challenge knights in plate armor, you need to play around them to progress (admittedly, you usually end up slaughtering them anyway, it just feels like you need to ""think"" more). \n\nYou aren't given recycled content, you're given a world that has problems that I've not yet seen explored in other games. It actually made me read quite a bit about the history of the black death, and I like the way it was implemented in this game. Sadly, I felt like this part isn't fully explored here. A plague is ravaging the land yet you do not truly feel the world suffer from it. I felt like more lore was needed... Maybe if you were given the option to talk to civilians, hear them talking about how they lost their loved ones, or read journal entries or hidden messages... You don't get any of that, which to me, was disappointing.\n\nAs for the gameplay itself, i'd say it's just OK. It's sophisticated enough to make you feel challenged and easy enough to not feel frustrated. The puzzles are very straightforward, and if you're stuck you'll always get a hint. I would have liked to see more stealth or combat options, because you usually do the stuff over and over again.\n\nThe game itself is very well optimized, it runs very well, and it has numerous graphic options such as resolution scale to make you squeeze the most performance out of your card. So if you're looking for a game that runs well on both low and high-end systems. this is the game for you. I've played 2018 titles that had much inferior graphics yet had much more serious FPS drops on my 1080ti setup. \n     \nTo sum it up, I'm Not sure if this game is for everyone. The scores are very high for this game, maybe too high. This game deserves your time because it's something new and creative.",Recommended
"One of the best games I have played in a while. Good graphics, great music & voice acting. Linear & a little easy at points, thanks to some slightly wonky AI, but not too much to pull you out of the game. Not too much downtime in the story, as it takes you through some good ups & downs.\n\nReally hope this becomes a full series of games & stories, as the world & its characters are very interesting & engrossing.",Recommended
"We need more high quality Double A titles with refreshing concepts like this. Not everything needs to be 50+ hours long (though this game has a surprisingly good length for its type) or online. Sometimes all people need is a unique, focused and enthralling game with a good story. The combat, puzzles and stealth are a bit basic and sometimes wonky, but it still managed to be mostly engaging and sometimes very tense (with some of the rat sections). The haunting soundtrack is also one of the best aspects of the game. The game is linear but still manages to put in a good amount of collectibles for completionists. Overall the game is better than the sum of it's parts, thanks in no small part to its beautiful art direction and macabre atmosphere. It's a somewhat flawed but still highly satisfying game. \n\nEasy recommend for those who are not turned off by linear experiences.",Recommended

"TLDR: Game is too short for $45 usd, Graphics can have an improvement, Engaging for the first two hours then makes you wonder if refund still possible, Story is cliched and would be absolutely orgasmic if they told it in longer then 12hours. \nLook at the bottom of the review for a game I recommend with better Story, Graphics, Gameplay, and Soundtrack. For less then half the price of this one. ($20usd)\n\nFor Reference I stopped playing at the part where you have to carry hugo - Yes by the bridge. (I'm assuming for the first time? If there is more later in the game.)\n\nFrom the reviews this game takes 12 hours or less to complete, For the price of $45 usd, That is not worth it imo.\n\nThe characters..... Could have a visual improvement, I've seen better textures from skyrim mods.\n\nI will admit the story and gameplay is rather engaging - Especially at the start, However Things for me started to fall off after the rats came. At that point you unlock the power to kill people, Giving someone this power in a stealth based game is simply too strong and I suggest to not use it at all whenever liable (If you can get through scene without upgrading sling would be nice aswell. A Recommended non-kill playthrough) So I go through and start killing people, Rather easily I will add. There is no stealth challenge for killing someone, Good games to point this out would be the Styx series in which you have to hold the button for 3-5 seconds to stealth kill - This game you just fire and keep walking, The death scream range is rather short.\n\nA nice tidbit I found out where the special animations for hugo and emelia death (Great voice acting - Best part of the game really alongside the soundtrack.) \n\nComments talk about puzzles, In my time playing I haven't encountered any ""Puzzles"" It's just move this here move that there and shoot this - It's too simple for even a child. \n\nI don't write reviews much, But I expected this game to alot more engaging and have alot more time into it for the steep price of $45 usd. \n\nIf you are one of those people who hate to watch others play games (Like me, Whole reason I bought this.) Then I would suggest to either give in and watch someone stream (Hope you can find someone who shuts up and just plays the game.) OR wait until this goes on sale. $30 usd would still be pricey but still buyable - I'd say this game is more worth $20-$25 usd. \n\nSince I am done writing this review, I am off to refund this game. Really hope it goes on a 50% sale soon, Maybe they might give it away on humble bundle? Even though I like to experience a game myself, For now I will just settle on watching people stream it. Can't wait to kill hugo and emelia again, It is rather funny on the swinging chandelier part. It clears away the rats so you can see the animation clearly.\n\nNow if you read down until the end let me recommend you a game that is worth less then half the price of this - But with better gameplay, Story, Graphics, and soundtrack (This game has a alright soundtrack, It's not bad) That would have to be.....\n\nOri and the Blind Forest Definitive Edition (Since original is no longer available, Same price though they just added more visual elements = More Flair.)",Not Recommended

"Just completed the game and it was amazing. \n\nThe Positives:\n- Really nice story\n- Gameplay\n- The mechanics \n- Lovely to see something difference that the typical games. \n\nThe negatives are few:\n- Kinda linear, but nice for a change\n- Very little replay value, as it will just be the same (unless you missed some achivements)\n- I wish there was more history to the main ""subject"" and the end.\n\nI can only recomment this gem of a game for anyone that can leave the typical openworld, 1000 skills, Battle Royal and so on games...\n",Recommended
Relaxing story with right percent of mystic and boss fights.,Recommended
"Every once in a while, a truly special gem of a game comes out of the blue and turns out to be a memorable experience. This is one of them.\n\nIn short, it’s this is a third person stealth-action game set in 1349 France amidst an English invasion, the Inquisition a Black Plague more mysterious and deadly than was ever seen before and some Alchemy. It focuses on the narrative and characters, with some stealth and action, horror themes, puzzle solving and action set pieces some of which are very epic. It’s mostly a linear adventure that relies on character building and the unravelling of the story’s mysteries. I found that the pace is well done, not dragged out nor too fast – I finished the game within a satisfying 12h.\n\nThe first thing that’s immediately apparent is how stunning the visuals are. The game is absolutely gorgeous, with high fidelity visuals, effects and an engrossing ambient – 1349 medieval France brought life by the rich and varied environments. It’s not all technical, though, along the journey you encounter truly breathtaking and diverse settings very well built and detailed, ranging from prosaic like a simple farm to impressive like castles and cathedrals to more dark and grim ones... Without spoiling, there’s some truly memorable sequences in memorable places to experience. The ambient sounds and soundtrack are also very good, further giving life to the environments and storytelling. The voice acting and dialogues I found good too, especially since the character Hugo is a 5y old boy.\n\nI think that the combat and stealth are very well done given that you mostly play with a 15y old girl armed with a sling and rocks – it kept things “realistically” menacing, grounded and engaging, and it worked surprising well in the absence of the usual swords and bows. You’ll start by simply being able to stay out of the guards’ way or distracting them, but you’ll keep getting new “abilities” which keep the stealth and combat sections fresh and engaging throughout the game. The rats part is a new original mechanic that is very interesting and further deepens the sense of danger and engrossing in the game’s world. \n\nAnd how amazing is it that they managed to meld so well the gameplay mechanics and the main characters with the 1349 France setting with such themes as the Inquisition, the Plague and Alchemy?\n\nEven the relationship between the characters is well developed and very touching, I felt it was not unlike “The Last of Us” and is especially good considering the main characters are a 15y old girl and a 5y old boy. Though it’s a linear game, there’s little touches here and there where characters notice things in the environment and small moments arise from them, giving them much character and life. These include some optional ones that you may encounter and that even though they don’t play a huge part overall, they leave a noticeable impact on your experience.\n\nAll in all, this is a very good game, with a good story, endearing characters, an original setting, gorgeous to look at, and that provides a memorable experience. It won a place in my heart.\n\nAlso, not being 60€ is a nice bonus too, since I think it’s worth that considering all the quality it has and the amazing experience It provides.\nThank you for all the people who made this wonderful game!",Recommended
"Gorgeous visuals, acting, and music. The overall plot unravels a bit the more it leans toward fantasy, but the character interactions within remain strong throughout. The stealth/combat mechanics are surprisingly deep for such a narrative-driven game, but the difficulty towards the end results in too many deaths, breaking up the flow of the story. \n\nOverall however, absolutely worth picking up for those interested in story and worldbuilding. If that is less of your thing, I would still recommend getting it on sale if you're interested in stealth and beautiful environments.",Recommended
Asobo Studios pulled a winner. The best money you can spend is with A Plague Tale. Stunning grapfics and good mechanics. But where the game shines is with its actual gameplay and story line. You`ll be amazed and wondered with this world. Enjoy. Have fun.,Recommended
"Tbh i goddamn love this game.\nI bought it, after having played through another similar Masterpiece ( In my opinion ) Hellblade: Senuas Sacrifice, since this game seemed like a similar experience.\nAnd yes, it is quite similar in the sense that the Story is very rich, the Combat is technically not needed but also doesnt feel forced and is quite well developed for such a simple system.\nThe problem is, i only finished the 3-5 hour Story( Yes that is really short for the price i know) AFTER 3 WEEKS.\nThis wasnt because it was hard or anything, but because the GODDAMN RATS DESTROY YOUR FUCKING CPU.\nI literally looked at the Ceiling for 50% of the gameplay so my PC didnt have to render any rats, which made the gameframes drop to 1fpm or something.\nI have now come back ( there only was the boss left ) and they had fixed the problem.\nSo I prepared myself for another 5-10 hours of heartwarming gameplay. Then the Credits rolled. After aproxximately 4 hours of gameplay that werent lagged into existence like the other 2.\nSo: would i reccomend this Game? Yes i really reccomend this game...BUT only if its a sale.\nIf you want a Interesting Story that has Puzzles and Combat thrown in, that is a bit cheaper i would most definetly point at Hellblade instead, since the total time you get out of your money is just worth a little more.\nBut if you really jus want this specific Story in your Game Library, by all means this game is a must buy.",Recommended
An excellent story-driven game. Beautiful graphics and simple crafting system. Play can be quite linear but never feels staid. A truly standout game among the more common genres.,Recommended

"Brilliant storytelling!\nThe characters control dynamics could be a bit smoother, but overall great entertainment.",Recommended
"The graphics are cool, so is the voice acting. The story and the atmosphere seem captivating.\n\nBut the game play is really meh. You run through hallway-like locations, then you crawl through hallway-like locations and finally you make your way through rat swarms in, again, hallway-like locations. Then the cycle starts all over again now in a completely new corridor but with the same old enemirs. And that is it. That's the only thing you do in this game. I guess it would've been okay if its price had been two times lower.",Not Recommended
"A beautifully written story and a beautiful game visually. I'm so glad to see the amount of positivity this game is receiving, because it truly is worth it. If you enjoy medieval, story based games, then it's worth every penny.",Recommended
"It been a long time since i've felt such joy playing a single player game. The art work, narrative and character development are just on another level to many games that have come out, especially when you consider it has roughly 15 hours playtime in it. All in all A Plague Tale Innocence is a short but sweet experience that left me excited for the next one.\n\nOnly downside was the voice acting, though this is mainly aimed at the younger children which you have to give some slack too in the first place because.... well because they are kids",Recommended
"One of the most captivating games I've played in while. Really great story, good characters, great setting, and it looks amazing too. Some of the mechanics can get repetitive towards the end but there wasn't one second where I regretted picking this game up. Awesome game.",Recommended

"The story is ok, the voice acting is sub-par, The graphics are GORGEOUS, but the music...\n\nAt first., I wasn't interested in the relationship between the two characters. It felt awkward when they started to become close. The only thing that sold it for me was the soundtrack that played when they had those emotional moments in the first third of the game.\n\nAs I kept playing, the scores kept getting better and better. This is a game that I think most will enjoy just for the music. The graphics are very stunning and some of the levels are atmospheric af. The fever dream in the third act is probably my favorite part of the game.\n\nI highly recommend anyone/everyone experience this game. It is a solid OK. The story's simple and I wouldn't call it a great game, but the soundtrack is amazing and I wish they had it on sale as dlc.",Recommended
"I quite enjoyed the game. I have read that some players have gotten it free. Good for you guys.. not so much for me. I bought the game and I found it a bit pricey for such a short game. Amazing game, should definitely be played but I personally would've loved it if it was longer and if we possibly could've customized the castle and truly make it a home/ base of operations.. before we had to flee it. I feel like that would've given us some extra play time/side quests.. kept us a bit busy could've gathered (more like gone looking for) mats to I dunno fix the courtyard or something... and having to flee afterwards after putting in all that work would've still been okay because it would feel real. Also would've loved to play the ending a bit more. If we could've maybe seen them set up their lives after the chaos a bit.. maybe even find and customize a new castle to live in that Hugo was talking about.. well you get the point. Just my 2 cents. Thank you for a great game. I truly did enjoy it while it lasted. Loved the artwork and the music as well. Well done and thank you to everyone who has worked on this. I hope to see sequels in the future. Will most certainly buy and play them.\nPosted 7 June.",Recommended

"A Plague Tale: Innocence, is one of the best games I have played in a while. The difficulty was balanced so you could pay close attention to the story as a lot of dialogue happens while actually playing the game. You learn a lot about Hugo, Amecia's younger brother and the turmoil his sister has to deal with in a hopeless world. As you travel through the world you gain new companions who help you get through the world and support one another, all with their own story and a common goal. The atmosphere is incredible and the music really is great and adds to the tension in a world with very brief periods of relief and happiness. I really recommend this game as it is a great story, one that I will remember. I think there will be a sequel but I will leave that up to you to find out for yourself. I know it will be great, I cant wait! :)",Recommended
"buy the game already\nEdit: finished the game, it only gets better! 10/10",Recommended
"Awesome, very original story. AAA visuals through out. Perfect balance and blend of cinematic quality story telling, puzzles and action. The characters come alive with the dialog and animation. Two thumbs up!!",Recommended
"A must-play for fans of story-driven single player experiences. I played on 2k resolution and it was stunning. Textures were impeccable (looking at you, metal armor), and the lighting was superb. Whoever the lead rat engineer was knocked it out of the park as well. Very few rat glitches and if they get stuck, they just sort of puff into sparks, which I think adds to the overall slightly-supernatural vibe. \n\nI tried listening to the game in french for some time with english subs (game is set in 14th century France), but I found that it was more distracting than anything. The voice actors and actresses all did a superb job, so I let the english speakers do their thing and didn't break any immersion or anything. \n\nAnd the music! I know a few people will turn music off on most games for the sake of immersion, but I HIGHLY advise against this, as the music adds so much depth and shock to everything, happy or sad, in this game. It's perfectly scored, and the musicians did a great job conveying the chaos of rat swarms. \n\nTook me 10 and a half hours to complete, and there's not much deviation or replay-ability, unless you do a second run for all the collectables. By no means an open world, if that's what you're looking for. But there are multiple ways to solve a good amount of the puzzles, especially late game.\n\nThis will go down as a favorite game of mine, most certainly of this year. The only qualm I have is that there were only a couple different enemy models, so you come across the same guy that you just killed 30 seconds later talking to a buddy. If that's where they had to make cuts to increase the polish (and there is a LOT of polish), than I approve whole-heartedly.\n\nAs of June, this is my game of the year. Great job, Asobo. 10/10",Recommended
"The game play is not hard but the beautiful music and a beautiful story makes me highly recommend this game...

"I don't recommend this game unless there's a DEEP sale. \n\nIt's way too short for what you pay.\n\nThe game is not the dark, gritty, realistic depiction of survival during the plague that it's advertised as. Very soon after the first few chapters, the tone shifts to that of an absurd high fantasy, and the ending is so insane it's laughable. This is the biggest reason I feel cheated. This is not mentioned in ANY of the trailers, yet it makes up the entire second half of the game. If this game was upfront that the whole second half is a magic fantasy, I wouldn't have bought it.\n\nThe interesting parts of this game are just left as loose ends. Everything that it makes you think about towards the middle is just thrown out the window, and everything contradicts itself. It's embarrassing.\n\nThe puzzles in this game are Skyrim-tier; they aren't challenging at all. The stealth aspect pitched at the start of the game gets thrown out the window, because you get pretty OP pretty quickly. The trailers say 'Amicia is a child and direct confrontation is futile, use your surroundings etc.' - bah. This felt like a shooter after the very early game. You don't even have to be clever about it, because you soon get an OP debuff that makes any enemy vulnerable.\n\nI can count on one hand the number of challenging situations in this game, and there's no difficulty slider. You have to deliberately change your play style and avoid certain items if you want to make the game more challenging. And the few challenges I faced weren't difficulties - they were annoyances. I wasn't challenged by a great game - I was annoyed by bad game design.\n\nIt looks great, I guess. It doesn't run particularly well, I struggled to get a locked 60FPS even at 1080p medium settings on a GTX 1060, which is higher than the recommended GPU. Even after tweaking the game to disable things like Ray-Traced shadows, it didn't yield. I also got a bunch of weird texture glitches, which was pretty distracting.\n\nI feel cheated by this game. It sold me what I thought was promising, but it turned out to be something completely different. And I'm not eligible for a refund because by the time the game gets really stupid, you're 4 hours into it.",Not Recommended

Wonderfull game with a wonderfull story.\nThe characters in this game are very believable and I really felt and lived with them.\nThe character progression itself is nice aswell. They get build up slowly and the relationship between the two main protogonists gets stronger and more emotional.\n\nGameplay wise I find the game good aswell. I heard some complaints about the stealth here and there but for me it was the right amount of it for this game.\n\nI enjoyed every minute of it and now I am hoping for a second part :),Recommended
This game sure has quiet a good story to tell and to play of course. I sure can only recommend it to all of you who are up to a good story telling game with accompanying fascinating graphic and music.,Recommended
Great game that manages to keep the story interesting and the game play simple but not boring.,Recommended
I do not think I have seen such good reviews for such a linear no choices graphics are meh 2015? I turned it up to 190% on ultra and meh. Seriously there is no reason to replay... I did  but I just wanted to sear into my brain what I remembered for 2015. I have to admit the story was very well done. Can't wait for the movie!,Not Recommended
"I don't usually write a lot of reviews for games, mainly because I got too many to play and I don't have time to try 'em all. One day....one day!\n\nAnyways, I thought I'd give my personal reView of ""A Plague Tale: Innocence"".\n\nHere is a game that I've been keen on playing ever since I first saw the trailer all those years ago. I relished and cherished every minute of it and even though I've already finished the game, a part of me wishes there was more to play.\n\nThe bond between the two characters reminds me of that between the two brothers in ""Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons"". Both games deals with loss and friendship but also about protecting the ones you love.\n\nIn fact, I wish I could re-experience the whole game over again and enjoy it just like the first time. But alas, I am happy with this game and what I experienced.\n\nDefinitely worth experiencing for yourself!\n\nSomething tells me this isn't the end of Amicia and Hugos' travels...",Recommended

"A very very good game. I liked the story, the many different typs of fighting with and against the rats. But sometimes the K.I is a bit stupid and for example in the boss fight something happens but wherent there were it ended. If that makes sense. I dont want to spoil. Thats why i described. I recommend this game, people who likes story games, old settings (century), a bit of thinking about what you gonna do. And in some sceanrios you should have strong nervers, i dont have em ;) .",Recommended
This game was amazing I enjoyed everything about it the graphics are just beautiful the story of the game is really well done some parts make u happy then some parts just make u sad,Recommended
"I read some reviews before I bought this game and some say its a little to simple and even \nrepetitive at some point. I dont agree with this, I played it 8h and its a good game that i will play again some time.",Recommended
"It is hard for me to rate this game with the limited binary steam system of ""up/down"", at the limit I opted to say I do not recommend this game because I do not recommend it at full price but I would at a discount.\n\nThe good: \nThe game is absolutely gorgeous, the graphics are beautiful and its an enjoyment to stop and enjoy the scenery. The story is also interesting and will progresses nicely throughout the game, the relationship Amicia and Hugo develop during the game can often make you smile (sometimes a sad smile)\n\nThe bad:\nAlthough sometimes the game shines by using children and their views to project their vision of the world this is lost when the game turns (almost) all of them into deranged psychopaths. This is not a choice you have, you can be a raging muderhobo or you can be a psychopath if you try hard... that is the only choices - you will be forced to kill people in cold blood if you want to progress, sometimes people that are already disabled and pose no threat. It doesn't suit the loving sister.\n\nThe ugly:\nWell for me the gameplay is just boring. The game is very linear, the whole experience while gorgeous is constantly on rails, the game will force you to go trough designated paths, every time a puzzle shows up it will have an obvious solution, when the puzzle requires materials the solution is even more obvious because the developers will place the exact materials you need to solve the puzzle right in front of your nose. There is never an achievement of solving anything because the developers decided to make the game so linear. The final bosses are another disappointment with basically figuring out the weakness (takes a death or two) and then exploit it mercilessly - again you come out of the game with a sense that you achieved nothing by killing these monsters. \n\nIt is a nice story but one that ends quickly (less than 10 hours) with little thought or skill required from the player. It has no replayability value either so my recommendation is staying away from paying 45 euros for this and wait until it is on sale.",Not Recommended
Wow... just play it.,Recommended
"Might be a bit on the pricey side but I really enjoyed this story.\n\nIt's not open world, It's a linear story driven game and only takes about 13 hours to 100%. \nIt's probably best to get it on sale but I for one am ok with paying the price for a good story.",Recommended
"I really enjoyed this game. It features a truly unique and inspired plot, wonderful characters, and fantastic atmosphere. The game played flawlessly without a single bug. Everything about this game was beautifully polished and detailed. Highly recommend.",Recommended
"A complete hidden gem. This game was an absolute pleasure to play through. Yes it is only 10-12 hours depending on play style but it does so by delivering quality over quantity. \n\nThe game is not ""hard"". There are a few quick-fingered movements. Near the end it does have an increase in difficulty that was a little unexpected. But it wasn't too hard to overcome with a little perseverance \n\nPick up this game for sure. If anything, to show support for good single-player experiences devoid of multiple cash-grab DLCs and microtransactions (there is a DLC, yes, but that seems to be given to anyone who buys)",Recommended
Loved this!,Recommended
"This game doesn't have too much replayability. However I don't think that is a bad thing. This is an experience. I have never cried as much and gotten so scared of little baby Hugo, oh my sweet beautiful Hugo, how I love you <3 I really got into the character and the story, despite cheesy in certain places, truly nails the desperation and terror of the setting, even when Amicia is at her bravest. The ending is truly something that needs to be experienced.\nThis game is great, and I can't recommend it enough, not even the somewhat basic controls and mechanics is enough to spoil how good the story is and how great the character of Hugo is used in this game. When was the last time you cared about an escort mission?",Recommended
"So this game is definitely a gem. Focus Home Interactive is almost notorious as Bethesda for releasing buggy games. I was very skeptical about buying another game from Focus Home Interactive since every game I own or played from this publisher is either buggy, garbage, or buggy garbage. This game though... is actually pretty good. \n\nThis game is sort of a ""walking simulator,"" where those games are focused on the story rather than the gameplay. This game manages to throw much more gameplay into it and a lot less walking. The gameplay is kind of a stealth puzzler but the stealth is pretty dull, at least for 2/3 of the game which is a real shame since at the last 1/3 you have access to numerous little medieval gadgets and doohickeys that you can really experiment with what you have. Overall, I still had a pretty good time and it has a pretty good story.",Recommended

Oh, was I so wrong ...\n\nIf you read this review, do yourself a favor: Don't watch any of the videos, ignore the images, actually ignore everything you might find online. Buy the game, tell your family you're busy and call in sick for a few days. If you bite fingernails, now might be the time to tape them.\n\nAlso, get a pen and a piece of paper. Every time the game makes you say ""WTF"" you mark it down. I guarantee you, once you're finished, there will be graffiti all over the table because you couldn't take your bloody eyes off the screen ...",Recommended
"Catchy story, moving and attaching characters, every single of them! Fantastic scenery, actually spooky at some parts! Wait for sales if you can/want but even at this price you won't be disappointed!

This game is amazing...the VERY VERY emotional roller coaster ride of this tale of brother and sister is what i always want to see a game have. story to me is everything in a game and to me this game was like playing a book that id read. i found my self so engrossed with this story that id have dreams and nightmares of being in the protagonists shoes almost like a bleeding effect from assassins creed modern story. But anyway more games should do this more dev teams need to take a look at what this game has done and replicate it.  also the music to this game is amazing at setting the tone of scenes and the emotion for the whole game.,Recommended
"Last game to make me feel this way was Hellblade. Especially the opening scene when Amicia finds her dog in the forest.  Its a great story driven game with its game mechanics on point. It will take a decently powerful PC setup to run this game maxed out at 4K 50 to 60fps. With that being said, having graphic settings maxed out rewards you with a stunning masterpiece. Far beyond PS4pro and XBONEx.\nThe voice acting and scripts are top notch! This really puts you in an emotional grip with the characters. Unfortunately the game doesn't last that long but its well worth the experience. \nI definitely say ""buy this damn game!""",Recommended
"Buy it during a sale if you can, it's not that it's bad but just after completing the game I'm like 70/30 \n\nI finished it in 9 hrs and I was playing pretty casually doing a bit of exploring now and then\n\nGot the game hoping it would fuuuuuuck me up emotional like Last of Us, but it was more 'aw what a lil cutie' \n\nWhile playing through the game I quite enjoyed every aspect of it. but at the end after the boss fight I saw the end credits and I was Sooooooooo annoyed with that ending, but LUCKILY there's an extra chapter after the credits just to lightly tie things up so make sure to play that extra chapter just so you feel somewhat content with the ending",Recommended

"MOSTLY SPOILER FREE\n\nA Plague Tale: Innocence is an adventure game set in 1300's France, during the outbreak of the Bubonic Plague. In the game you play as the brave big sister Amicia del Rune who is forced to protect and safeguard her sickly little brother Hugo del Rune, as horriffic circumstances takes everything she holds dear from her. Now you, the player, must brave difficult challenges, dangerous adversaries and hellish landscapes so that you can uncover the dark truth behind the plague. \n\nSounds nice doesn't it. \n\nI was deeply intrigued by ""A Plague Tale: Innocence"" when i first discovered the game. As a huge history nerd, a game set in the darkest period of human history intriqued me. It was simply too good to ignore and only for the low price of 44.99€... So i saddled up in my filthy gaming chair and prepared myself to be blown back, with an amazing story, characters full of emotion & amazing graphics that could really bring the plague to life. Sadly my expectations was not met, and here is why.\n\nSTORY:\nWhile the story is certainly dark and depressing, it doesn't really do much to surprise you in any sense that will leave you wondering what comes next. I can refer it to any 2nd rate tv series, as it is possible to call out what is going to happen to our characters in the future. Typical examples that you will encounter could be; ""Our heroes run from enemies and there is a river. I wonder if they will jump into it as a last resort?"" or the typical ""Oh no the bad guy wasn't dead after all"" cliche. (Keep in mind this review is spoiler free (or is it) so these aren't spoilers) Clichees like this drastically made me lose interest in the overall story as all realism faded away in favor of our characters progressing from A to B. \n\nCHARACTERS: \nWhile cute and loveable, most of the characters are as bland as any 2nd rate tv series you'll find out there. By bland i refer to them having a single character trait which defines them, and the fact that the only people you ever travel with is children. Hypothetical examples: The apprentice priest who only ever talks about his faith, and how it will save them, or the good father who is a solid rock in our main characters life, to only be tragically taken away. Don't get me wrong, sometimes you feel with these characters, they do get through a lot of horrible situations. I'd just wish that there would've been a bigger focus on their developement as the story progressed, so that they wouldn't continue to feel so two dimensional. \n\nAnother aspect of these bland characters is the voice acting/facial animation. I do not for a second believe that french kids sounds like swedish youtubers, that especially when their faces don't show any emotion as they converse in the world. This doesn't apply to the main character Hugo though. I loved his characters voice acting, and i think you will too. \n\nPRICE TAG & GAME LENGTH:\nFor a whopping 45 euro this game can be completed in about 8½ hours. (I estimate that if you really wanted to you could squeeze that time up to 11 hours, by searching every nook and cranny for collectibles) That is way too short in my opinion for that kind of price. \n\nWORLD: \nOne of my biggest frustrations with this game, was how it turned from a realistic adventure through a plague ridden france, into a dark fantasy world dominated by evil rat magic and ancient prophecies. Don't get me wrong, the world looks and feels amazing, but as the plague intensifies so does the black/yellow goop that follows with it (Looks a lot like the goop from Amnesia the dark descent) I do realize that this complaint is propably by far exclusive to me, but it wouldn't be an honest review if i didn't disclose what i had the biggest problems with, and this was definitely one of them.\n\nWhen that is said and done, i also have to state that this world still manages to present the plague spot on. (Corpse piles, Ravens everywhere, People in great pain, Abandoned Houses and so on) \n\nMUSIC:\nThe music in this game is amazing and it really gives the game a fantastic atmosphere, as it reacts to events happening. \n\nGAMEPLAY: \nThe gameplay was in my opinion really good. Imagine the stealth, ressource collection and a bit worse aim than The Last of Us, and you'll have a pretty precise idea of how the game feels. \n\nCONCLUSION: \nDespite my often, negative sounding comments, i quite like this game. I bought it to get the classic singleplayer story experience in a plague ridden world, and i was not entirely disappointed as i no longer need to satisfy that urge. I'm gonna miss the feeling of protecting the sweet little boy, Hugo, but besides that i don't really have any kind of urge to return to A Plague Tale Innocence. \n\nIf its ever on sale for 25euro or less i would give it a positive score, and a solid recommendation.",Not Recommended
"9 out of 10\n\nTl;dr – Summary\n-----\nBeautiful game all around. Beautiful landscapes, visuals, music, and storytelling. Primarily a linear, story based stealth game with minor action elements. The action isn’t hard, but trying to do a lot by stealth can be. The engine is new, it feels clunky at times, but supports new directions for game development. I believe this will be a seminal game that is definitely worth experiencing.\n\nThe Good\n-----\nA beautiful piece of storytelling with amazing visuals, excellent music, and great voice acting. You don’t really play this game, you experience it. And if you enjoy an immersive, story heavy game, then this is a game you should experience.\n\nThis game is so beautiful because A Plague Tale didn’t rent one of current, commonplace physics engines used in nearly every pseudo-3D game on the market today. They made their own engine, and with it Asobo was able to achieve new artistic heights. Despite being a new engine, the gameplay is generally clean and feels pretty familiar.\n\nSome balk at the release price for a 10-15 h game, but the engine makes it worth every penny to me. Not only does it mean there is a new engine to support visually stunning games, but competition is healthy. Other engines may feel compelled to strive for more significant and timely updates, which is better for all of us.\n\nThis is one of the first games in a very long time that drew me back over and over because I wanted to see the next part of the story. Characters are developed into interesting and unique personalities with relatively little screen time, which is another real art. While a few tropes are used, they don’t feel too cliché. Plot twists are not overdone or overreaching. Overall, excellent storytelling.\n\nThe game is best described as a stealth driven, toned down Tomb Raider. Most of the time you have either relatively simple room puzzles or stealth oriented areas. There is a low action/combat mode that becomes more important later. Eventually, you get enough gear that killing every bad guy isn’t too tough. Some have complained that the game doesn’t have a hard mode, which I think is rubbish. If you are relying heavily on combat, then you are in easy mode. If you want a challenge, do as much as you can without killing.\n\nOverall, I believe this will be a seminal game that is hopefully a sign of greater things to come in gaming.\n\nThe Bad\n-----\nThere are moments where the engine feels a tad clunky, but this should be expected from a new engine. Some interface issues will get smoothed out as the engine evolves.\n\nThe game is 100% linear and there are no real choices to be made. This isn’t necessarily bad, as long as you aren’t expecting a heavy “choices matter” game, like Telltale.\n\nFor being so beautiful in so many regards, the engine doesn’t do immersive and reactive faces well. While the faces are incredibly detailed, they still don’t move like a face moves…which admittedly is a very hard thing to do.\n\nLate in the game, it transitions from a stealth primary to a pseudo-action game, and the engine isn’t mature enough to support an action game style. While it did well to support an engaging story/game in this new style, it felt fairly out-of-character for me, and I wish it had stuck to its stealth roots a bit more.",Recommended
"This is an absolutely amazing game in every aspect. I will say it is a niche game, if you don't like linear story based games with a lot of sneaking and puzzles, this game is probably not for you. However, the story is this game is by far the best of any game I have played in a long time. The graphics are astonishing, the voice acting is breath-taking, the attention-to-detail behind this game is perfect. Combat is exciting and challenging, and the characters are very well developed.\nI paid full price for this game, and it was probably the best $50 dollars I have spent on pure entertainment all year. I would call this game a masterpiece and definitely a strong candidate for Game-of-the-Year",Recommended
"Very good, even though a tad overpriced. But considering the atrocious lack of Recommended quality on today's gaming market, I'll take it.\n\nPros:\n- Very immersive experience.\n- Decent story.\n- Great storytelling, focused on the relationship between the main two protagonists.\n- Good graphics and animations.\n- Fluid game-play mechanics.\n- Decent character development. I really like the fact they kept the main protagonist's evolution within believable limits at all times. You'll develop her gear and knowledge, making her more lethal by being wittier instead of stronger. Would've been awkward to see her lifting huge swords and cutting heads off.\n- Well implemented crafting mechanics, giving you a feeling of always being on your toes, even if the resources are plentiful.\n- Good balance for game-play difficulty, keeping you active without becoming tedious or interfering with the experience of the story (note: for Dark Souls or Sekiro fans it will however feel like a walk in the park, so consider yourselves warned).\n- It's definitely not one big escort mission. Your companion will never get in your way and will actually be useful on various occasions.\n\nCons (but not deterrents):\n- Most times the game-play feels almost on rails: one room - one puzzle - one solution. You only get to put your creativity to work when you need to take out groups of enemies, which is very rare (another warning here: the game-play actually consists in environmental puzzles, and the ""combat"" falls pretty much under the same category).\n- Not much exploration to be done off the main path. You have some rare loot pockets on the map and some predefined events, but that's it.\n- Some redundant skills (enough to be worth mentioning though).\n- Fairly frequent FPS drops. They didn't hinder my game-play though.\n- NO REPLAY VALUE.\n\nWell, that's about it. One more thing worth mentioning: I was very reluctant I'd enjoy a game having two kids as main protagonists, but I ended up truly connecting to them and even getting that badas* feeling on many occasions (yes, for both of them).",Recommended
"Sneaking past guards, sneaking past rats and ... whoops, there's nothing more than sneaking. Again, again, and again. Stepped a few pixels wrong? The rats eat you, but since this is the 120th time in the game, you sigh, the scary effect lost upon you a long time ago, as you struggle to even play the game to the end.\n\nPlay this if you like stealthy games. If you expect an immersive story-rich adventure, you're in for a disappointment.",Not Recommended

"Overall a very nice game.\n\n- Starts out good, manages to capture your interest.\n- Introduces you to new abilities throughout the entire story.\n- Crafting and skills management enhances your battles against the enemies.\n- Becomes somewhat ''Press this button on time to win this battle.'' towards the end of the game, making itself a frustrating experience not allowing/giving player the option/choice to approach to situations differently or accordingly.\n\nI would recommend this game to those who seek for an adventure and a nice story with okay side characters, however though the game has its issues here and there sometimes having the accompany AI getting itself stuck on the path or anywhere across the field leaving the rest of the experience not-so-enjoyable.\n\n7.5/10",Recommended

"Disclaimer: This is one of those *It's Not All Bad* reviews.  \nHowever, when I go looking at reviews for a game, I like to look at some positive and some negative to see what people have to say.  And if I give this game a thumbs-up it's just going to get buried under all the adoring praise for this indie darling.  So thumbs-down.  It's not a terrible game, but it has some serious issues.  \n\nI. Gameplay\nAt best the gameplay is average.  You can sneak around adequately, hiding behind walls, calling your brother, stuff we've seen many times before.  \nAt worst the gameplay is frustratingly bad.  The combat in this game is basically binary.  Did you see an enemy before he saw you, and shoot a rock at him?  Then: Win.  If he saw you first, you have about a second to try to aim your rock at him before a cutscene triggers and you simply die.  \nShooting rocks at enemies is finicky, with the game sometimes telling you you're going to hit, and then you miss.  And don't even bother shooting a rock ala hip-fire, because the game only registers a hit if it first gives you a little yellow icon saying 'yea you're gonna hit'.  Which, as I say, is not always accurate.  Moving enemies often register as 'yes it will hit' and then the rock sails past them, directly where their head was 2 seconds ago.  \nAside from shooting rocks and alchemy rocks, you get the ability to basically do 'magic' at the end of the game.  Except after hyping it up it's surprisingly weak.  This is particularly because the aiming mechanism for this 'magic' is even worse than the rocks.  There's no depth perception to it, so if you want to aim at anything more than 5 feet away, good luck.  \nLastly, the puzzles.  The majority of the puzzles in the game are: ""How do I get fire to an area so the rats won't kill me"".  But there are 2 sections that I swear are only there to pad the game length.  These 2 puzzles are boring, slow moving, not at all thought provoking, and take up the entire Chapter.  2 of the 16 chapters of the game are devoted to these inane puzzles.\n\nII. Setting\nThis is more of a personal gripe, but I really grew a lot less interested when it became abundantly clear that 'magic' was the cause of all the conflict in the game.  They start the game off and periodically make references to an ACTUAL historical setting, but then about halfway through it's just... magic.  Would it not have been so much cooler if the game were a legit historical fiction?  Two kids running away from The Inquisition in Southern France, during the onset of the Black Death?  You'd have a cool setting, a real time period that might actually teach the player something, and a unique game.  But for some reason they start with a very promising setting and suddenly revert to a cliche video game trope as old as time: magic.  \n\nIII. Story\nSlightly different than setting is the story, the tale of how these two kids meet other kids and their interactions.  Unfortunately the story is nowhere near as interesting as the setting.  You basically have the 2nd act of Peter Pan set in medieval France.  The story is beat-for-beat so dreadfully predictable that I was going AFK for the overly dramatic cutscenes at the end.  If you really try you might convince yourself to get invested in these characters, but I could not.  I felt the same way about ""Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons,"" a game Wikipedia lists as an inspiration for the developers.  \n\nIV. Performance\nThis game crashed multiple times during my play-through, notably several times near the end of sections I had to entirely redo.  My computer's not top of the line, but I visited a site that benchmarks games and they listed this game as maxing out even a 2080Ti card.  \n\n\nAll in all I'd say this game was average.  I'm glad the developers made it; it's always nice to see attempts at high quality indie games without microtransactions and season passes.  But I'm definitely not on the bandwagon for this being GOTY or anything of that nature.  \n\n",Not Recommended
"A masterpiece in cinematic storytelling. Perhaps more than any other game, A Plague Tale captures the natural character development of two children thrown into a hellish scenario that tests their morals and relationship. This is all thanks to the emotionally convincing performances of our two lead characters. I really felt the intensity of each shocking moment that they come across and felt a connection to nearly all characters. This title easily surpasses similar games like The Last of Us in the storytelling department. Top that off with a phenomenal soundtrack from the greatest video game composer of the decade, Olivier Deriviere. Every scene is made more intense by the game's haunting composition. While the gameplay is a tad bit shallow and the levels are very linear and setpiece heavy. It's purposely designed that way for the sake of its narrative. I also have to give props for the beautiful graphics given that this is a middle market title at a budget price. The scenery and character models are all intricately detailed. It's one of the best looking games to come out of this year. Unfortunately, the same can't be said for the very stiff animations. Regardless, this is easily a game of the year nominee. Highly recommended.",Recommended
Awesome story and stealth gameplay. Graphics are really great.,Recommended
"Yes. This was a good one.  The mechanics grew a little tiresome.  I thought they could have done more with the the dodge mechanics which really only were featured in the first boss fight. Also, the cost of some of the ammo and upgrade made it that it wasn't worth using them - limiting the strategies that you could follow. That said, the writing, artistry and production quality of this game was absolutely superb and makes this game easily worth playing and enjoying. A very memorable game with a very different kind of story.",Recommended
This game is fun and engaging and the story is really good.,Recommended
"Very cool game. The story, dialogue, game play, graphics and characters were excellent in this game the boss battles were unique and fun. i really enjoyed this game. we need more single player games like this. this games was worth the 44.99 price tag at launch. the trailers that steam has on the store page do not do this game justice. if your thinking about buying this game YT some game play because its much better that it looks",Recommended
yes,Recommended
Really nice story worth the time.,Recommended
"A really enjoyable medieval tale. The only real downer was around midway through the game when one of the main characters takes a back seat, which takes away half of the charm and makes everything more action-orientated. A lot of players would probably appreciate that but I preferred it beforehand. \n\nI hope Asobo come back at us with another game set in a different time!",Recommended
"So... Another surprise, another game that came from God's hands!\nWonderful graphics, another magnificent soundtrack that distracts you from the real world to give the full attention that the game really deserves.\n\nI'm being honest, I'm proud of these awesome titles, this game is very similar with Hellblade, both are the actual best example of story-driven games that I played, I feel the honor and the pleasure to be apart of these videogame's Era and have the chance to play them, not because the sentimental moments, but the protagonists.\nHugo the cuttest child I've ever seen in one game like this one, always by Amicia's side, his sister, both incredible protagonists and Recommended warriors! Including that seeing that kind of sibling's love between them is so exciting and emotional. \n\nI'd recommend this obviously, at the moment this is the best game I've played this year... give it a try. You won't regret!",Recommended
"There's allegedly a great story here.  In the five hours I played I didn't see it.  What I did see was a promising adventure buried under incredibly dull and linear gameplay.  I don't understand the praise this game is getting.  Yes, the art style, voice acting, soundtrack, lighting/shadow visuals, and premise are all good, but beyond that, the actual game, not sure where that is.  The story definitely isn't bad, but not worth dealing with the rest of the game.\n\nThe core gameplay revolves around stealth.  You can crouch in tall plant life to stay hidden and throw rocks at key things to distract enemies and sneak around them.  Occasionally, you can knock them out with your sling. There's an additional enemy in the form of the rat swarms. These are afraid of light, so all you have to do is stick with a light source.  Some boss fights are thrown in, which are similarly simple.  You have upgrades you can do to your equipment, which you can go out of your way to try to find the needed supplies for, but they seem mostly pointless and just there to tick a checkbox on the features list.  The problem is this gameplay is so simple, the level design so linear and void of flexibility, the world so empty of exploratory detail, that the game becomes you just following its instructions to reach the end.   The only deaths, difficulty, or challenge you may encounter has to do with bugs or you thinking you have a choice on how to actually progress through a level.  There is one way, one path, one exit. This quickly removes the illusion of exploration that the game initially might give you and instills a sense of dullness that it never recovered from for me.\n\nThere's also a big problem with a suspension of disbelief in the way you interact with your little brother.  He can go into areas you can't, because he's supposedly smaller (which he is), and unlock doors or gather equipment.  The problem is you play as a small teenage girl.  By comparison the human enemies you encounter, which are all men, are all almost twice her size. From what I can see visually in the game, she could easily fit herself through all these parts that only the little kid can apparently fit through if she tried.  At her widest part, her hips, she's not much bigger than her brother and her brother fits through these areas with plenty of space around him.  About one and a half of him could squeeze through.  I know this is a classic video game trope, but it stands out here a bit more because they're core parts of the progression to the game.  Usually you only see this problem in modern games anymore in parts where it doesn't really make sense for your character to to even go into that area. We've seen in recent years games do a way with this type of problem in parts where it makes sense for the character to try to squeeze through small openings.  Just odd.\n\nI wasn't able to finish the game.  Moved onto something else.  Maybe as a movie, or watching a lets play of it, it'd be good and you'd get just the story without having to deal with playing through it.  This game feels like it's in between genres.  It feels like an attempt at an adventure game, but also a steal action game.  Unfortunately, it achieves not much in either direction.\n\nAlso, given it's price and projected length of about 8 hours with no replayability and very little in terms of actual gameplay, it's a very steep price.",Not Recommended
A beautiful game with rich storytelling and characters.  A Plague Tale takes place during one of Europe’s darkest moments and Asobo Studio has done a tremendous job in bringing this world to life. The graphics are amazing. The soundtrack is haunting and phenomenal as well as the voice acting. My only qualm is the gameplay mechanics are quite simple. But I’ll be honest with you. You don’t play this type of game for the mechanics; you play it for the immersive story and characters. This is one of my favorite games of 2019.,Recommended
great storytelling and beautiful environments,Recommended
"My favourite game of 2019 so far, and it's probably going to stay that way. Also one of my all-time favourites. Technically stunning - texture work, level design and the rats... Seeing the massive sea of rats for the first time is going to become a gaming memory that's going to stay with you for a lifetime. The game simply looks beautiful.\n\nA Plague Tale is a dark, gritty and shocking story set during the initial years of the Hundred Years' War. The mature themes combined with superior direction, which could rival the best movies or TV series out there, make for a story that keeps you on the edge of your seat till the very last chapter.\n\nThe experience wouldn't be the same, however, without the spectacular soundtrack which quickly broke into my personal top 5 gaming soundtracks of all time. The cello is a powerful instrument, man, and the Inquisition theme you get introduced to in the very first chapter is extremely dark, heavy and foreboding. Played during a tense and emotional section of the game, it sets the tone for the entire game, letting you know what you've got yourself into.\n\nThe game is also a shining example of how you can and should do introductions and tutorials, and how to tie them in properly with the story. Hats off.\n\nGameplay is solid as well. There's stealth, puzzles, crafting and some slingshot combat to keep you occupied when you're not busy admiring the incredible vistas or having your heart broken by all the developments, or having your ankles nibbled on by the endless dark seas of rats. The tension's high and moments of respite are very few and far between.\n\nThe game does have a tiny $2 DLC with additional coats of arms/costume colors for Amicia and Hugo which was a preorder bonus - got it separately near the end of my playthrough since I realized the developers well deserved the money.\n\nAll in all an extremely well crafted game with very few bugs and flaws, which are not even worth mentioning in the review. A solid recommendation for anyone who likes grimdark story-driven experiences, with impeccable art and no multiplayer/DLC/microtransactions bull. I hope A Plague Tale: Innocence receives the recognition it deserves and sets a trend, because we do need more engrossing singleplayer stories in our games.",Recommended
"If you are here you probably know what this game is about. The game does its Job superbly. \nI espescially liked the atmosphere and was not expecting the verarity of gameplay mechanics. Every chapter of the game gives you new difficulties and new and different ways to solve them. I was never bored with the gameplay. The bond between the two main charaters Amicia and Hugo and the arc of it is beautiful and a thing to adore.\n\nIf you would press me for negatives: \n~11h für ~45€ maybe considered a bit short, but in my opinion better than artificially prolonged lenght by repetition or boring gameplay.

"Easily the most ""meh"" game I have ever played; nothing about it was terrible, but nothing stood out either.\n\nGoing into a game like this I fully expected it to have mediocre gameplay. It's presented as a narrative-first experience and that's totally okay. The problem lies in the fact that the story isn't very good either. Let's break it down by each category: \n\n- Story\nThe bread and butter of the game. It actually is pretty interesting through about half the game, but as it starts to dive deeper into the more fantastical elements of story it starts to go downhill. And the ending, oh boy. Talk about going out with a wimper. The story progressively gets worse as the game goes on and that's the opposite of what you want to see in a game like this. The voice acting in particular is... not great for a game where it really needs to be. \n\n- Gameplay\nYou probably know going into a game like this that the gameplay is going to take a backseat to the story and that's definitely the case here. The majority of the game is filled with very basic puzzles that involve using fire and Amicia's sling to avoid the hoardes of plague rats. It's fun enough, but none of the puzzles are remotely challenging and the human enemies are little more than a small nuisance. There can be an added degree of difficulty if you choose to try to find all the collectibles (which I highly recommend you do) as some of them can be pretty well-hidden. \n\n- Graphics\nNot much to say here. The lighting is actually very well done, but the actual character models are pretty average for a game made in 2019. Hair looks pretty awkward and the facial expressions are surprisingly emotionless for a game that focuses on story so much. \n\n- Soundtrack\nA few tracks stand out, particularly during the more tense moments in the story, but most of them are forgettable. This isn't Bear McCreary or Mick Gordon we're talking about here. \n\nOverall I'd give this game about a 5/10. It is definitely not worth the price (and thus not a game I can recommend), but is probably worth picking up on sale in the future if you're into these sort of narrative-driven games.",Not Recommended
This game was an impulse buy and honestly I do not regret it one bit. It has a very immersive story and playing a female protagonist is refreshing too. I hope there's a sequel to this game some day because I would definitely get it!,Recommended
If you love a game that focuses on storytelling go get yourself this thing! But make sure you are ready for a ride on an emotional rollercoaster. I won't say more so you don't get spoiled.

"Pretty short game, I took my time and it only took me about 8 hours to complete, but it was an amazing game. Great story telling and just overall great characters. You can't help but get completely engrossed by the universe the devs created.

It makes sense, but I only wish the game was longer since I absolutely loved it.",Recommended

"If you like a story and companions that actually work AND are good characters, buy this.\nMy one warning is that it isn't super long (I finished in about 9 hours but wasn't super thorough)\nAside from that though this is one of the best games I have played in a long while, great characters I actually cared about, great story that made sense, fun gameplay mechanics, AI of your companions actually works and isn't usually frustrating, and an intense atmosphere that had me cursing under my breath in full panic mode several times.\nThat last part might just be because I stress easy but games usually don't get me so take that as you will.\n\nTL:DR fantastic story, great gameplay, cool atmosphere, buy this game",Recommended
"This game was really well made. It wasn't perfect and there were bits that were annoying, but overall it was fantastic. The graphics were amazing and ran really well. The story was well written. It was very intriguing and kept me interested the whole way through. Would definitely recommend this to anyone who enjoys single-player story games.",Recommended
Very good story and fun gameplay. Always introducing new mechanics and abilities as you progress and opens more doors to gameplay. The game is very stealth heavy but you can really dish out some damage even when spotted later on in the game. The story and sounds/music is where A Plague Tale really shines. Nearly an hour in you already care and sympathize with the main characters and side characters and continue to build a relationship with them. That along with the chilling violin scenes/moments and the amazing music in the environment really sets up immersive and fun scenario. Definitely recommend the game.,Recommended
This is one of the best games I've played in a while. I do wish though that more details were added explaining everything behind... well... not spoiling :^p\n\nAmazing game! 8.5/10~,Recommended
"A Plague Tale doesn't give a fuck about the current state of the gaming industry. It's a simple, 10 hour single player game that legitimately left me wanting more. In a world of live services, denuvo and scummy microtransactions, that's impressive. Asobo and Focus have knocked it out of the park with this, it runs great, looks alright and it doesn't have any extra DRM that is designed to harm paying customers. \n\nThe rats themselves are probably the big talking point, and it's understandable why that is. You can manipulate them later on in the game, but they're mostly your enemy in the beginning. Seeing them flock towards an enemy or some form of meat was pretty funny at times, but that's not a bad thing. The main issue is the price, but at least this game simply tells a story and leaves it at that, with no nebulous content like a lot of Ubisoft games.\n\nBasically, it's great, go buy it. It's easily one of the best games of this generation, alongside Doom 2016, and most of the Sony exclusives.",Recommended
"I happened to search for stealth tagged games on steam, luckily, a few days before this game was released. I love challenging stealth games - I played Horizon Zero Dawn, Last of Us, and others on their hardest difficulties only cause I like punishing stealth. However this game is probably the easiest, most linear game I have played in a long time. It would be easy for everyone. Stealth is a weak word since the guards barely notice you if you run by quick in front of them. But wait, you might ask, ""How is this person recommending this game?!""\n\nThis game is definitely a favorite. The storyline, atmosphere, and generally fun gameplay make this a definite buy. Think of this as an interactive movie where you progress through stealth puzzles the whole time. While the answers are obvious, it's fun to watch things play out, and the characters react. Some reviews have criticized how Amicia seems horrified at murders and then seems to not care by the end. I enjoyed watching her character slide from horror to actively wanting revenge after weeks to months of being in survival mode, trying to protect her brother. The few friendly characters they meet along the way are definitely great additions as well. It's really easy to add characters whose purpose you question. Everything fit together nicely though.\n\nDefinitely a great ~15 hour game to play.",Recommended
"Great survival game with a excellent compelling story in a dark period of Europe history , really love the game mechanics with the option of either avoid fight or kill your enemies in order to protect your little brother",Recommended
This game is a Hellblade Senua's sacrifice Clone. A game I loved. The graphics on this game are simply amazing!!  So why cant I recommend this game.  Well I can and I can not. Some gamer's will love this game and I respect that. This game is beautiful however the gaming mechanics are simple and to be honest silly.  The story is geared for children. There is a simplicity to this game that does not transcend it self.  It is beautiful it is simple and is ultimately boring.  I will no doubt continue to play until the end.  A little here and a little there. This game is not horrible by any stretch of the imagination.  However wonderful graphics and somewhat interesting story line does always equal a worthwhile gaming experience.  Wait for it to go on sale.  Buy Hellblade first and if you are not amazed pass on this game all together.,Not Recommended

"I will start by saying how pleasantly surprised i am by this game. \n\nI didn't expect it to be such well made. It took me almost 12 hours to finish it, but of course if you explore more, gather more supplies, collectibles it can go easily 2-3 hours more. However in those 12 hours, not once did i feel bored with this game. This is actually a narrative driven game where the story plays the crucial part. \n\nAnd not only is it a great story, but a really, really well told story at that. The pivotal characters of the game namely Amicia De Rune and Hugo De Rune are genuinely well written characters with excellent dialogue, voice acting from the actors. The gameplay is simple and linear, however it's thoroughly tied in the game's narrative, which of course includes something as bizarre as rats. Even though it's linear, the gameplay didn't feel simple or stagnant because of how invested i was in the story. Perhaps the most memorable story i have played since The Witcher 3. \n\nThe sound effects in the game are top notch, the music is both epic and suits the game's theme really well. The graphics are easily the top of industry, great lighting effects, excellent locations and level design. \n\nI'm not aware of this game's developer Asobo Studio but they have put not only their talent but their heart in this game too. If anything i will very happy if there was a sequel announced, the way the puzzles, stealth sections were designed tells how seriously the developers took their game. I think such games and developers should always be supported.\n\nIf you like a story based game with memorable characters, good gameplay and awesome music, this game is for you.",Recommended
"After finishing the game about 5 minutes prior to this review, all I can say is WOW!  This game is such a gem that any player who is in to story driven games, needs to play this.  The first that caught my eye was the visuals.  So much detail and effort was put into this game.  There were some minor bugs, but nothing game breaking.  The stealth is fun and very fluid.  This era in history is very unique and one that is told not too often. The only other game that I know of set in this time period is the Black Death and it's not great.  The developers made the plague a very real concrete threat by the excellent use of rats.  Plus the player also has to watch for the invading inquisition.  The game was short, but worth it.  \n\nAmazing game that has my vote for game of the year if nominated.",Recommended

"[h1] France, 1348, a dark plague hovers over this earth[/h1]\n\nThis story is about Amicia and Hugo, two brothers who doesn't know each other that well due the circumstances but slowly they will build a relation of mutual protection and affection from beginning to end while the inquisition goes after them but not only that but also they will need to survive in a nation affected by the war and the dark plague.\n\nThe story is really interesting and intriguing, it kept me with a lot of attention to the details, Characters also made this really easy as they are really enjoyable, from the thief brothers to Lucas and Rodric, let's not forget about Nicholas and the rest of the church people, really powerful characters designed to be scary, and they sure are. \n\nNow the story is good but the places we visit? those are another level of detail, you can be easily walking through one of the most beautiful forests you have seen and the next thing you see is the most crude and grotesque scene of blood, violence and death. Is crazy how well implemented is everything and how coherent it is, it's a dark age where bad things happen, if you like abandoned places, obscure villages and pure nature from time to time, you will be pleased by what this game is going to offer you. \n\nWhat about sound? well, I played the game in French because I wanted to get a bit more of immersion with the language, really good dub and music is really good too. \n\nGameplay is probably the most divisive thing this game will have (probably) as it asks you to be sneaky and avoid conflict as much as you can for the most part of the game, to put an example, it's like being sneaky in The Last of Us, if you liked that system this is the same, and if you like avoiding conflict then this is a great experience although the game will have moments of violence where avoiding conflict is not an option.\n\nIn general I absolutely loved this experience and is so far my favorite game of 2019, I enjoyed it so much and so I hope you all enjoy it as much as I did, please, consider buying and enjoy this wonderful and terrifying journey alongside Amicia, Hugo and friends.",Recommended

Good story,Recommended
"If I would have to describe “A Plague Tale: Innocence” in one sentence I’d say:\n“It’s like a medieval Tomb Raider with more magic, more corpses and a looot more aggressive Rats”.\nSince you can see that I’ve given this a thumbs up, let it be said that I like pretty much all of these things even tho no Game mechanic introduced in this game is really that new. Yet it’s the combination that makes it along with a really, really good story. \nI know that I probably sound like every other damn “Gaming Magazine” out there but I don’t care because that’s just the fact. And since I’ve said something good now let’s go straight to the nagging, yeah?\nIt’s an awesome story but I’ve played it through in about one night and I’m one of those people who normally goes through every damn corner of the game so that’s really not much at all. In all honesty it felt a lot more like one episode of Life is Strange 2 then a full game and drawing that particular parallel is also Recommended to something else. Speaking, of course, about being the big sibling who’s helping the little brother with Superpowers. It’s a bit funny but not really a negative so don’t get me wrong here. I think it’s actually quite enjoyable when the protagonist is not actually the big hero with all the powers and strictly not the chosen one but rather a person to help those along. So kudos for that I GUESS…\nBut there’s more stuff that annoyed me a bit. And that is something next to no game with stealth elements seems to get right: AI that is actually intelligent and not just artificial. \nI mean you seriously have to do aloooot to get seen or noticed in this game. I even got a screenshot of me crouching right next to an npc while my companion is right in front of him but somehow that noice little Inquisition fellow does not seem to mind. How very nice of him indeed. I thought this was France tho and not Britain. Well they all have a British accent at least. So maybe I’m just mistaken here and they aren’t dumb but rather way too polite to tell me that it bothers them that I’m there and try to murder them or their leader.\nSo, yes, if you are in to everlasting games that will drain your soul from how difficult they are until you eat your own controller then Plague Tale: Innocence ain’t it. Go do some more Dark Souls or any damn Clone.\n\nHowever, Ladies, Gentlemen and those who layeth betwixt: If you’re looking for a horrifying story that will keep you on the edge of your seat for how dark and thrilling it is along with a mixture of nice and familiar game mechanics from all over the Adventure-Genre then this wonderful piece of art is something for you. Even though it could’ve lasted a lot longer. But there will sure as hell be another one anyway so there’s that.\nI for one am happy to have invested some of my precious money into this little piece of art because I think that’s what it is and because I think this is the standalone singleplayer experience we all love and deserve. And so should you. Might it just be to tell the so called “TRIPPLE A”-Gaming Market to go fuck itself with all it’s new models and Loot shooters. \n\nThanks for reading this and have fun. YAY!",Recommended
"This game takes place during the Kingdom of France and the devastating pandemic, Black Plague. \nThis game combines horror, action, stealth, and story. The story, art, and sound track all benefit the excellence of this game.",Recommended
"A Plague Tale is one of my favorite experiences so far this year because it’s an outlier. It knows the story it wants to tell and it tells it in a tight and well-paced manner—and then it ends. Given the sprawling and ultimately pointless stories we get from the usual open-world fare, A Plague Tale feels like a refreshing alternative. I’m surprised (and grateful) it got made at all, and I hope Asobo Studio’s earned another experiment like this in the future.\nNevertheless, I enjoyed it.",Recommended
"This game was amazing. I had quite a blast playing it. The game not super long but it's enough to enjoy (beat the game). I really enjoyed the story, graphics, controls, combat, stealth, and crafting in the game. I would highly recommend picking this game up. It's has a sort of little taste if you put The Last of Us & Horizon Zero Dawn put together. If you get a chance to play it you will love it. It's even worth playing a second round of it too.",Recommended
"[h1]Come for the Rats, Stay for the Characters[/h1]\n[i]A Plague Tale: Innocence[/i] is a lot of things: a historical piece, puzzler, shooter...  but first and foremost, it is a strong narrative experience.  Sitting down and playing this game once or twice will inevitably lead to you marathon-ing out the rest of it as soon as you hit the climax.  At least, that's what happened to me.  With lovable characters and relatively engaging gameplay, Asobo Studio delivers in [i]A Plague Tale: Innocence[/i] an indie classic (albeit one that I will never, EVER replay).\n\n[b]Gameplay[/b] - 2.5/5\nAt its core, the gameplay of [i]A Plague Tale: Innocence[/i] struggles to find balance between stealth, shooting and crafting.  It's not unenjoyable, per sé, but it tries to do far too much.  Players will have to bounce between cover-shooting, light puzzles and a myriad of other challenges to proceed through levels.  There are several different ways to bypass each challenge, but most of the time the player is rewarded for brute-forcing their way through encounters through insane amounts of multitasking.  By the end, you'll be bouncing around your alchemical admixtures and dealing with the final mechanic...  which I will not spoil, but by gosh is it wonky.  I kept finding myself groaning about having to repeat a level after something stupid and unexpected happened near the tail end of the checkpoint.  And trust me, it will happen.\n\n[b]Story[/b] - 4.5/5\nThe strength of [i]A Plague Tale: Innocence[/i] is in its writing.  Asobo knocked it out of the freaking ballpark in regards to the game's narrative.  The voice actors are absolutely superb, bringing to life a cast of orphan children finding respite from a harsh, plague-torn medieval society in each other's love and acceptance.  If you have the anime chops to read the subtitles in English while listening to the game in French, I would wholeheartedly recommend it.  The thrilling story and empathetic characters will easily push you through any gameplay dips the game throws your way.  Strong female leads, incredibly emotional performances...  There is just so much to love here.\n\n[b]Themes/Setting[/b] - 4/5\nLeave it to a French indie developer to brilliantly capture plague-era France.  There are an incredible amount of fantastic setpieces, from the Inquisition to the Papal politics of the time.  Collectible flowers, gifts, and codices exist in every level that organically give the player insights into the game's dark time period.  The graphics are great as well, especially for an indie studio.  The only thing detracting from visual perfection is the rats.  They are scary and intimidating at first, but their movement and gameplay quickly becomes comical over time.  Aside from that misstep, however, this game nails dark age aesthetics to a T.\n\n[b]Conclusion[/b]\nThere is so much to enjoy about [i]A Plague Tale: Innocence[/i].  Beautiful setpieces, incredible character performances and a beautifully-written story are all contained in this short, inexpensive package.  Even though the experience is marred with subpar gameplay and goofy/idiotic AI, [i]A Plague Tale: Innocence[/i] is well worth at least one playthrough on its narrative merits alone.",Recommended
"Wow. I don't typically write reviews but I think I really had to write one for this game in particular. I've been burnt out from the multiplayer game genres and was desperately looking for something restricted to Singleplayer only. Nothing excessively long with side quests like the Witcher series... just something simple with a good story.\n\nWell let me just say that this game definitely surpassed my expectations! The story was absolutely amazing and very original. It gave a PS4 exclusive (TLoU, GoW, Uncharted, etc.) vibe which is what I've desperately wanted to experience on the PC. The soundtracks were on point and brought many emotions to the player. There better be a sequel to this game or I'll be very upset.",Recommended

"This game was really fun and had a lot of surprising twists which I really enjoyed. I will say that this is a very story driven game, and as a result the gameplay can be a bit repetitive but I still liked most of the stealth/combat. I did personally find the story to be really unique and interesting, while also being very engaging with strong characters. A lot of the game is focused on puzzles which are very interesting to me. The French dark ages setting was also very cool, something that I personally found very unique and refreshing especially for single player story driven games. There's a big emphasis on stealth, but I found that to be a fun mechanic since your character is so weak, albeit requiring some patience a good bit of the time. I liked the visuals quite a lot, especially for a game by a smaller studio. I only encountered 2 minor bugs the whole game which were resolved when repeating the same action button. Overall I really recommend it, I very much liked the story and hope there's more to come in this same setting/universe.",Recommended

In 2019 when battle royale and multiplayer games seem to be everywhere, it's a pleasant suprise to have a fairly short single player game with a very solid narrative, and characters.

I got the game for £30 and i'd say it was worth the money, however It may have been smarter for me to wait for a deal at around £20, which feels more appropriate in comparison to the scale of the game.

The game follows a young girl and her even younger brother on a journey to survive against all odds. It's a story of family, hope, and rats — lots and lots of rats.\n\n[i]Note: trimmed sections of this review to fit Steam char limit, check vid for full version![/i]\n\n[h1]Pros:[/h1]\n[list][*][b]Story-driven game with an actually interesting story.[/b] In a world full of battle royales, live service models, and broken launches, it is an absolute pleasure to have something like A Plague Tale: Innocence release. This is a game without any of the gimmicks we usually see from big-budget games. There's no roadmap for future additions, no micro-transactions, and no online component taking away from the core game. It is a ""Recommended"" singleplayer experience and it really shows.\n\nHowever, a game should not be judged based on what it isn't, and that is exactly where A Plague Tale's story comes in. To be specific, this is a story-driven game where the story is actually really good. It takes a setting we don't usually see in the medium, that being France during the Black Death, and lets us play through the eyes of a 15 year-old girl, giving us an innocent perspective on the whole event. This actually provides for a very cool contrast given the dark nature of the game's themes, which is only furthered by the fact that the girl's much younger brother tags along for the ride.\n\nIt's not just the setting and main characters through, the story does so much more. It takes players on a journey through new, cool areas, introduces a variety of well-written characters with their own stories to tell, and manages to do all of this without stumbling along the way. It's not perfect (more on that later), but it managed to keep me on the edge of my seat for its entire eight hour runtime.\n\n[*][b]Great aesthetic.[/b] Given that this is coming from a developer that usually doesn't work on games like this, I was really surprised with just how visually stunning the game is. Throughout the game, you'll see excellent examples of volumetric lighting, textures sourced from high-res photos, and even animations that actually feel natural. What's even more surprising is the fact that all of this was done on an engine developed by the studio itself, rather than the popular choices like Unreal or Unity.\n\nWhat the game does visually, however, it also does on the audio front. Take the voice acting for example. It not only manages to capture the fluctuating intensity of the story, but also helps in maintaining that contrast I mentioned earlier. The main character's younger brother, Hugo, is an excellent example of this. His lines and voice really give the impression of being innocent and naive, even when surrounded by darkness. Voice acting like this really helps in serving up a more immersive story and Plague Tale pretty much nails it.\n\nAside from the voice acting, there's also the great soundtrack. You have your simple, more mellow tunes, your ominous, ambient tracks, and even some more action-oriented pieces. However, what makes it even cooler is the fact that the vast majority of the music is done on string instruments, including the cello, guitar, viol, and even the Swedish nyckelharpa. It really goes to show the range of these instruments, providing for a very nice soundtrack that also helps to make the experience that much more engaging.\n\n[*][b]Top-notch optimization.[/b] It looks fantastic and runs well — that's really all we need — and A Plague Tale does exactly that.\n\n[*][b]Seamless story-gameplay transitions.[/b] As this is a story-driven game, there are plenty of cutscenes and dialogue sequences scattered throughout. Normally, one would consider these an interruption to the actual gameplay, but here in Plague Tale, these transitions are seamless. I would be watching a cutscene for a couple minutes, then suddenly find myself in control of the character, despite there being seemingly no transition. It also works in the reverse, with gameplay also giving way to cutscenes. The game doesn't do this for every cutscene, but it does so enough that it never really feels like the story is interrupting the flow of the gameplay or vice-versa.[/list]\n\n[h1]Cons:[/h1]\n[list][*][b]Lackluster ending.[/b] While I may have praised the story overall, it unfortunately does falter in the last couple chapters. I'm going to avoid spoilers, but I will say that the lead up to that point is nice, but the pacing just ramps up way too quickly at the end, making for an ending that honestly just felt rushed. This seems to be a common trend in story-driven games like this, where it feels like the devs were burnt out and just wanted to wrap up the game. It's unfortunate really, as this puts a stain on an otherwise great story.\n\n[*][b]Gameplay issues.[/b] Given that this is a heavily story-focused game, I expected the simple gameplay, but even then, it does still have some problems. For example, one such issue is the game's constant reliance on introducing new ammo types in an attempt to shake things up. Throughout the course of the game, you're introduced to a variety of new ammo types to take care of different scenarios. One allows you to remove helmets from soldiers, another allows you to put out lit fires, and there's even one that allows you to temporarily attract rats to a specific area. These are all great in theory, but the game simply does not make use of most of them.\n\nMost of the time, it felt like the game would introduce one of these and have you go through a level designed to make use of it, but after that, its use would be very limited. At that point, some new ammo type would be introduced to take its place. It really felt like the devs were trying to make the gameplay appear more complex than it actually is, when they really didn't need to.\n\nAside from that, I also didn't like how much of the game's stealth sections felt like they were being recycled from level to level. Even if the scenery changed, some of these segments could really just be plopped down in any level and there would be hardly any difference compared to if it were put in another. Granted, this is a story-driven game with relatively simple gameplay, but even then, it's pretty hard not to notice it.\n\n[*][b]Incredibly stupid AI.[/b] It's pretty much tradition at this point for stealth games to have some incredibly dumb AI and Plague Tale is no exception. It hits all of the marks, including NPCs patrolling in stupid patterns, not noticing you when you're right next to them, and even the classic ""oh, it's probably nothing"" when looking at the now-dead body of one of their comrades. It doesn't impact the story directly, but it does make me feel like I'm up against a bunch of idiots.[/list]\n\n[h1]Overall:[/h1]\nWhen it comes to story and aesthetic, A Plague Tale: Innocence pretty much nails it. Excellent graphics, great voice acting, a good soundtrack, and a story that's both interesting and immersive. It does falter towards the end and does have some gameplay issues all throughout, but it was a great experience overall and one that I would easily recommend to those that are into story-driven games. It's rare that we get such a nicely polished singleplayer experience like this and I hope to see more from the studio in the future.\n\nFollow my [b][url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/3215371]Steam Curator Page[/url][/b] for more reviews + videos!",Recommended
"Anyone  going into A Plague Tale: Innocence should have the expectation that this is a stealth game at heart. \n\nIt is a wonderful, carefully crafted 1300's setting that oozes with atmosphere which sucks you in right from the beginning with the two unfortunate main characters, Amicia and Hugo.\nThe game runs splendid on my GTX 970 (Feel free to ask me any further questions about that)\nYou take control of Amicia, a young girl, beautifully voice acted, who alongside her sick little brother is being chased by the inquisition after a plague has broken out. \n\nThe majority of the game revolves around working together with your brother and other characters you meet later on with their own interesting little personalities. You'll be sneaking around mostly linear levels, distracting guards to create paths forward, doing light puzzles that involves manipulating the enviroment to avoid the plague rats and occasionally going off the beaten path, usually a room or a road that can lead to quiet moments where you explore more of the sibling's chemistry. Through the adventure you will find and pick up resources that can either be used to craft throwable items that'll get you past many of the game's road blocks, or they can be used to upgrade your limited gear, reduced noise, expanded pouch, longer lasting effects, etc. There are also collectibles to be found for those interested.\n\nDue to the lack of combat, I was afraid that it would be one of those games I would have to force myself through and take long breaks from, but I am pleased to say that it is extremely well paced, and the story kept me coming back to see how it would unfold.\nMany are probably gonna hold off on buying this gem until it becomes cheaper due to its linear nature and an average playtime of 12 hours. That's obviously a subjective thing and is gonna varie from person to person. Personally, I haven't changed much since the old Playstation 1 days where we bought 4 hour games for 60 bucks.

"Excellent visuals, music, plot, and game mechanics. It was apparent how committed the developers were to making this game the best it could be and I hope I see more from them in the future.",Recommended
"Story: A plagues Tale story is based in France back in time of the Plague. You play a female character who has been charged to find a cure for her brother who’s is sick. But while doing this she n her brother have to avoid the Inquisition. Who are after them as their leader wants the said brother. Its thrilling, its intense, its pulling at even my feels. This all happens when the plague is rampaging through France lots of rats!\n\nThe Graphics: With the game not long being out the graphics are amazing looking especially on my system. I was impressed. Even in the different times of day it looked amazing from the sun light coming through the trees. During the night the light from the fire torch and even the moon light. They definitely worked on this to make it feel really good.\n\nGame play: Game play is great. It suits the time line and environment. It go's from calming to intense to then worrying. You have work benches in the game which allow you to improve your sling and to allow you to carry more ammo etc. You can learn extra skills to help you along the way. Like extinguish which puts out fires. Which then obviously kills the light which in situations allows you to use the rats to your advantage. You can even find collectibles in the game if you are that inclined to that side. The game does have you needing to concentrate at times with judging timing. Which al admit I do suck at times. Yeah death count was high but did have me laughing at it tho.\n\nControls: They are easy to learn nothing to difficult at all. All I can say on this.\n\nThe Music: The music fits the time frame of the game, the story and the environment. It carries you gently along, then hooks you and pulls through intense scenes it adds to he feel you pick up from the characters and the situations going on around you the character. \n\nThe Reply Value: There certainly is if you want to relive the story which is good or hunt for the collectibles. But nothing major to gain extra from what I see.\n\nBug/Glitches: Nothing I could see at all to cause concern not CTD's no backwards flying dragons. Joking on that. Nothing at all.\n\nOverall: A Plagues Tale is one amazing game. It hooked my interest from the name at first then the trailer with Sean Bean and the game trailer. I had to have it. Snatched it and loved the story amazing intense heart pulling. It was a great story to go through. The games graphics amazing for a 2019 game they had me going oh thats nice in a certain voice style. They made the game fit perfectly to the story timeline they was working on. The game-play as said is great works with the story environment etc extremely well. They defo worked hard on this. Controls easy plain as. The music oh man it is epic works with the game fully and with the story it adds all that extra enough said on that. No replay really in my view except to redo the amazing story again. No bugs at all. So I give this game 10/10 paws and a golden Chainsaw! I defo advise getting this amazing game. I am sure you wont be disappointed.",Recommended
"I've waited to get 100% in the game before the review, since I was really into it. So I'll write my review without trying to spoil much.\n\nPros: Very good graphics, story telling was great, the soundtrack was marvelous, collectibles side story details also good (recommend to everyone that will play read the details of each item), puzzles were ""okay"" (since the game is pretty much story telling than gameplay itself, I didn't bother much to make a bad point out of it), gameplay also good and very wide open in variations that you can choose what to do in each chapter. Also heavily recommend to play in ""immersive mode"", that will make a lot difference from playing it normal\n\nCons: Sometimes the A.I will glitch, for it did glitch a lot of times don't know why. But that's nothing really bad, just annoying to restart at the checkpoint. The gameplay itself sometimes gets boring, because it repeats itself, even if you're in a different area... A little sad too that the actual ""combat"" doesn't exist in the game, since it's pretty much stealth and exploring the area to find the items for upgrades and collectibles. \n\nConclusion; The game itself really is worth its value, I did hesitate when I saw the price but it was really worth. I do recommend to buy it without waiting for a promo or something else. But if you're not into story telling and willing to explore the area for achievements or upgrades for your items, probably it's not your game.\n\nVisual - 9/10;\nStory telling - 9/10;\nGameplay - 7/10\nSoundtrack - 9/10\nCharacter develop - 8/10\n",Recommended
"This game has caught my interest due to the dark and mysterious setting as well as the promise of a meaningful plot with interesting characters. So can ""A Plague Tale: Innocence"" live up to those expectations?\n\nThe main plot is set up in a very mysterious way. This game paints a brutal picture of the reality under war and the plague in medieval times which makes the game feel very immersive. I really enjoyed the mood this sets, the feeling that something dark and sinister is going on is always looming. That's why the resolution of the plot in the end is even the more disappointing. It feels like the game is setting up a dark twist that never happens. This makes the end feel rushed, despite the fact that 10+ hours of gameplay are completely fine for a singleplayer game. I couldn't help but wonder ""That's it?"" after the final boss fight. While the overall plot is resolved for the characters, the overarching theme that keeps the game interesting isn't.\n\nOverall I felt pretty indifferent to the characters introduced throughout the plot. The dynamic between the two main protagonists is the best one but even there it didn't feel like a lot of development was made.\nMaybe it's also due to the fact that we don't spend a lot of time with any of these characters but when some of them inevitably die, it doesn't feel as dramatic or heartbreaking as the game makes it out to be.\n\nI also have my gripes with the gameplay. Overall it's a very solid stealth game. However, most of it feels like a tutorial to me. You learn new abilities throughout the game and then have to pass a challenge involving said new ability. This feels like a tutorial section designed to set you up to use this new gameplay element by yourself in the future - but often it wouldn't even come up anymore. This makes the solution of puzzles often trivial because you know exactly which ability to use to solve it. All in all most of the game feels like a setup to a large gameplay sequence in which you're free to use all of your abilities without the game holding your hand but that never happens.\n\nSo all in all I sadly can't recommend this game. I enjoyed the dark and mysterious setting as well as some character moments between the two main protagonists but overall the main story and characters as well as the gameplay fall short. It's certainly worth checking out on sale but I wouldn't recommend it at the current price tag.",Not Recommended

Best thing I've played in a long time",Recommended
"Gameplay over storytelling - it can ruin a game...(no spoilers)\n\n...luckily it didn't in this game, but there are moments in the last chapter where the game, trying to tell what is evidentally meant as the emotional highpoint of the game, struggled in my honest opinion.\n\nI mean specifically some of the fights through this chapter and the very last fight. The combination of the sometimes sluggish camera and aiming, which also tends to have a will of it's own, the fact that the game does not slow down when you change between amunition types and Amicia then getting killed when there's only one mistake, made for very, very frustration sections, which I had to play over and over again.\n\nIt takes you right out of the moment and then again and then again and then again. Fighting in general is not the strenght of the game, but maybe that makes sense, because the main protagonist, Amicia, simply isn't build to fight heavily armored knights with brute force. But she often outsmarts her enemies, or sneaks around them and uses the environment to trick them into situations where she has the upper hand through the many tools she has up her sleeve. And those are the gameplay elements the game is simply great in. \n\nFor the most part though I played this for the excellent, propulsive story and the characters, though the ""band"" is not as fleshed out as Amicia and her brothers. But still, this was the thing that drove me further until the very end.\n\nAnother strongpoint of the game is the graphics. Asobo uses an in-house-engine to surprising results. Screenshots really don't do it justice, videos fare better, but you really have to see the beautiful (and often dark, both in daylight and tone) scenery, the brilliant lighting and the many details they bring to life...and death. ^^ I didn't like that the game tends to stutter whenever new parts of the level are loaded in during live gameplay - there only loading screnes between the larger chapters - but that's something they might even adress in a future update. I know I'm not the only one, since Digital Foundry also mentioned them in their graphical analysis.\n\nI love this game, I really do. It is easily my personal game of the year and I never actually saw it coming, it was ""under the radar"" so to speak. But I hope for the sequel Asobos developers have a closer look at game sections like those towards the very end and then make better decisions on what's more important and on which to focus: Storytelling or gameplay. But please not both at the same time, in a matter that one disrupts the other. Thank you in advance. \n\nAnd from the bottom of my heart, thank you even more for this heartwarming, beautiful game! :)",Recommended
Good story.,Recommended
"I can't remember the last time I was this immersed into a game. It has beautiful graphics, amazing music, and quite possibly the best voice acting I've heard. It has a fantastic narrative that plays out over several linear chapters.\n\nThe game is very linear, that's Recommended, but it does not suffer from it, rather it takes advantage of the format. There is absolutely no grinding, no repetitive sidequests or boring traveling towards a quest marker. In every minute of the game the story and characters are allowed to shine.\n\nThe gameplay focuses on stealth from human enemies, and puzzles centered on rat swarms and getting around them by using light sources. The difficulty of puzzles felt just right to me, they need a bit of thinking but you won't have to look up guides online to progress.  Stealth is somewhat simplified - for example guards standing still looking in a direction will never look to the sides or behind them, unless provoked - but it's still fun because the game gives you a lot of tools in how you can distract and manipulate guards.\n\nThe writing is really good and the game is paced very well.  It's a dark story but with plenty of heartwarming moments. Also, we've seen rat swarms before, but this time they're actually scary.\n\nOverall this is a fantastic experience well worth the price. We could really do with more games like this in these days.\nThis is a lonely game holding a torch of storytelling and immersion surrounded by a swarm of repetitive empty world live services.",Recommended
"Quite simply a masterpiece of Story Telling in the video game medium. \n\nAn excellent cast with excellent voice acting ( I know people have said choose French but I thought the English was amazing and I don't like subtitles)\n\nGraphically always excellent sometimes mindblowingly so \n\nThe game play is simple for the most part but effective and fun.\n\nInstantly one of my favorite games of all time.\n\nMy ONLY complaint is towards the end your skills need to be used MUCH quicker than during the greater part of the game. This led to some frustration as my mind/hands got used to the quicker actions. However, the parts where I got annoyed, instant death, were overcome mostly quickly and with a satisfying feeling.\n\nI believe most gamers won't have my issue but I was using a controller which I'm much worse with then a KM (Wanted to kick back on the couch).\n\nAnyways incredible game worth every penny if not more.",Recommended
"Still can't get over how beautiful this game is. Character development, level design and original soundtrack are extremely delightful. Thank you Asobo Studio, you've genuinely touched my heart.",Recommended

"Would not recommend. You can't turn off auto aim, the mouse sens while aiming can't be adjusted to match the rest of the games sensititvity, and the game devs think you are retarded. Super linear, hardly any challenge, and the puzzles which are ridiculously easy are complemented by an inner voice telling you the whole 2 step process while you are doing them. Movement is crap. Fights are annoying, and there is just one super obvious way to do everything. Meh",Not Recommended
"What a fantastic adventure!  A Plague Tale is not brilliant when it comes down to gameplay. The game flow is VERY linear, there is very little to find off the road, the areas are mostly small and tight and Plague Tale never leaves doubts about where it wants you to go next. And whenever the game senses that you might be stuck somewhere, it won't hesitate giving you a hint on what to do next. A Plague Tale is also not about challenges. The very few boss fights will hardly make you sweat, and if they do, then mostly because the controls are well optimized for sneaking, but not so much for fighting. \n\nHowever, the dark story, the very likable characters, the most beautiful medieval settings and graphics, the very fitting soundtrack, the good voice acting in sum totally make up for the rather mediocre gameplay mechanics. Also it is a pretty new experience for me to play as a teenage girl who ain't no super hero at all, but dies at the first hit. Most always holding her little brothers hand, doing everything that it takes to protect him. This character combination is so well performed and heart warming that you can easily adopt the kids feelings of hope, despair, fear or happiness. They did a fantastic job at Asobo Studios. \n\nOn the technical side, Plague Tale is solid, but has a few issues still short after release. Most notable are textures that seem not to load into the GPU memory fast enough so you occationally may see white flickers when rotating the camera fast. Also I often noticed FPS drops. What they also should fix urgently is the missing ingame option to disable chromatic aberration which is enabled by default. An eye-cancer favoring crap setting that should have never been invented. I really wonder why game developers would actually want to spoil the visuals of their games with such an awful unsharpness effect, and to turn it off you need to edit the \Documents\My Games\A Plague Tale Innocence\ENGINESETTINGS file and set ""Fringe"" to 0. This will let you experience the beautiful graphics in a way that you and the game deserve.",Recommended

This is the game that I am really honestly so amazed at and impressed by even more so because it wasn't made by studio that I hadn't heard of or seen a lot of, but has really create fantastic and unique atmosphere and  the detail makes it even more impressive to play and get sucked into. If you enjoy dark, depressing, interesting and creative stealth-like rpg with a rich and unique story, then this is honestly a single player game worth investing your money in.",Recommended
"A Plague Tale Innocence is shockingly good.\n\nIf you’re reading reviews you already have a sense of what the game is about but you may have some of same reservations I did before clicking “purchase”, so here’s my thoughts:\n\nBuy it.  If you like atmosphere, narrative, memorable characters and setting, and don’t need or want every game to be as mechanically challenging as Dark Souls or as big as Ubisoft The Game, there’s a lot to love here.  It’s not terribly long, but it’s already priced 25% less than typical AAA.  I’m 10 hours in, about 2/3rds of the way through.  I already got my money’s worth.  At least wishlist it ;)\n\nIt’s stunningly beautiful and runs great (on my 1070).  Nothing about this game looks indie.  I’ve seen some people complain about the controls but it all seems very fluid to me, never died because my character did something I didn’t intend.  I don’t usually like straight stealth games, but fortunately after the beginning sections it gives you tools so that being spotted isn’t always insta-death. The tools are simple but fun.  Lots of hair raising moments and narrow escapes.\n\nThe rats are AMAZING.  I care about these characters a lot.  I keep wanting to know more about them and this world.  It’s just good, and the developers should be applauded for delivering such a beautiful, polished world and experience.  Even the soundtrack is perfect.\n\nAnyway, gotta get back to tricking Inquisition guards into being devoured by rat swarms. Trying to save a sick kid and all.",Recommended

For a casual player like me it took less than 20 hours to finish it. \nI really recommend playing it with immersive HUD settings. It doesn't make the game much more difficult, but will help to ""feel it"". \n\nPROS:\nGreat, engaging story\nExcellent music\nFine graphics\nIntuitive controls\n\nCONS:\nToo short\nReally minor bugs like some of the voice acting in the cut scenes disappears (pausing the game seems to help).\n\nI strongly recommend it. \n",Recommended

"So just finished this game at the time of writing this review and I got one word on this game. ""EXCELLENT"".\n\nPros:\n1. Unlike other games with an AI for a companion where you have to babysit them, this is one of those few games where your AI companion is not dumb and rushes to their own demise.\n2. Stealth mechanic in this game is great. Difficulty wise its fair.\n3. Decent storyline.\n4. Decent characters, definitely not as good as Kara and Alice's bond(Detroit become human) but still decent in its own way.\n5. Puzzles are fair.\n6. RATS. Lots and lots and lots of rats. For those of you who have a rat-phobia, do pick this up *grin*.\n\nCons:\n1. Although I did say the AI in this game is not dumb, there are however very very very rare occasion where your AI will stand in the open and reveal themselves thus alerting the enemies.\n2. Infuriating final boss.\n\nOverall gameplay wise I would give it 8.5/10.\n\nThat said, this game is kind of overprice for a 10 hour game (This includes me afk for several minutes as well as dying several times). I usually give a game a thumbs down if its overall playtime does not match its price but I give this game an exception. Whether you wanna spent USD$40 for a 10 hour game or not is up to you but I definitely give this game a thumbs up.",Recommended

The close combat does not work, I literally shouted ""what is this?! SEKIRO??!"" but not in a fair manner. Well, you will only fight in close combat maybe like twice throughout the entire game so no need to worry too much. The puzzle on the other hand, works well, and you have many ways to solve them.\n\nThe graphics is simply beatiful, no comment on that. \n\nOverall, 8/10, I recommended it!

If this game were a movie, I'd recommend it to everyone I know, but I can't recommend the game as it is to anyone, and I have absolutely no desire to replay it myself.",Not Recommended

This game is simply fantastic. Never seen such a believable and professional voice acting before. Controls as well as the graphichs are fine.,Recommended
"This game does not care what you think of it.  To wit: it kills a dog, in graphic fashion, in the first three minutes.  That's all the longer I've played, but I do not get any sense that the rest of the game will be any happier.  Which is fine.  You need misery sometimes. \n\nWould get depressed and lose faith in any existential purpose whatsoever again/10.  :(",Recommended

"This is an amazing game, from the gorgeous visuals to the amazing story line or it's combat and craft system; it is a [b]must buy [/b] . The facial expressions aren't 100% when you're running or sneaking or fighting and have some dialogue, but that's a very small ""con"" and this is only during game play, during cut scenes the facial expressions are great. The only thing I do regret is once I finish the game I will never be able to experience the same feelings I felt while playing this master piece. 10/10 game, very highly recommend.\nPS: I bought the DLC with out even knowing and I don't regret it one bit. This game deserves every cent I paid.",Recommended
"An amazing game that understands how to tell a great story with the backdrop of mystery and action necessary to keep a gamer entertained. This story was filled with wholesome moments, breathtaking scenery, fear, intrigue, and mystery. I understand if some people see the action as repetitive, but I felt that with each chapter difficulty increased and complexity of world interaction increased, not to say the game ever became an unplayable challenge. \n\nIf you're staying away from the game because of the price point in relation to the length of the game, I suggest not doing that. In a gaming world that is becoming increasingly dominated by corporate greed and a necessary sequel year following year, it's refreshing to have an independent studio releasing masterpieces like this. Buying the game will allow the studio to stay alive and create more artwork for us to appreciate in the future.\n\nIf I did have a bone to pick with this game it would probably be the length, but seeing as I didn't collect everything and explore everything I could have the first play-through, I'll probably be replaying it. \n\nI'd love to see dlc or a sequel if it could live up to this game. This game is a definite recommendation to everyone.",Recommended
"Very Deep And Moving Story, Great Gameplay.",Recommended
"Not half as repetitive as reviews had me believe. The game suffers from slight (only slight) responsiveness issues with mouse & keyboard, much as most basic console ports do, but nothing that you won't get used to in a small amount of time.\n\nAs a whole, it's a different, very endearing experience. You come to actually care about the characters and the story, and the game really manages to pull you in like few games have in a very long time. The soundtrack, excellent voice acting, and simple but fun game play mechanics made playing feel comfortable and entertaining from start to finish. And I for one found it a very welcome change to play a well written, even if linear story with steady and comfortable progression in this age of massively grindy open world games.\n\nI really wish we get more stuff like this in the future.",Recommended

"This game has a strong ""The Last of Us"" vibe when you play it. It's a bit shorter than the former, but it's overall an enjoyable experience. Do not expect too much from the gameplay though (except around the end of the game), since this is mainly for the story, the characters and the visual experience than you should acquire this title.\n\nWhen I started playing, I thought it was another AAA game by a big studio, but only later did I realise that it was actually a not so well known studio that produced this. This game is way better than The Witcher 1 and Uncharted 1 in my opinion, even tough it doesn't reach the level of depth of The Last of Us and other similar games.\nStill, an incredible game for a first try.",Recommended
"Longer than one might think for such a story-driven game, with more variation in gameplay than I'd expected from the trailers, it's also a very gripping storyline with capable graphics and a cool setting. It's not a game you'll play over and over again, but it's well worth a buy!",Recommended

"Great game. Excellent story. Excellent game mechanics. The $60 price point almost threw me off for a 10hr game, but after playing the game I'm glad I bought it and I think the price point is reasonable for the experience. On just the fact that this game was made by a relatively unknown studio that really has nothing like it in its portfolio, AND they developed there own engine, AND is performs spectacularly, they deserve to charge $60 for a 10hr game. An amazing amount of work, and love must have been poured into this game from all the different teams. Story, script, and character developers did an amazing job. One of the final levels where you play as another character will go down as one of my favorite gaming experiences.",Recommended
"A Plague Tale: Innocence is the best game I have played in 2019. It's a game with gorgeous graphics, realistic but pleasing environments, interesting characters, and most important of all, a thrilling and emotional 8-12 hour story. The story follows Amicia and Hugo through France in the 14th century, right when the plague starts. It's not just a normal plague, as you will find out when you meet antagonists and companions throughout the chapters. Some critique this game as a baby sitting simulator, but I think that Hugo's dependency on Amicia is a strong point in the game. In terms of gameplay, the game is pretty standard, the stealth is definitely not great here. The main mechanic of the game, the sling, is really satisfying though, and as the story progresses you unlock more types of ammunition. Then there's also the rats, which avoid the light but are dangerous in the shadows. You will learn how to use the rat infestation to your advantage.\n\nOverall, this game is easily a 9/10. PC performance has been good from day 1, and there's a lot of settings. The only reasons I don't rate it 10/10 are because:\n\n1) The game is pretty short for its price (only 8-10 hours for a normal playthrough, maybe 12-15 if you really wanna get all collectibles).\n\n2) Certain visual effects (DOF, Chromatic Abberation, Vignette) can't be disabled in-game but must be disabled through editing a config file in the game's directory.",Recommended

"Ok this is great. The only game I could really compare this to is The Last of Us, as it's the most complex of the Naughty Dog games and also relies heavily on stealth. This game is at the same level in my mind, the graphics are great, the animation, the acting, all great. I was dreading that it was about escorting your little brother, I don't really like children in media as they normally amp up the annoying factor by 12, but this game does not do that. Hugo does some stupid stuff in the story, but it's so infrequent it's more showing the player he's a kid rather than being an annoying jerk. It adds to the story, it isn't detrimental to gameplay. The AI is smart most the time, every once in a while it did something stupid for me but that was like 3 times an entire playthrough, which is entirely acceptable. \n\nThere are supernatual elements to the story, when I saw the first gameplay reveal I thought it'd be more realistic/historical, but it's well written so it's good in my books. Story is good.\n\nIt honestly feels like a Sony type exclusive came to PC, but is more technical in some ways compared to some of those. If you enjoy narrative games with some ok stealth and the same type of scavenging from The Last of Us and the risk/reward of using ammo as upgrades kinda like metro, Grab it. I got it with a gift card but I'd pay full price.\n\nAlso no mtx and no pointless grind with copy pasted content spread out across an empty open world, which is unusual in the current gaming climate.",Recommended

"An amazing action-adventure, heavily focused on stealth+puzzle gameplay, but even more on its characters (all of whom are likeable or, when it comes to the enemies, despicable) and their stories. It is mostly linear, with lots of nooks and crannies to explore and find secrets and thoughtful touches. \nIt plays really well, looks gorgeous and is well worth playing.",Recommended
"Very interesting and well written story, dialogs are great, facial animation is a little stiff...Gameplay is nothing that is worth nothing, but still kept me engage on some parts\n\n8/10 , very optimised.",Recommended
"Spoiler free. \nNUMBER ONE: Do you fear rats?\nI personally am not afraid of depictions of rats, I definitely would have an irrational terror if a real one jumped on me though. But going off my own fear gauge, this game did not scare me.\nNO ""JUMPSCARES"". That's a plus in my book. Any that sorta exist, I would call abrupt ""high tension"" moments.\nI definitely felt it was TENSE when they appeared and had to practically wade through them with my torch.\n\nNUMBER TWO: Horror vs Terror.\nThe game uses both horror and terror quite well at times.\nTHE HORROR-\nThere's lots, and I mean LOTS of dead bodies (human and animal). Lots of screams from people being eaten alive. Lots of humans being ""humans in a crisis"". And lots of rats (well, duh).\n\nTHE TERROR-\nImagine this: you are underground in a claustraphobic-ly small space in an maze (-which is small, but still). ALRIGHT. It is also pitch black and you have a torch that burns out after a few seconds. OK. . . AND there are also THOUSANDS OF RATS, and the ONLY thing keeping them back is that TORCH, which, by the way looks like it only has 3 SECONDS LEFT ON IT.\nThe unfortunate part is, only a few parts actually strike out to me as ""terrifying"", other parts fell a little due to the puzzles.\n\nNUMBER THREE: The puzzles.\nUnfortunately, the game loses some points from me by obligating puzzles. They are not even really puzzles, they are more like obstacles.\nHere's how a ""puzzle"" usually works. I walk into an area, ""oh no, we can't get to (x)"". I see the ""thing"" I need to move, break, etc. I ssssslowwwwwllllly do the thing. And then I move on.\nThe one way the puzzles work good is when 1: enemy npcs are involved and 2: you decide to not needlessly kill them by dropping rats on them. (and when the game allows you to do that)\nI LOVED when I had the option to clear an obstacle (sometimes rats), and not kill the enemies. It was challenging, and even if the devs gave me the clear and obvious way to clear the area of guards, I could sometimes sneak past without killing any of them. Near the end though, it becomes impossible to not kill the majority of people. \nYou only start out INNOCENT.\n\nNUMBER whatever:\nThe acting was what you'd expect from a ""middle market"" game. Decent, but no (A+)'s being given out.\nI also was left wondering what exactly the rats were and had some other story-related issues.\nI felt that during some sections (puzzles mostly), the rats were delegated as just ""the area of the floor you can't walk on"", without being consistent as a mass of living things. Like, why were the rats over ""there"", but not ""here"" as well? The puzzles cheapened the rat's horrifying quality a bit.\nI didn't have much issue with the stealthing everywhere, it lends itself to a horror game.\nI felt that many supporting cast deaths were unjustified, and would have liked to have found solutions, rather than being railroaded into watching the characters get all teary eyed when I was thinking ""boy, I sure would have liked to clear this obvious hazard before we slowly walked down the corridor. But noooo. the devs had to make ""x"" invincible this ONE SINGLE TIME.""\n\nCONCLUSION\nThis game is middle-market. Don't go in expecting a flawless masterpiece, it has low points and questionable story beats. But it definitely had high-points for me, about 2/3rds of the way through had an amazing story moment and the occasional terrifying location throughout.",Recommended
"I'd really like to rate this game well.  It's a good attempt at a story-driven RPG, but let down at every single turn by poor game mechanics, bad pathing, walking-for-the-sake-of-walking, and other terrible, boring tropes of the rpg genre.  The only thing missing is fetch quests - from hyper unrealistic 'crafting as excuse for upgrades' to 'forced walk pace to raise tension' to 'making you walk through every part of an area to milk extra value from the scenery' by guard placement, adding 'collectibles' everywhere etc.  The stealth aspects are underwhelming compared to any actual stealth game, and generally single-path at most - the third time you throw a rock at a bunch of pots and pans someone has left hanging in the middle of nowhere, exactly where you need to get by a guard also standing there for no real reason in a weird spot with a weird viewing angle, you'll be bored by it.  You need to get by rats?  Someone left a bunch of fires hanging by connecting rings and piles of sticks-that-can-be-used-as-torches next to them.  Not at random - there are exactly enough to get you to the door you need to get to and no more.\n\nNPCs often stare weirdly at nothing - their pathing is odd and often off.  Whenever the game wants you to turn left to not die or something, it's easy to get lost as they fail to signpost it - 'luckily', there is rarely ever even a fake choice as to where to go.  Combat is unwieldy at best, designed for two-stick controllers not keyboard and mouse (and not even great then) and the first forced instance of it involves some of the most hackneyed hit the boss in the weak spot design i've seen in quite a while.\n\nI just encountered my first game breaking bug.  The obvious next step is to light a fire with the 'ignifer' alchemy (it appears to be basically just oil?  or literally any other flammable, that you throw) to scare away the rats, to the point the game won't let you climb down the ladder (to death) unless the fire is lit and the rats are gone.  Problem?  You had to light two previous fires (the game literally tells you to via insistent npc) to progress to this point, and were given only two of these fire lighters.  You could craft another... if you had stockpiled enough of the saltpeter and oil this thing requires, by collecting optional pickups in the previous levels.  Which I did not.\n\nThe NPC says something about 'clearing the way' as you get there - perhaps he's meant to light it?  Who knows.  I certainly don't.  Nor, at this point, do I care.  What ultimately is going to happen to Amicia de Rune and her brother Hugo?  What's the deal with Hugo's evil blood or whatever?  Certainly, the game creators don't want me to find out, having placed every possible tedium in my path to finding out.  I guess at some point i'll youtube it.  Or grit my teeth and play through the pulse-pounding enjoyment of monotonously completing the single path 'stealth puzzles' and lighting the single path fires of the 'scary rat scenes'.\n\nI mean hey, I can overlook weird unrealistic stuff like finding a tiny piece 'of leather' while walking past entire prepared hides and the tools to cut as many pieces as I like, crafting stuff at random tables literally metres away from guards who want to murder you, every single clay pot you find having the exact same shape and ornamentation, guards being posted in random places, people hanging up pots and rock on hung pot meaning time to go stare it at for 10 minutes, so on.  I can overlook some boring mechanics I don't have fun interacting with.  I can overlook some length padding where the game creators want me to twiddle my thumbs for ten minutes instead of doing something enjoyable with my spare time.  I can overlook NPCs repeating themselves 50 times both in cutscenes and also during the actual gameplay.  I can overlook bad pathing leading to npc hangup or weird interactions.  I can deal with dodgy controls that sometimes do things like cause you to break stealth and jump into open space because you weren't lined up just right with the wall you wanted to vault over, or that walk you around weirdly because controllers have sticks not mice and their port is at best 'ehhhh'.  But when you combine all that?  Nope.",Not Recommended
"This was a fantastic adventure, from start to finish! One of the few experiences I've actually taken the time to complete without getting caught up in playing other games at the same time and getting derailed (we all go through that I'm sure lol). I'm not going to go into any of the story elements here, so no need to worry about spoilers. I'll just be quick and to the point.\n\nIn terms of stability, I didn't encounter anything that soured things. No crashes, no snags/environment pieces that I could get stuck in, no audio issues -- nothing. It was quite refreshing to actually play a completed game on release (purchased on day one).\n\nThe graphics and scenery in the game are excellent! The audio and soundtrack are absolutely spectacular and matched well with the period and various settings.\n\nThe puzzles were pretty good. Not difficult, but a few made for a decent challenge. You're going to die alot, don't let that discourage you. The final fight was annoying, but only took 3 or 4 tries.\n\nAs far as the codex goes, this really disappoints me....well, I disappoint myself I guess lol. Sure, it's a linear action/stealth/adventure, but it does leave a bit of room for exploration and discovery. I explored THE CRAP out of this game, seriously, that's my typical play-style, but I still somehow managed to miss 3 Herbarium items, 2 Gifts and 9 Curiosities -- like, WHAT!? lol. Seriously, I looked pretty much in every nook and cranny possible and even backtracked too, when not in scenes that required blind running away from things or other scenes that for some reason prevent you from returning to. That's why my playtime might be slightly bit higher than the average. I'm definitely not a speedrunner...what's the point of doing such a thing on a first playthrough? It's a waste of money and time if you want my honest opinion. I don't understand those types. Not for this genre at least.\n\nIn any event, I definitely recommend this title and have been talking about it non-stop for quite some time. Asobo Studio did an amazing job and I can't wait for the sequel/DLC expansion(s) since there's still at least two or three factors that are yet to be tied-up neatly that leave questions and room for more story.

"A Plague Tale: Innocence is one of the best games I've played in years. It is solid, bug-free, an absolute feast for the eyes and imagination. What I mean by that last part is that it's a lineair game with great details in every map going all the way to places you can't even go. There's a sense of awe when you see a beautiful vista with a working windmill in the distance, and a mountain behind it with a tower on it, knowing it's there although you can't go to it. It brings back a nostalgic feeling, back to the era where every game didn't have to be open-world. There's more detail and atmosphere in one Plague map than there is in all Far Cry games combined.\n\nThis game is a must have. Every moment feels like it's epic. It's not one of those games where the protagonist only really reacts realistically during the tutorial -- where only the prologue is a cinematic wonder. In Plague, almost every enemy prompts a reaction from the children and the game never suddenly decides it's done with the suspense to then just throw boring problems at you that don't really make sense contextually (like in the TR games, where after an epic introduction suddenly every mountain is somehow paved with wooden planks to climb, and levers make contextually useless pillars spin -- I'm so done with those ""here's the next puzzle area!"" moments in games that make zero sense).\n\nA Plague Tale: Innocence is a work of passion from start to finish. A shear contrast with the game that came out at the same date: Rage 2. Plague reminds me that AAA gaming is dead. I haven't felt this good playing a game in years, except for the The Witcher titles and Kingdom Come: Deliverance.",Recommended

"This game was AMAZING! Seriously! Last game I played by Focus Home was Vampyr so I had my standards relatively low going in. Now this is probably in my top five games of 2019 so far. \n\nThe story is great. You play as a 14-15 year old girl named Amicia and a lot of the game revolves around her little brother Hugo who is 8 years old, maybe less. They react how children would, they bicker like children would, and they always don't make the best decisions as children often do. But that's what makes this game so good, the characters feel real and all have distinct personalities. The villains are intimidating as they should be, and there's plenty of character development to go around. Here are a few key things I really liked from the game.\n\n- The voice acting is great. Some people sound a little more ""forced"" with the French accents but nothing that turned me off.\n- The music score is incredible. It's full of scratchy and uneasy feeling violin chords to deep cello notes that really hit hard and give you a real feeling of despair.\n- Every chapter has something in it that will stick with you. 90% of this game is very dark, you will see things that will disgust you or make you want to look away.\n- The game consistently adds new mechanics as you progress. The beginning of the game feels pretty on rails but as you get more tools at your disposal the second half of the game opens up quite a bit and I felt more free to take things on as I see fit.\n- The graphics are great. The lighting is phenomenal and there were tons of times I had to stop and take screenshots or just take in the view. It's a gorgeous game.\n- Last but not least I have NEVER played a game quite like this. The rats act like water almost. And yes they don't look great up close but from the player perspective the waves of rats can be terrifying. And without saying too much I've never fought a final boss quite like this games final boss either. SO COOL!\n\nLiterally the only complaint I can think of is the facial animations, and I can't really even complain about those because everything else in the game is so great it doesn't even matter to me at that point.\n\nIf you're iffy about the price it wouldn't hurt to wait for a sale. Personally I'd say I got my money's worth. You pretty much pay 5 dollars for each hour of the game which in all honesty is worth it to me. Great job Focus Home!",Recommended

Game have it's charm, not super complicated, not challenging in any way, but story just touches you and keep you entertained until very end.\n  Each character in a game unique and deeply developed with their own feelings, fears, emotions and views. Story doesn't provide with expansive background story of each and one of them, but let you figure out their past through dialogues. \n  Music in a game is amazing, developers did a phenomenal job to fit it perfectly in a game and it allows to feel the game much more deeply and personal, feel that spectrum of different emotions from joy of staying alive up to fear of swarming sounds of rats.\n  Rats require some attention because they are one of the main things you will be dealing with this whole game. They are terrific, swarming around you and wait that last unlucky step in darkness. Best part is how they actually look in dark, like a black river of red eyes ready to consume any living being on their way. And how they sound! It's like a chorus of squeaks and movements of millions of little paws.\n  At the end I want to say that game is absolutely worthy to buy so you can experience yourself such amazing game (and to support devs of course), 12/10 and I can't wait to see if second part going to make it.",Recommended

"This used to be a largely negative review, despite the fact that I was enamoured with several aspects of the game, and its inherent potential, it ended up as a ""don't recommend"" title for me initially.\n\nAfter watching my hubby play through the game I was able to just experience the visuals, the story and the world kind of like a television series or a really long film..\n\nThis led me to love the game.\n\nThe graphics and visuals really are some of the absolute best I have seen.\n\nIf the developers learn from their mistakes and really tweak the skill system and fight mechanics for the sequel (I am really hoping for one), it could become some truly, truly extraordinary and special.\n\nOne is allowed to alter ones mind, no?\n\nI absolutely fucking adored it as a spectator. and because I had dealt with the really frustrating parts myself once before, I was able to aleviate most of it for my hubby by whispering sweet hints whenever needed, which allowed for a nigh perfect playthrough, which was a really great cinematic experience, and something, ultimately, only video game culture can provide these days.\n\nAs a stealth/action title, it is not good enough at all, but after falling in love with it after having watched the entire thing like a series, I just couldn't let my negative review sit there any longer, it didn't feel right. I still think that most gamers will be dissapointed by the core game aspects, but with more polish and planning from the developers, the next game could be superb, so I want it to have as much love as possible. \n\nthere you go.",Recommended

Backstories of each side character and companion,[spoiler] the war between the English and the invaders [/spoiler], and how the plague started would fill in gaps in the story.",Recommended
"A fantastic story and character driven sp game with great narrative and setting, this and hell blade are two of a few best sp games in recent years and would always recommend",Recommended
The graphics are impressive and is what got me interested in the game in the first place. The ambiance of every chapter is done very well. The fear and disgust of the characters were aptly portrayed through the music and art. Truly an immersive experience.,Recommended
"A linear story, good graphics, not so good animations, beautiful environment and amazing sound and voices (my favorite character is Hugo and his voice is beautiful!)\nIt was boring at times, however, I enjoyed it overall.",Recommended
"A Plague Tale: Innocence is a surprise to me. \n\nThe setting is inspired by history, and it is unique. The landscape and character designs are gorgeous and exquisite. The game looks like a long series of paintings. The music matches the story and settings perfectly. It might not be the most creative music compositions, but it helps make the game more immersive. \n\nThe story is intriguing but straightforward with great character portrays. You can tell the character development arcs throughout the story. The plot makes you care about Amicia, Hugo, and the sidekicks. The conflicts among characters are natural, and the decisions made by the characters also fit their age groups. The inner thoughts about Amicia are well-described. She is a naive and kind person. However, under extreme situations, she has to make difficult and even harsh decisions. She is not a perfect protagonist. Although she always tries to protect her brother Hugo, she does have fights with her brother occasionally. Killing is not an easy thing for her, and the story reflects well that Amicia feels guilty about all the murders that she has committed for Hugo's well-being. Hugo is cute and adorable. He behaves naturally like a five-year-old boy. He is full of curiosity, and he loves his mother and sister. Even though Hugo and Amicia are not very close to each other since Hugo has been quasi-quarantined for his entire life, the bound between grows stronger as the story goes on. The plot depicts the protagonist's mental reactions about killings better than many other games. Voices acting also match each character very well. I have played the story with voices of different languages, and they all sound top-notch. \n\nThe game mechanics are smooth, and there are no significantly noticeable bugs in the game. Personally, it is a straightforward and easy game. However, some players might find the gameplay to be restrictive. Amicia's weapons, her sling and alchemical stones, are fun to use. Especially considering I have been playing many games with guns, bows, and daggers as primary weapons, getting a chance of using slings and stones are refreshing to me. Later with Hugo's new talents, the combats become more fun. Still, the game design does not encourage john-wick-style fightings and killings. Most of the time, one hit can kill Amicia. In many scenarios, players can choose to let Amicia distract and bypass the enemies without eliminating them (more often in the first half of the game). Consistently, players have to make hard decisions on how to allocate the resources in an optimized way. The materials found can be used either to craft ammunition or to upgrade gears. The game gives you a lot of clues and holds your hands through. Therefore, you are constrained to travel in limited areas and make finite choices. The DLC only changes the main characters' outfits without additional game contents. So for players who enjoy new things and do not care very much about stories or graphics, the game might not have that much replay value. However, since I enjoy the landscape and character designs, the story, the music, and the weapons, I will probably play for a good number of times. \n\nSince I have not heard much about the game until I saw the commercial on steam last week, I did not put a very high expectation while purchasing the game. Nevertheless, the game is a surprisingly satisfying purchase to me. \n\nDue to my surprise, the rating I put can be a bit overrated:\n\nGraphics and Designs: 10 / 10\nAtmosphere: 10 / 10\nStory and characters: 10 / 10\nGameplay: 9 / 10 \n\nOverall: 9.75 / 10\n",Recommended
"I would alternate between saying I liked and loved the game, depending on the chapter. I loved the chapters that prominently featured Hugo; he's absolutely adorable, and his innocence offers a stark and interesting contrast to their situation.\n\nThere were a few moments where I was frustrated by the artificial difficulty, mostly near the end with the amount of stuff going on. \n\nThese small segments bothered me because I felt like I had to exploit a gimmick to get past them, or that the only way to learn that gimmick was to die several times first; you couldn't always reason your way to the solution (or I couldn't at least). In a story-driven game, I feel like my reaction time, or my ability to find a fix through trial-and-error, shouldn't be what the game is testing, and I occasionally felt like it was. \n\nOverall, though, compared with similar games I've played (video game movie is the best description I can come up with), I would put this on-par with Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice at a 9/10. It's equally memorable, and there were chapters that I loved so much that I'd call it a must-play for anyone who likes a good story.\n\nI appreciated the length; it didn't overstay its welcome. There was just enough story to get the details I wanted without feeling bogged down by a game length quota (thinking of recent Assassin's Creed games for example).",Recommended
"Wonderful story. \n\nLinear stealth gameplay, but it serves its purpose for one of the best narrative experiences I've ever played. \n\n10/10",Recommended
"Wonderful start, dreadful second half and an even worse ending. Like so many games and I never know why, took the weakest parts (movement and controls in my case), and makes them a core part of the game play. Terrible boss fights are never a way to win me over, and this one has 'em all over the place. When combine results in an infuriating time, would not recommend as is.",Not Recommended
"Although this game is just a fictional story, but it do remain me of my own reality. \nThe darkness inside of my mind is still hunting me constantly, if I showed one little cowardice, it will capture me then eat me just like the rats. \nDo you have someone to protect? Do you want to live a new life? Then you must fight, there's no rescue from others, you have to do it by yourself. It's your fate so accept it even in the deepest pain. How hard it would be? How scary it would be? How many failures you have already experienced? There always a way to break through, always.

"Single player game with rich story, unforgettable unique characters and a gameplay that involves ways to not getting into battle!! You play as a young girl so you die on one hit and you have to avoid battle altogether. Stealth and your sling are your best options. You can use your allies (Hugo, the little boy or other orphans you come accross) to get out difficult occasions.\n\nThe story is linear and has a sense like reading a nice book. It was a pleasure to play it from start to finish. Linear gameplay but I say it as a +. It is a single player story driven game, it has to be linear to tell its tale.\n\nA total must have if you are into this. An instant classic. Loved it altogether!!",Recommended
this game was really thought out and had good fighting mechanics. I really enjoyed the story and I had to stop playing between sessions to breathe and to eat. :),Recommended
"A truly amazing game, the gameplay is quite basic but the aventure is well paced and it's a jewel to the eyes. Voice acting are on point (french version is very good).\n\nIf you like narrative games in credible worlds, this is a game that worth the shot, even more if you can get it on sale",Recommended
"There is so many great aspects about the game, the remarkable story, the likable characters, the breathtaking visuals that could be compared to the best looking AAA games, and even the stealth that doesn't feel boring unlike most other games, A Plague Tale: Innocence is a Recommended gem of a game. \n\nUsually I find myself yearning for a really good singleplayer narrative experience to balance out the multiplayer games, and I do not regret paying $45 for this game. I beat it at around 9.5 hours, I thought that it was a good length for the asking price, not everyone would agree with that. While some of the gameplay is a bit wonky, primarily the sling in general just feeling awkward to use, it doesn't take away from the experience. I ran into only a few bugs, some of which could've been game breaking if there wasn't an easy fix around it, but other than those I rarely had any issues with my experience playing the game. I really did enjoy the game, so much so that my hours were split between 2 days, I usually never do that unless I'm obsessed with the specific game. \n\nI've never heard of Asobo Studio until this game released, but knowing that they can put out quality games like this one, I'm curious to see what their next project will be when the time comes. Personally, I think A Plague Tale: Innocence would greatly benefit from DLC expansions, maybe playing as someone else, maybe Melie, but I think it's a fair possibility.\n\nIf you are on edge about buying it, just buy it already, it really is a great game. We need to show AAA publishers like EA that singleplayer games are not going anywhere anytime soon.\n\nEdit: I found out about the article that explains the developers intentions for A Plague Tale: Innocence, and it saddens me that a game like this will not be receiving any DLC or sequels.

The voice actors are superb. I really like Amicia and her progress changed through out the story.\nReally like it, hope there will be a second one.\n\nP.S: The last boss fight checkpoint is kinda....annoying, so get ready",Recommended
"This game is better than your average under 60$ game. Great story, gritty setting and atmosphere, great graphics, mediocre but very acceptable gameplay. I am very pleased with it. My only two issues with it are lack of native 21:9 support and sli support cuz even a single 2080ti is not enough to play this at 3440x1440 with supersampling.",Recommended
"A Plague Tale is more of an experience than a game. I would compare it to playing Tell Tales The Walking Dead Season 1 when it first came out. The story keeps you wondering what will happen next and you gain a connection to most of the characters. The gameplay is fine but it's not really the main attraction. For most of the game you just gotta throw some rocks and sneak around, although later on one of the big game mechanics is completely flipped around which leads to some interesting moments. A lot of the game is just taking in the atmosphere of the world due to the graphics, music and audio doing an amazing job at immersing you into this universe. One thing the game could have done better is conveying hopelessness or desperation, I never really felt like everything was going to end badly for the characters which did take away from the over all experience. Apart from a couple of annoying gameplay moments I cant really come up with anything else bad with this title. \n\nIf you are looking for a linear experience that keeps you hooked than this is a must play. 10/10 experience 6.75/10 gameplay",Recommended

"A Plague Tale: Innocence is a brilliant linear story-based experience that I absolutely adored. The interactions between Amicia and Hugo are excellently written and the voice acting is absolutely excellent. I've no clue how Asobo managed to make such a beautiful lighting engine, but A Plague Tale is probably the best looking PC game I've ever played. The sheer amount of detail on Amicia's hair and face is simply mind-boggling (her hair is the most realistic I've ever seen in a game), and Hugo is equally detailed. \n\nIf you have 45 dollars to spare, play this game immediately. It's an experience worth having.",Recommended
"Just finished the game, I loved it. The story was great and the atmosphere really intense.  The gameplay was pretty unique and not repetitive at all. The game mechanics change quite a bit during the progression of the story.",Recommended
"Awesome game definitely worth the money. \n\n-Great and decent length story \n-Good mechanics\n-Little puzzles (I'm not really a puzzle person so this was good for me)\n-Creative game (attacking, alchemy, etc)\n\nThis didn't bother me too much but occasionally the AI would mess up. Checkpoints are at very good areas so you never have really ""restart"" a level if you happened to die.\n\nThis is primarily a stealth game. Your character is weak she dies almost instantly to anyone with a weapon. If you are not okay with these game mechanics then I do not recommend. It takes some getting used to but once learned the game is very fun.\n",Recommended
Raw. Emotional. Amazing game! heavy story driven but that is a breath of fresh air in a market flooded by games with no substance and generic copy and paste stories. Awesome job from a small studio!!,Recommended

"Great Game! Excellent characters, situations, and game play. Goes downhill a bit at the end when the game play switches from stealth-focused to combat-focused, but not enough to distract from the overall quality. I hope they make a sequel or DLC following Melie's story. Probably shouldn't play it if you've got a rat phobia, though.",Recommended
Setting aside the copious amount of frame stuttering this is an amazing game with beautiful visuals and charming characters. The story is by no means extensive but is nicely written with a good number of twists along the way. A great soundtrack fits the dark tone of the game very well. If you can put up with some technical issues then you won't regret the purchase,Recommended
"This game is one of kind just like HELLBLADE was but with its OWN TWISTED TWIST, in this world where open-world microtransactions games brainwashed the major audience out of a Recommended original experience like this one & the other i mentioned. You don't know what you loose as a gamer if you give this one a pass. In essence if HellBlade was about oppresion this game is about desperation & the horrors of LUST i won't give any spoilers away but lets say that until the end of the game where the FEVER GREW TO THE MAXIMUM for the epic & satisfying  ending , you will have  multiple moments where your gonna lean back take a breath & say : ""I CAN'T BELIEVE THEY DID THAT"". To sum it up A PLAGUE TALE is this years HELLBLADE, but that dosen't mean they are the same animal ... they just have the  same  HEART invested in every pixel,sound & line of dialogue you encounter !",Recommended
"I just finished the game and WOW! Just WOW!. There are only good things to mention as far as the game and the story is concerned.\n \nGraphics are just outright gorgeous; the characters and the landscapes are visually breathtaking. Add the beautiful story to this, and you get a sweet linear tale compared to the open world games you see these days. So this is a nice refresh from everything I’ve played so far. I would have personally preferred a bow and an arrow over a sling, but it’s just personal preference. Although a sling matches Amicia’s personality better, so it makes sense. \n\nThe only area that could improve as far as my eyes can see is the facial animations (won’t bother you though). \n\nSo TLDR then, this is a must play and trust me you will love the game (10/10). Looking forward to another release from this developer.",Recommended
"Let’s get to the point: this game is sooo good, and I would recommend it to anyone! Being new to stealth-type games, I found A Plague Tale: Innocence easy to pick up. The mechanics are complex yet simple learn. The story is fantastic, the musical score is masterful, and the characters are unforgettable. Do yourself a favor and invest spending the time playing this beautiful game. I give it a 9.5 out of 10!",Recommended
"Overall great story and characters - they will stay with you, even if you are too small to understand why (just kidding, this is LoTR quote, you will likely understand why). Gameplay is fun enough to keep it entertaining, but definitely not the highlight of the show. Please try it, it's a game made with love and there's not many of those out there lately",Recommended
"Just finished it in a weekend (taking it very slow).\nVery nice and good game, but way too expensive for such an short experience, if you just rush the story you probably finish it in one evening...\nWould have been top score if price would have been adjusted to it being super short and not having very deep game mechanics.\n\n5/10 because of overpriced",Recommended
I love it so much! Best game I've played so far!,Recommended

"Very well-made, but also extremely linear except for the first 30 minutes which are quite interesting with engaging NPC interactions and exploration. Then the handholding begins...\n\nI wish the developers had taken more time to flesh out their ideas in more open areas and greater emphasis on exploration and dialog. The mechanics for it are there, but they feel stilted by the linear levels and ultimately it plays more like a movie than a game.\n\nThe rat mechanic wears thin really quickly and is relied on too heavily.",Not Recommended
"Amazing game. The story gave me goosebumps and the graphics are perfect. You are in for one hell of a ride when playing this game. Yes it is a bit linear, but it is worth playing and I LOVE my indie games, this one being one of the best.

Will be spoken in the same breath as Hellblade' - is a pretty accurate description of this game.,Recommended
"If you are debating on this or Rage 2 , I highly recommend this game it's a cinematic story driven game and it's taking place during the plauge times. The gameplay mechanics is stealth and it can be a bit repetive  and bit over simplefied I hope its something they work on in a sequel but overall the good story makes up for it, it has great character development with Amicia and Hugo made me really feel for them.",Recommended

"If you have to pick between 'A Plague Tale: Innocence' and 'Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice', go with Hellblade.\n\nEverything 'A Plague Tale' does, 'Hellblade' does better.\n\nWhile the gameplay of 'A Plague Tale' is nice and challenging, the puzzles feel more like setpieces, as do the chapters and locations. The story itself made sense at first, but dropped the ball in the third act, when it became over the top ridiculous for the sake of adding a new gameplay element.\nThe game is indeed very good from a visual point of view, but you grow tired of the corpses strewn all around. Gore is just used for shock value and adds nothing to the story, which thus fails to stand on its own.\nSome locations seem just to be added to increase the average playtime. SPOILER: [spoiler]If the castle is created as a hideout with the ability to decorate it with the collectibles and locked off explorable areas, why do we only get to be there twice or three times? Also the mosaic in the central hall of the castle hinted at some sort of deeper meaning or maybe mystery concerning the courtyard, but in the end, it was a mosaic, nothing more.[/spoiler]\nThe rather lackluster perfomances don't help it either. I'm sure the voice actors gave it their all, but the emotions just do not translate to the faces which remain emotionless the entire time. Same goes for the body language during in-game dialogue. It's absolutely non existent.\nThe gameplay is very solid, but sometimes doesn't work with the speed of the situations that occur. The final bossfight and the [spoiler]sequence where Rodric pushes the cart as cover[/spoiler] are examples of this. You have to switch quickly between different ammunition types or targets and that's where the inventory system meets its limits, leading to mistakes like picking the wrong ammo because your stick was an angle off during choosing or forgetting to change ammo and thus wasting it in the process.\n\nOverall, I'd give this game a 5/10, which is disappointing, as I had high hopes for this.\nBut again, 'Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice' was released at a similar price tag, and has better gameplay, better acting, and better audio and visual design, that woven together gave you a grand texture of an experience you wouldn't forget anytime soon.\n\n'A Plague Tale: Innocence' however will sadly drop from my mind within the next few weeks. :-/",Not Recommended
One on the best story game of the moment !,Recommended
"If you enjoy story-focused games please don't pass this one up! It is 100% worth your time and money, especially as a high quality single player experience, from a smaller studio. The characters are all excellent, the voice acting is perfect, the setting and overall plot is compelling; it's just a great experience.\n\nThe gameplay is perhaps a bit generic, fairly standard stealth stuff for the most part, yet I still found it quite enjoyable. It has a decent mix of abilities that are unlocked over time, and solid puzzle mechanics (without getting too frustrating). Plus the Rats are very unique from other games. \n\nI'm also glad they don't overdo it with enemies and endless combat to increase total playtime, it never felt like a grind. Don't get me wrong, there are some challenging areas and I died plenty, but you're definitely playing this game for the story, characters, and world, so I'm glad they let that part shine and make levels too tedious.\n\nVisually the game is stunning, and again the voice acting is exceptional, the music is good too, it does a great job of immersing you in this world. The physics with the rats can get a little crazy, so I had some stutters here and there, but overall performance was solid, no crashes or major complaints.\n\nAgain, if you enjoy story, definitely pick this up. It's a fantastic narrative experience and I absolutely adore this game. I could easily see myself replaying it, which I rarely do. Please buy it so that they can create more, I need a sequel! :D",Recommended

We need more games like this. Single Player games are not dead we just need more games like this with a good story and plot. It's been a long time since I played a game like this and I feel like it's worth playing this game. When the game ends you just feel connected to the characters wishing nothing but good fortune to them.\n\nThe game has some fps drop issues though here and there but it's not unplayable. Totally recommend it!,Recommended
"Game is good. Some things to note if you're thinking of picking it up; pro or con, take your pick. Minor spoilers ahead:\n\n- Your dog dies very early in the game. It isn't graphic, but it does seem quite violent :(\n- Linear, with only one ending. Probably made a bit tighter of a game for it though.\n- The gameplay itself is quite shallow, but the narrative stakes make it feel rewarding. The game props itself more on it's story and atmosphere. Stealth sections, particularly while still getting used to the game, are pretty binary; succeed in staying hidden the whole time or die. This lightens up a bit later when you have the knowledge of how to disengage and hide yourself again, but it's not always possible. Thankfully, it doesn't feel very punishing to fail, and usually only sets you back a few minutes tops. Rat sections play out a bit more like puzzles. These elements are eventually married into a simple but satisfying experience from a gameplay perspective.\n- No repercussions for killing enemies, aside from some dialogue. I wondered about this, and if it would come back to bite me later, but it never does.\n- The characters are very winsome and likable, the companions were a highlight for me. I thought the voice acting overall was very middle-of-the-road, but enjoyed Amicia's VA a lot.\n- GREAT soundtrack.\n- Some 'missable' collectible items, but the game features a chapter select to go back and hunt for them if that's your thing. The game is about 10-15 hours long, depending on how completionist you are about the collectibles.\n\nThis has been my favorite game so far this year, and hope this helps if you were wondering about any of these points.",Recommended
"If you're into a linear, story-rich game that (might) jerk your tears, then this is it. I absolutely love everything from the scenery to the soundtrack, the character development and the plot. I wish the story would've been longer but I think, in a way it's good they kept it short. I bought the game with no expectations as I haven't heard about the game before buying it. To me, the game is worth every dollar I spent. It did played around with my emotions -  I was happy, sad (nearly cried), angry and fascinated throughout the game. I love each and every one of the character. [spoiler]I still can't get over Rodric's death :,([/spoiler]. I really hope Asobo makes a sequel on this game soon. \n\nTldr; I love it, great scenery and OST, great character development and plot. I can't recommend enough!",Recommended
"First of all, the story is really fascinating, the characters are interesting, and I enjoy the setting and atmosphere. However, this is the most FRUSTRATING GAME I have ever played. I wish I could throat punch the guards, irl. Sometimes you can walk right past them and they don’t notice you, and others you’re hiding behind a fricken obstacle and SOMEHOW THEY DETECT YOU. The mechanics of this game really tick me off sometimes. I’ll be running to a ledge and hit space to quickly climb it, AND THE BIMBO JUST PUSHES OF THE LEDGE AND STRAIGHT INTO THE PERSON THAT’S CHASING YOU. And there are so many different options for projectiles for Amicia to throw it honestly just gets confusing sometimes, they should have stuck to just three or four different types of ammunition. Overall, the concept of the game and the story is great, but the gameplay makes me want to smash my head on a brick wall.",Not Recommended

"Excellent game, well-developed and believable characters, gripping story (a little weird as it goes on), excellent voice acting! It is linear, but I enjoyed the immersive setting and tension. It has good music and a beautifully creepy atmosphere. \n\nThe point of this game is uncovering the story and journeying with the characters through this dark world to the conclusion. It's about helping these characters through this nightmare. It's not about collecting better gear, or completing a thousand mini quests to get the best socks! It is a story with a real sense of danger and strong and yet vulnerable characters that you can't help but fall in love with.",Recommended
"I love this game. Its voice-acting is exceptional, its unfolding secrets and complex lore are evocative and thrill with imagination, and its on-the-fly crafting and puzzles provided a consistent flow of diverse approaches to solving its one-hit kill stealth sections. One very interesting play balance within the game is the skill tree. The skill tree progresses through the collection of crafting materials, which incentivizes world exploration. On its own, this provides satisfying and sometimes profoundly rewarding upgrades, but coupled with the risk-reward of the two high-powered craftables found later in the game, you're often considering the cost of trade-offs and planning your way through to the most empowering options.\n\nBut what really elevates this game is its rat AI. Swarming hordes of maggot-writhing rats fill this game like a flood, a force of nature, and what at first appears to be simple particle physics reveals with later exploration thousands of seemingly independent actors. Walking past a hungry swarm warded off by torchlight sometimes triggers a lone rat to leap from the pack and try to take a bite out of the player. Sometimes, separated from the group, rats might rear up on their hind legs and judge the best approach for recombining with the horde. This gives the squirming horror of the game a sense of interesting character.\n\nOverall, a great piece of work that does exactly what it means to: 10/10",Recommended
"Good game overall, the parts that were good were real good and the parts that were bad were kind of hilariously bad, but [spoiler]if anyone ever comes into a design meeting wielding the phrase ""rat tornado"" shut that crap down real fast. Hoo boy.[/spoiler]",Recommended
"If you liked games like Hellblade, you'll almost certainly love this game. Just know what you're getting into: this is primarily a story driven experience, as opposed to something that is meant to provide you with some kind of interactive challenge to overcome. The back and forth between Amicia and Hugo is perfect. Their relationship is almost certainly based on the writer's personal experiences with siblings, which gives these two an authenticity not usually found in fiction. \n\nAlso, the rats terrorized not only the people of France, but my CPU as well; definitely think about upgrading your RAM or something before playing this game, particularly at max settings.",Recommended
"Extremely dull game, sadly. I usually like telltale type of games so i thought i would like this. However, despite the good story setup at the beginning of the game, it completly falls apart in gameplay sections, starts being a chore right out of the bat. Clearly not from me and dont understand the crazy hype around it even if it has a good story and graphics the rest is completly lackluster.",Not Recommended

Wonderful game.,Recommended
Puzzles are boring and predictable if you can even call them puzzles. Very on the rails and hand holding. Characters are charming and likable. Atmosphere is really neat. Wish I could still get my refund but wouldn't mind buying a more compelling version of the same game.,Not Recommended
"I bought this game after reading very positive reviews. And I have to admit, the story is exciting, along with great graphics and soundtrack which sets an excellent atmosphere for a medieval adventure. I enjoyed my time playing for certain. \nHowever, the game is very short and for this amount of money I was hoping for a longer game (20+ hour-ish). I think I beat it in about 9-10. If you're looking for a challenging game, this is not it either. I think the setting and backstory could have been explained better during the game, a lot of potential was lost here. If I could choose again, I would wait for a sale to purchase the game.",Recommended
The game is mostly enjoyable but controls are damn annoying. It becomes quite painful in advance to the game.,Recommended
"The good\nStory\nVoice acting\nSoundtrack (it is godlike)\n\nThe meh\nGameplay. This game is made largely around its narrative, so keep that in mind before buying. The stealth is super basic and late game stuff got frustrating.\n\nThe bad\nNothing\n\n\nTook me ~9 hours to complete. If you love games that revolve around story and characters, then I recommend it full price. If you don't then I'd say wait on a sale. If you're 100% gameplay and don't care about anything else, skip it.\n\nOverall I really enjoy these type of games because believe it or not good stories can be created in this medium. This one is no exception. 9/10\n",Recommended
"Amazing character-driven narrative game with stunning environment design, every chapter has its own identity, vibe and atmosphere, Amicia & Hugo are lovable and adorable, and while the game gets a bit weakened by an endgame that felt a bit forced in terms of game-design, it still overall was the most memorable game I've played this year, the quality is absolutely there.",Recommended
"What to say....\n\nPros;\n- Atmosphere, medieval France from the perspective of someone who isn't a warrior/knight or a grand strategist is a refreshing feeling. There were several instances in the story where I was taken aback by how gritty and depressing it felt. Easily the top 2 parts of the game for me.\n- Sound/music, the other best part. The soundtrack to this game is absolutely breathtaking at times. It is very well paced at the right moments, and keeps me focused and aware of every situation Im in, and brings out the right emotions at the right times. \n- Story up until the last chapter, about 3/4 of the story is excellent, with the remaining 4th being.... questionable (will get to that). It genuinely felt like I was watching a very long episode of Game of Thrones from Season 1-4 (you know, before the writing took a hit). \n\nMixed;\n- Ending, the game was down to earth and felt relatable until the last 2-3 chapters, then everything just got kind of... weird? Not realistic? Unnatural? Like it's hard to put in words without spoiling the game, I just dont find it as satisfying or fitting when compared to how excellent the first 12-13 chapters were. \n- Script/voice acting, at times its great but other times it felt forced/not fluid in the scene. I would note that I only played the game in English, and there was a french option to select if that is your thing. \n- Graphical Performance. I'll preface this by saying I have a $2000 computer, and play basically every game with no issue 1440p/144fps. This game at high settings would dip hardcore whenever you go underground, and there was a couple cutscenes that got ruined because the frames would skip a dozen times mid scene. But outside of these few hitches, it wasn't bad at all and the game (for me) stayed at a locked 120-140fps. \n\nCons;\n- Price. While I'm about supporting Developers that put a ton of passion into a good single player story, I gotta be honest and say $45 is a little steep for a single player only game with limited replayability. \n- Mechanics. They are tolerable at best, and immersion breaking at worst. I only died/got captured like ~5 times in the entire story, and 4 of them could 100% be blamed on the games choppy mechanics/unclear functions. \n\nOverall, amazing story and great story-telling experience. Subjectively, I wasn't a fan of the ending chapters compared to the first 12-13, but that aside the game is wonderful. I highly recommend this when the price drops from a sale, even if its only like a 15-20% discount.",Recommended
"shit homie that was pretty good\n\nif you like story driven games this is for you.  Some people are saying the game was kind of short but not everything has to be some long epic i was satisfied by the end of it, also its not full price.  If you enjoyed a product from start to finish even thought it can be perceived as too short is that such a bad thing?  \n\n",Recommended

"A wonderful game with a heartfelt story interwoven in the stealth style adventure game play.

"I'm about four hours in and I love this game. It's very linear with very well written characters; you really feel for the situation they're in, alone and inexperienced to take on plague-ridden France and those who want them dead. The graphics and score are beautiful and I'm looking forward to seeing how the rest of the story plays out.",Recommended

Interesting story. Wide array of well fleshed out characters. Gameplay and fighting is a bit boring and stale but doesn't ruin the experience.,Recommended
"This is a beautiful game that combines some of the realities of Middle Ages lifestyles with a bit of a fantasy take on the Black Death plague of the time. Starting off with a comfortable lifestyle and then seeing the world around you crumble away as the plague escalates was an incredible experience to go through playing this game.\n\nThe game difficulty itself would be classed as either Easy or Normal, as there are a couple of moments that require a few attempts to get things right, but that's by no means a negative. I found myself focusing/caring for characters and progressing their story far too much to ever worry about the ease of the challenges. \n\nGraphically speaking this game is also beautiful with what I found to be outstanding natural lighting effects. The voice work was top notch, and I could feel the characters happiness in the beginning and then the sudden change to fear and anger when the story really got going.\n\nOverall, definitely a game that I do not regret spending money on. For the experience side alone it was, for me at least, worth the price!",Recommended
"This game pulled me in within the first few minutes of playing.  couldn't stop myself from playing till i realized i was up till 3 am. It's very story rich and will ride your emotions if you get into games like this. \n\nI how you see the characters develop through the story, and how the world changes them. Not to mention also their own actions playing a toll on themselves too. \n\nit's great for the price it is and all I can say bad is I wish to see more from a series to this as I keep begging for more.\n\n10/10: highly recommend",Recommended

You will experience a roller coaster of emotion from sadness to happiness, fair to anger. overall this is a short and sweet story that i would highly recommend to anyone.",Recommended

Incredible graphics. The soundtrack was perfect and fits the mood. Story is interesting if somewhat predictable and really liked the stealth gameplay aspect with thousands of rats trying to eat you. \n\nHonestly this game was a big surprise me. I had no expectations and it completely wowed me with the presentation and polish. The voice acting from the leads also was surprisingly good.\n\nHighly recommend it if you're looking for a linear kind of cinematic presentation game with stealth aspects. Amicia and Hugo's tale really gripped me and had me along for the ride.,Recommended

"Incredibly rich characterization, especially Amecia and Hugo, whose performances rival any Academy award actors. A very emotional story. The simple gameplay elements are fine for me, as they do not detract you from advancing the story. Recommended. 10/10.",Recommended
"Fantastic game over all. It feels good to play, nothing janky or off about the controls imo. It plays like a methodical stealth game but the mechanics evolve and new abilities are unlocked over the course of the game so it never gets to the point where it feels like levels/mechanics are just being recycled between levels. Took me about 12 hours to finish it to a moderate level of completion for tracking down collectibles. I would say 9-10 if you ignore them all together and maybe 14 if you are a completionist. \n\nI absolutely loved this game and I'm looking forwards to any continuations that may follow this one. I would highly recommend it and say that it was worth the money put into it.",Recommended

Beautiful game with interesting story! Only con in my opinion is the game itself is a little short,Recommended
"I've just finished it and I have the same feeling as after Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice. \nPerhaps here is not the best gameplay. AI is quite stupid. Stealth mechanics ain't so immersive. \nBut on the other hand, you'll get an interesting story with great characters, heartbreaking level design, great lighting and a very dark, cruel atmosphere of medieval France in the plague period. Where cities and villages full of violence, desperate civilians and rats...Hell yeah, there will be MANY rats :) You'll hate those little bastards.  It's just magic of optimization and tehc.art tricks. \nYou must be prepared that it's a kinda fantasy story. Think about it like a Tale (like in title) and you won't be disappointed!\nI recommend a lot French localization even if you're not a fan of this language (like me). It gives a million points to atmosphere and immersive. Oh about immersive. I recommend to use immersive UI as well you will understand why.   \n\nSo yes give this game a chance and your money because it deserves them. It's not AAA game but there are no lootboxes, DLC, Seasons and other crap which game industry is sick. \nAsobo studio ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥  from ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥  I hope you'll earn a lot of money.

"I need to preface this review by saying that I thoroughly enjoyed A Plague Tale's story, characters and setting. While the gameplay and puzzles were a little shallow, it was still very fun and I enjoyed myself during the 9 hours I put into it. \nHowever, those 9 hours are the problem. I died many, [i]many[/i] times and had to repeat lengthy cart pushing sections and other such nonsense, yet I completed the game in [b]9 hours[/b] with around 70% of the collectibles. I personally cannot justify the amount of money I spent on this game for the amount of content I received. However, I recognize that not everyone thinks in the ""X hours of content is worth Y price."" If you are one of those people and you enjoy story driven games with a tight focus that does exactly what it wants to achieve with likable characters, an accurate historical setting, and above all [b][i]rat physics[/i][/b], by all means pick this game up.

"It is hard to make a recommendation one way or another on this title. But I should inform people on what exactly they are buying. Instead of going in depth, I figure it would be best to list everything for which you should temper your expectations. \n\nYou may hear many reviewers say that this game is ""long"" for a linear single player game. The story progresses quickly, and doesn't have a lot of twists and turns. Even though the game is around 13 hours, it feels significantly shorter. There isn't much of an element of discovery or mystery. You don't get the sense of agency/exploration that some other linear stories provide, such as God of War or even Bioshock. There are a few levels where exploration is the focus for a brief bit, but overall Each chapter is condensed and the environments are designed for you to be able to sneak through in a specific way. These gameplay segments are short but polished, and purposeful. \n\nYou have a limited set of skills, and each level is essentially built around allowing you a straight path through, which sometimes feels contrived and sacrifices logic for gameplay mechanics. (The same can be said about every game, but with smaller levels sometimes these things stick out more). You will find perfectly placed walls, duplicated cover assets, distractions etc. But this is well disguised in most levels and the incredible visual presentation makes up for this. Most stealth games have to place things conveniently: it is just a part of the genre. \n\n If you don't want to run around and absorb the environment, like we get to in so many other games, maybe this is a good thing for you. But given the scope of the subject matter in the story, some may be left wanting something larger and longer with more fleshed out environments, more mystery. These great big medieval set pieces are so beautiful that some players may want to spend much longer absorbing them like we do in RPGS or Tomb Raider. Even for an intentionally linear experience that avoids the pitfalls of dull open world games, this game at times felt incomplete. Each critical story revelation comes and goes very quickly, and I personally wanted more time to become invested in these payoffs. I absolutely respect what these developers did. But I would take all these things into account before buying this game at full price.",Recommended

NOPE. Looks decent but an absolute loser. This is not a game. The first 2 hours is the slowest 'tutorial' I have ever come across.  SOOOOOO BORING. I wish I could get those couple hours back.

"wonderfull game, 1 huge problem, you have no idea how rats work. no light is gonna stop them especially in large numbers when they're hungry and baited. your whole game acts like light keeps you safe but if you get turned into human bait for rats which you made possible, no torch or flashlight is gonna save you, which makes this game entirely less immersive and complete crap. and using the same materials for your weapon enhancements and your gear, how lazy are you? i have 3 rats so i know exactly  what they're like, and they're tame, and even then no light is gonna stop em when i have a snack, no fire, no flashlight, nothin but killing them is gonna stop em, and even your firebombs dont kill em, so they're not even rats. ive also seen plenty disintegrate under light, wtf? and ffs how hard is it to grab ANYTHING sharp which is quite literally EVERYWHERE and use it to kill someone with? a helmet aint gonna save you from a spear to the back of your head, which are laying around everywhere, just like swords, even if you cant keep em it doesnt mean they're suddenly invisible to usage when they're pretty much plenty usefull in almost every scenario. for 45 bucks, i expected more of this. another big letdown. just like that eternal crap of mobs always knowing Exactly where you are if you attack them, even if its from behind and just their lantern leaving them No way to trajectory track, they still come Right to you. when are game devs actually gonna fix that impossible tracking bullshit?",Not Recommended
"TL;DR - Stealth Game, with SOME battle stuff, Interesting Story, 10 hours of game play max, excluding replay value. And I STILL RECOMMEND IT.\n\nLonger Version: You play as a girl, named Amicia de Rune, left with charge of her young brother - Hugo -, who might be five? Maybe? The entire thing is a chronicle of her trying to save him, and you're left in the dark for a large portion of the story, unless you're a good listener. The story is told by dialog caught from NPCs, and believe it or not, your choices have some affect on your game. \n\nIt is NOT A HARD GAME. It's like baby souls, with quick saves, rather frequently, and most of the time you can decide to spare enemies, instead of killing them. Again, your choices do have some affect. They did an AMAZING JOB at building the characters, and the world, and I'm sad that they didn't get more money or time, because I just wanted to know more. It's a fantasy game, with fantasy characters, based in some fact. \n\nOkay, I love it. If you're not sold, wait until a steam sale, but I don't think you'll regret it if you like puzzles, stealth, and world-story telling.",Recommended

"Oh, how I've been waiting for this game! A real master piece!\n\nFirst things first: if you're searching for a challenging stealth game, then A Plague Tale will disappoint you. The game mechanics are neatly done and working well together but not challenging. The levels are linear and there's often just one way to solve the (simple) riddles or to sneak around guards. \n\nBut from the narrative perspective this game is a real master piece: the threatening atmosphere, the credible written characters, the thrilling story and the excellent music ... amazing!\n\nSo if you like story driven games with a deep atmosphere, like Hellblade, you should play this game!",Recommended
"A Plague Tale: Innocence is:\n+/- A heavy story focused game.\n+/- Some can say the game is a bit too short for the price with little to no replayability (except for those that want 100% achievement).\n+ Visually stunning (truly the graphics is just outstanding, expect nothing less from a 2019 game).\n+ Audio/music is phenomenal (really give that medieval vibe).\n+ Voice actings are amazing (they actually speak english with a french accent).\n+ Lovable characters.\n+ Great characters' developments (even with side/supporting characters).\n+ Engaging story and it's quite a dark one (at least for me).\n+ Never have i seen that many rats on screen in a video game (and probably will never see another one like this game).\n+ Great optimization, almost bug/glitch free (i only encouterd a glitch where i tried to pick things up near the ""invisible wall"" but it fixed itself, i didn't have to restart from check point).\n- Combat definitely not the strong point of this game, it gets rather repetitive after few chapters which probably might make you want to give up on this game.\n- Solving puzzle is rather simple and some feel more like trial&error instead.\n=> Verdict: yes it is a linear single-player game, yes the gameplays/combats might be boring/repetitive for some people, yes it might be a bit expensive for what it offers but still i highly recommend everyone to try out this beautiful under-rated gem. 9.5/10",Recommended
Great Story! I really loved playing this game and would highly recommend it to those who need to overcome their fear of rats...,Recommended
Good stuff.  Really enjoyable.,Recommended
"[b]Awesome Game[/b]\nHeavy Story focus and linear stealth playstyle with more mechanics than I would've expected.\nAlso an awesome English synchronisation.\nAnd don't fear it being a ""escort mission game"", it's definitely not of one of those pesky missions like in other games",Recommended
"A very good game. The setting is masterfully pulled off and sucks you right in. From the oppressive horde of rats to the desperate clinging for even a spark of light. The Soundtrack is fantastic. The story does what its supposed to, no real pomp or frills, and the characters are great. (Namely the two leads, some of the side characters are a bit one-dimensional or over the top, save lucas)",Recommended
"3 Hours into this game and I can say for sure you should DEFINITELY get this game! I bought this after release and still got the DLC content with my purchases which is consumer oriented, a massive positive! A lot of games today usually never get me hooked after 8 hrs but rare games like this and God of War had me immersed and hooked right off the bat with great story-telling and character development. I'm already invested with the 2 main characters and I want to explore the world. To have someone like me who rarely enjoy today's games with their crappy micro-transactions, loot-boxes, always online etc says a lot about the studio/devs but hey, that's just my opinion. Try the game out yourself and be your own judge.  Worth the asking price and I would buy the DLC content again just to show my support for games done right.",Recommended
What a phenomenal game! Beautiful soundtrack mixed with wonderful story telling. This is a game that shows the purest form of story telling in games.\n\nThis game feels like a breath of fresh air. With a unique and original story. With a compelling cast with amazing voice acting.\n\nIf you're looking for a game to completely immerse yourself in and get emotionally attached to characters this is the perfect game. \n\nThis is a sleeper game of 2019. If a sequel is ever to be released I'll be waiting for it eagerly\n\n10/10,Recommended
"Pretty good. I liked it. Story was nice and easy to get sucked into where the hours fly past. Combat and stealth mechanics are what you pretty expect from most stealth focused games. If you want something to pass the time, and want to enjoy a good story then I'd recommend you pick it up.",Recommended
fucking awsome,Recommended
Could pet the dog,Recommended
"Wow!  What a surprisingly phenomenal game!  I was blown away.  The story is very very good (as everyone says), but I found myself enjoy the gameplay as well.  It was a fresh take on Stealth gameplay; looking at it more as a puzzle than a success/fail type of thing.  I kept changing and evolving which made it more and more enjoyable as time went on.",Recommended
"I just want to say a big thank you for a game so well made and a story worth listening to. I never really enjoyed listening to stories in games as they are just bland and your typical story but this one truly stood out like the rest and caught my eye. Now I never really do any reviews or have ever done any reviews in video games, but this one will be my first. This game hooked my heart the first 30 minutes into the play time. Although I get through games fairly quick, roughly in 2-3 days normally, this one was worth the time spent. I very much enjoyed the characters and the plot twists and to be fair, I never tear up in video games but this one made me... thank you for the effort in this wonderful game. I hope to see more with this and definitely plan on purchasing any expansion DLC to the story and game. I wish to see another sequel developed alongside with this.",Recommended
"A strong effort that's easy to recommend for fans of darker narrative-focused games. It's flawed in some ways: some of the simpler gameplay elements disrupt the immersive world built upon the impressive art direction and excellently acted and written storytelling. There's also a few trope-y moments with the villain that seem out of place with the otherwise great writing. That aside, the characters and their interactions are wonderful and the English voice acting was truly outstanding. And that music! Easily one of the best video games scores of in recent years.\n\nGreat job Asobo. Can't wait for your next game!",Recommended
"This game is great. The story is great, the atmospheric sound and music are great. The only part that isn't too great is the combat. That being said, it differs so much from what we're used to that it makes it feel just a little better, to the point where you'll get used to it. A Plague Tale: Innocence does a lot very well, as long as you can bring yourself to pay for it. At 8-10 hours of game play for $45 it can look a bit steep initially, but it is well worth it if what you're looking for is a beautiful, immersive experience that is far different than other games out there. As of late, it's hard to find a good unique story rich game, but I can say for sure this is one of them.",Recommended
Amazing Story,Recommended
"I first learned of this game from Jim Sterling on his youtube channel. I decided to try it out and lo and behold I wasn't disappointed.  The game is amazingly well done and has a certain flair to it that stands out from most stealth games. Despite Eurogamer's review I personally find its stealth mechanics quite pleasing. Early on you have to rely more on stealth to the point it gets a little lame. as you progress though, you can actually choose to do stealth or take out enemies in a variety of nasty ways. Be it simply hitting them on the head with a rock from your sling or destroying their lanterns to feed them to rats any time you manage to get a kill like this, it's certainly enjoyable. Granted, you also don't have to kill enemies. Sometimes it's actually preferable to sneak past them instead. Especially when they are a particularly tough enemy you can't take out normally.\n\nNow onto the rats. the rats are an ever pending menace in the game. Anywhere it's dark, expect to see rats. The rats are quite voracious and will eat anyone or anything foolish enough to walk into their swarms. The rats are held at bay by light which the player must use consistently in the game. In later portions of the game, players will also have to defend light sources from rats that come together in clusters to put out the light sources. Close to the very end of the game, the character Hugo will gain the power to control the rats, allowing the player to use them as an attack against enemies. \n\nAs for the story itself, it's very well written and if you play games for their story you definitely won't be left out. I found myself on the edge of my seat at times trying to get past tough sections of the game just to see what happened next. I'd love to go into details but I don't want to spoil it for newcomers.",Recommended
"Just finished the game in 12 hours (like to take my time and explore and soak in the atmosphere), after quite some time again a game that kept my interest right from the start until the end.\n\nIts a great story focused game with really nice graphics, sound/music and really beautiful atmosphere (meaning dark, grim and brutal). I was a bit afraid that the main protagonists are kids, but they are well written and believable and the story is great (I thought of another ending that would suit it more but thats just my idea).\n\nThe gameplay fits the genre perfectly - its not overly complicated to slow the flow of the story, but also not too simplified and easy that it would get boring. New mechanics are being introduced almost until the end of the game, so you still get new stuff/skills to use that keeps it fresh. The gameplay in general consists of 3 parts - exploration, stealth (around knights), simple ""puzzles"" (around rats)\n\nFor me the biggest impression was the atmosphere - mainly as I already mentioned the way it managed to bring me close to the brutality and despair of war torn country decimated also by plague. What monstrosities it produces, how terrible it affects people ... including me. Its one of the few games where I was doing emotive decisions that I later thought about in real world (another game that I loved for this was Spec Ops). With one very special moment that sent shivers down my spine in a manner that didnt happen for a long time\n\nSomebody might find it too short, but for me it was the perfect length (and considering price - its about 4E per hour so the same as cinema would cost me :-))\n\nAnd last thing I was happy about - NO stupid quick time events (thats a plague for games in my eyes :D )",Recommended
"This is a good, solid game but falls just short of being great. First, I'll start with what I loved about the game. The environment is incredible. The graphics, art design, sound, and detail are executed to near perfection. The world is incredibly immersive. The story is pretty good and the characters are well done with amazing voice acting. The music is incredible but sometimes got overbearing at some moments. The gameplay fits well with how the world is designed and  never really felt like a chore to me (Stealth based games can get annoying). You get new tools to use every few chapters so the gameplay evolves as you play although I found close to the end only using a couple different methods. The game is very easy which can be good for those looking to just experience the story but not ideal for those who like to be challenged. The chapters take you to different settings with different designs and atmospheres so you never get bored with the scenery. Game is very well paced and some-what quick chapters make it something you can experience in small snippets but it's still not a long game. The crafting system is very simple but effective and allows you to get some nice upgrades for your weapon and tools. The materials are found all over the world so it gives you another excuse to explore. There are side characters that join you on your journey and you even spend some chapters with them at your side and each has their own ability to use in stealth which further refreshes the gameplay experience. \n\nOn to the things I didn't like. The story starts off so strong and really pulled me into this gritty world on the brink of an apocalypse. It creates a mystery around the the little brother and it was interesting seeing the plot unfold. Unfortunately it dipped in the third act. There's nothing objectively wrong with it but it didn't have the same pull or lure as the first half of the game. The final boss was also pretty weak and didn't fit with the rest of the game. The characters have incredible voice talent (even the little boy) but I never felt truly connected with any of the characters to care what happens. They didn't have small dialogue moments or cutscenes that really showed them becoming closer. I felt that the only reason these two characters are becoming closer is the fact that they're siblings and the sister only cares about the child because she has to as the older sister. I still enjoyed the characters but wished there was more to their time together like what we've seen in other games such as Last of Us, God of War, etc. Even the side characters only had dialogue to further the plot instead of the other characters and the player learning more about them. The brother, also, didn't feel like he developed through the story like kids in other games. He would run off when he doesn't understand the actions of his sister (The player) which makes sense given his age but given the world these characters are thrown into, I expected him to show some sort of development as he must learn to survive. The game is short at about 9 hours and that's me taking my time and exploring. Some of the crafting upgrades were frustrating because I found myself lacking in material for all the third tier upgrades even though I scavenged a lot. It seems it is impossible to unlock all the upgrades given the shortage of materials and time but I could be wrong.\n\nOverall the game is very good. If you like narrative driven games that are immersive with simple yet fun gameplay, this is the game for you. However, if you're expecting another game like The Last of Us, which several people are comparing it to, then maybe not. It hits on the same beats but it's not as emotionally gripping, for me, as others are saying. Given it's developed by a smaller studio, I was happy to support them. They all have incredible talent and should be proud of the game and I'm glad it's doing well. I would suggest the game to be closer to $30 given its length but I didn't mind spending the full price. I really enjoyed it and wanted to like it more but couldn't. I do recommend this game to most people but is a bit pricey if you don't care to appreciate the world. The setting and plot were a nice change for most of the games out today and look forward to a possible sequel or other IP's these devs put out.\n\nPros:\n+Graphics\n+Art design\n+World design\n+Detail\n+Sound design\n+Music\n+Original plot\n+Voice acting\n+Gameplay\n\nCons:\n-Weak third act\n-Characters could be more developed\n-Materials can be scarce at times\n-Short \n-Almost no replay value\n\nI love narrative games with amazing characters and this falls just short. Definitely things that can be flushed out in DLC or a sequel.  Nonetheless, good game and would recommend.",Recommended
"[i][url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/35145066/] Feel free to follow my review page![/url][/i]\n\n[h1]The gist of it:[/h1]\nA Plague Tale: Innocence is pretty much a decent linear story focused game, with an emphasis on a rat plague and what that entails for our characters in the game, with nothing truly standing out that would make the game special. \n\n👍 [u]The good parts:[/u]\n-A chilling atmosphere and some really good looking vistas.\n-The rats mechanic is interesting. \n-Interesting story with a huge potential to be something a lot more than what was presented in the game. \n\n👎[u]The bad parts:[/u]\n -Voice acting is not that emotional or engaging, it's just average.\n-Textures look kinda ugly up close. \n-Extremely average gameplay that never truly shines or expands on the mechanics presented, neither through puzzles nor in the stealth parts. \n-Forced auto-aiming that sometimes just stops working. \n\n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\nThe story starts with the beginning of a rat plague and invasion,  as well as some higher religious conspiracy involving our protagonists family. You'll be playing with Amicia, a very emotional young lady that sadly goes through some tough moments throughout the game, while at the same time having to worry about her little brother. \n\nThere are some cool story moments that will make you wonder what's going on and how it all truly started but sadly it just leaves a lot of things up in the air, perhaps for a sequel or worse, they ran out of budget. There's clearly some lore behind what's happening with the rats but it just never goes too deep into it leaving the story feeling okay at best.\n\nSome people may get more emotionally involved with the characters however their voice acting, which I'll detail later, did not click with me as much and most twists were very obvious. Though I have to give them credit, it's a decent start if it ever continues.\n\nStory rating: 7.5/10\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nThe gameplay pretty much consists of some stealth-puzzle thingmajig where you just go through linear paths and avoid the rats or human guards blocking your way.\n\n The way you deal with the human enemies is through some interesting stealth mechanics where you either have to distract and move past them or engage in combat where you have to use your sling upgrades. Most combat scenarios are extremely boring and repetitive where the enemies just come at you as simple as possible and you just auto-aim at their heads. Later in the game, you will use the rats against them which is cool but short-lived just like any sling mechanic introduced. \n\nThe rats, on the other hand, are a cool mechanic where you have to manipulate them through some light puzzles, which the rats are scared of. I enjoyed these so-called environmental puzzles but just like everything else in the game, it never goes too deep or evolves. It's easy from the start and until the end. \n\nGameplay rating:  7.5/10\n\n[h1]Audio[/h1]\nSoundtrack and sound effects are all pretty decent and help a lot in making the atmosphere feel desperate and unforgiving which is important for a story focused game.\n\nThe voice acting, on the other hand, I personally found it very average for some reason. I really did not like any of the characters voices even though it seems like they're trying to make us feel emotional. It's a matter of preference perhaps but the actors needed a better directing or choreography. If they ever fix that issue in the sequels, assuming there will be one, then surely the story will have a much bigger impact.\n\nAudio rating:  7.5/10\n\n[h1]Graphics, performance and tech analysis[/h1]\nThe game has some really great lighting and quite a nice looking atmosphere from lush forests to abandoned villages. They all look and feel perfect with what the story tries to portray us. Sadly the textures needed a lot more work since, at close up, everything looks muddy with very low resolution. Character facials could also use more improvement. \n\nThe game runs pretty much perfect on my high-end rig however there were quite a number of bugs encountered in the game, from being unable to move to forced auto-aim completely failing, resulting in a lot of repetitive and pointless reloads. \n\nGraphics, performance and tech analysis score: 7.5/10\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nIt's interesting how every aspect of the game falls down to being just okay, and honestly, I couldn't give it more than 7.5 nor less despite what at the surface seems like quite the emotional story experience. A Plague Tale: Innocence never takes too many risks but instead gives us what I would call a safe experience where you can't really dislike it but cannot praise it either. I would probably wait for a sale on this one and as always read the negative reviews, not just the overly positives ones. \n\n[h1]Final score: 7.5/10[/h1]",Recommended
A great game for anyone who likes single-player story based games without too challenging gameplay. The characters are well thought out and come to life. The graphics are simply beautiful and the music adds to the great atmosphere. The crafting system is a little out of place my opinion because it doesn't really add to the game and made me run around and collect items which was a little distracting. All in all a must have for anyone remotely interested in medieval based games.,Recommended
"Epic Rat Battles of Historrryyyyyyy\n\nIf you enjoy truly memorable singleplayer stories with unique settings, characters, and mechanics, you'll love this game. It's gorgeous, the voicework is excellent, and the sound design matches. It's a linear story that reminds me of games like Hellblade and  The Last of Us.",Recommended
"This is a masterpiece. Asobo used their own engine for this one, creating beautiful, detailed and historically accurate levels.\n\nIt's a very immersive game with an incredibly strong (though linear) storyline. Prepare to be moved. Controls aren't too complex, but you'll be needing your reflexes from time to time.\n\nBit of advice; use french audio and english subs, it adds to the immersion (and the english voices have a funny accent).",Recommended
Great game with a great story,Recommended
"I was just looking through games out, saw this game was rated well and the trailer looked pretty cool. Wont lie, it was a bit of a leap for $45, but after playing the first hour, I was completely hooked. This game is a fantastic single player story focused game. The style, the gameplay, the story, all fantastic. While at work i'd be eager to get home and play more, and I easily consider this the best game out right now. The worst part is that it's over :(\n\nTLDR:\n-Fantastic story\n-Amazing soundtrack\n-Incredible immersion\n-Optimized and bug-free for my experience\n-Great voice acting\n-Almost seemless transition between cutscenes and gameplay (the graphics are great and almost identical between them, no jarring cut between a cutscene and gameplay)\n-~9-10 hours of gameplay if you explore and take your time rather than rush, great for a new game at its price",Recommended
"At the time of writing this review, it is a mere 5 minutes ago that I completed the game. I absolutely LOVED it. The story is simply amazing, and the graphics are an absolute dream! The characters are vibrant, and the game mechanics (although simple and few) are really interesting and offers a lot when it comes to strategizing the next move of stealth/combat.\n\nNormally I am not really that much into stealth-games, but APPARENTLY when it is done right, I can end up loving the gameplay. Who knew!? There are probably many people that spoils too much of the story in some of these steam reviews (there always are.) so I will spare you. All I will say is... PLAY THE GAME! If you like story-rich games, you'll probably love this one.",Recommended
"This game is a wonderful story experience. This game draws a lot of similarities to ""The Last of us"" except much shorter and lacking a great bit on gameplay. The story is decent and keeps you hooked throughout. The graphics are really well done, and compliment the game nicely. Game play is stealth based, but getting caught is rather hard if you aren't a stranger to this which makes it hardly a challenge for people like me. Also the puzzles are hardly a challenge. I get more challenge from 20 piece jig-saw puzzles. From what I've read from the developers so far is they have seen this as a one and done game which makes me sad. I would love to see a sequel to this game, [spoiler] even if it's not in the same time period, and tell us more about the de rune bloodline and why the inquisition existed and how they knew what they knew. [/spoiler] A great game if you are looking for a good story driven game. If you are short on money, i'd wait until it goes on sale. Otherwise the game is worth the full price.",Recommended
"Pretty good. Pretty interesting story, but seems somewhat generic. Path to hero, loses friends, wins at the end of the day. \nG R E A T F K E N N A R R A T O R\nCombat system decent. Has great atmosphere immersion, with good bgm. \nYou're mainly paying for the story, if you're going to get this game. \nOverall pretty damn good.",Recommended
"A good game, though quite short and linear for it's price. It takes ~10 hours to complete at a healthy pace, and is, for me at least, almost entirely carried by voice acting, which is among the best VO performances I have ever heard. The plot is fairly standard and predictable, and that's OK. Characters and dialogue are well-written, even if Hugo's dialogue sounds somewhat strange towards the end.\n\nGameplay is well-designed stealth, but controls are clunky and annoying. Protagonist's weapon also doesn't make any sense. She is positioned as a huntress, and until the end I expected to get a bow as an upgrade, but no. The weapon she uses is very annoying and visual ques the game gives about when to let go of the mouse and how to time shots are not accurate either. \n\nAI is dumb as bricks and levels are linear and small. Linearity gets ridiculous sometimes where the game can make it impossible to progress because you've done something outside of the scripted order. I had to use cheats to get past certain points in the game since I didn't play the way it expected me to before and had no ammo to complete the next section and you can't go back to previous checkpoints.\n\nEnding is somewhat of a sequel bait, although I don't necessarily dislike that as long as they actually make a sequel. Overall if you can afford 10 hours of enjoyable characters and varied, albeit clunky, stealth gameplay for 45€ - go for it. For the rest I'd recommend it at 30€ or something like that. Really happy to see a studio's first ambitious game turning out to be such a success.",Recommended
"Anyone even vaguely familiar with my taste in games won't be surprised I'm giving this a thumb-up. But why [i]that[/i] high a Verdict? Well, brave adventurer, thereby hangs a tale...and a highly entertaining and engaging one at that!\n\n   Our story begins with teenaged Amicia, a privileged French girl whose family and servants are murdered before her eyes. All of her family, that is, bar her sickly younger brother Hugo, who she must now endeavour to keep alive at all costs. Amicia and Hugo must survive by sneaking, running, crafting, puzzling and, upon occasion, [i]fighting[/i] their way to safety, in a land fraught with constant dangers ranging from Inquisition soldiers to paranoid villagers to swarms of plague-ridden rats.\n\n   From the very start it's clear that storytelling is this game's main priority, and telling a story is something that it does very well. For some the game may seem a tad ""linear""; but most should appreciate how seamlessly plot revelations and vital tutorials alike are unveiled, with minimal recourse to non-interactive cutscenes or screens full of text. The way an otherwise action-oriented story probably [i]should[/i] be told, in other words, with narrative and gameplay virtually indivisible at all times.\n\n   I'm honestly not going to say much more than this, as you probably have an idea how keen you are for this game by now; and to say much more is to simply offer up spoilers. Did you love The Last of Us, the Outlast Games, the Dishonored games, or the recent Tomb Raider games? If you answered yes to any of these, your odds of enjoying this are pretty high. Heck: I don't buy a lot of games on release day any more, and didn't regret forking over full price for this one in the slightest. Easily one of my Top Two games of the year thus far (alongside the Resident Evil 2 remake).\n\n   My only notable criticism? The difficulty spike towards the end is a tad steep, and the final boss battle much, much harder than anything that precedes it. But it's still a highly accessible game for almost anyone, bar the most ""casual"" or most ""hardcore"" of gamers (for whom it may prove too challenging or too easy, respectively).\n\n   Verdict: 9.5/10.\n\n(PS If you enjoyed this review, feel free to check out my two Curator pages: http://store.steampowered.com/curator/9284586-ReviewsJustfortheHELLofit/​\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/curator/10868048-Truly-Horrible-Horror-Games/?appid=398210​\nCheers!)",Recommended

"[h1] Video Review[/h1]\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkDBYFyRNPQ\n\n[h1] Written Review [/h1]\nA Plague tale is a story-driven game where you play as Amicia, a young woman trying to survive through the plague with her little brother, Hugo. \nIt's primarily a stealth game, as you are mostly defenceless against the savage rat hordes and Inquisition knights. \n\nThe game has simple puzzles scattered throughout, that give you the opportunity to lure enemies away from you. You are equipped with a sling that you can use to hurl stones into objects, like chains holding meat up, which will lure away the ever-hungry rat waves, or metallic objects to distract guards. \nYou can also use it to kill knights without helmets, but you need to be careful as the sling makes a lot of noise. That's why you can alternatively THROW rocks instead. It'll be silent, but you have a shorter range. You have a few more tools at your disposal too. You can craft projectiles that ignite flammable objects in order to scare rats away, or make expensive sedative powders that you shove into knights' faces to incapacitate them.\n\nYou will need to be a bit careful with your resources though, as you do also want to save enough materials for crafting permanent upgrades. If you explore slightly off the beaten path, you will be able to find common and rare materials that you can use to upgrade your carrying capacity, sling shot speed, etc. \nThere are also collectibles scattered throughout the game that prompt the two main characters to make comments that add to the lore or build up their relationship.\n\nThe game's main attraction is the well-developed story and atmosphere. It's a grim world, and you always feel like you're in danger. The two main characters are voice acted very well. They feel like believable characters, and there are small details that make them feel really alive. For example, although Hugo is the more vulnerable one, he does occasionally help you out. And there are times where he'll run ahead and comment on something. It makes him feel like a real child, exploring the world. \n\nThe game looks great. Bright areas look beautifully lit by the sun, while dark areas are foreboding and eerie. The sound design helps immerse you, and the music builds up tension very well.\n\nOverall, I am really loving the game and highly recommend it if you enjoy linear narratives, dark themes or stealthy games that are light on combat. \nA great experience overall!",Recommended
Fantastic experience. If you love story driven games then what are u waiting for ?,Recommended
very good,Recommended
"9/10 \nOne of the best games I've played this year. A truly compelling and moving story. The gameplay is a crossbreed between Thief and Hellblade, but with it's own unique twist. It just works. While the animations aren't great, the textures are stunning. Definitely a buy!",Recommended
Is good ya,Recommended
"I absolutely love this game! \nIf you are a fan of playing a role in a narrative, then you must like this. \nThe gameplay is a great experience and graphics are amazing.\nIt's Recommended that the puzzles and missions aren't too difficult, but that is exactly what I like. \nIf you listen to what the characters say, it's mostly quite obvious what you have to do, so it's not very challenging. But to me (personally) that's a good thing, I like to relax while gaming and not get frustrated because I'm stuck. \nThis gameplay feels like being an actor in a film, or with some empathy it feels like living in the 14th century for some time!\nPlease more of this!!!",Recommended
I bought this game just for the story and the world present in the game. I didn't regret at all. The gameplay is fun on its own way too.,Recommended
"[i]Reading all the comments/reviews about the game kind of raised the expectations for me. \nI understand this is part of the gaming experience in the modern days. On the other hand though, this is the reason why reviews will reflect that as well.[/i]\n\n[h1]The Story (no spoilers)[/h1]\n\nThe story is good but not great! \nFor me, it would take a bit more to convince me and get me emotionally connected. If this was an attempt to emotionally connect gamer with the character, i believe it's a poor one.\nThe story could have been so much better if they added probably an additional hour of gameplay to help people connect with the story. Other than that it was a pretty steady experience. It's Like watching a movie you are not crazy about with a friend, for the sake of watching something.\nAlso another major disappointment is that there's not a proper ending for some of the characters! i don't want to mention names here and spoil it for anyone but if you play or played the game you will see.\n\n[h1]The GamePlay[/h1]\n\nIt is a Linear game, which makes it easier to complete without losing interest. Throughout your journey, there are some hidden artifacts and items. Sometimes, acquiring them even means you need to totally go against of the story. For example you have a bunch of guys running after you to kill you and you don't even have 1 second to stop but you will somehow find 3-4 minutes (or even 2hours if you wish) to explore that turn left to find a flower....and the bad guys will not make their move until you go through the door you're supposed to go in the first place. I guess that reminds you that it's just a game but on the other hand it's the same thing that disconnects you from the story...again this is only my opinion.\nCharacter movement and fighting is functional. Sometimes the story and dialogues slow down your character but not beyond the boundaries of acceptable. \n\n[h1]Graphics & Sound[/h1]\n\nSound is great, it won't take much of the game to realize that. And the graphics are excellent, the characters are well designed. \n\n\n[h1]VoiceOvers and Acting[/h1]\n\nThe characters and acting in general may have done well but only up to the point the script allowed them to. Meaning it feels like they somehow capped it? I don't know if this expression is clear but i somehow feel that the game writers/developers and directors limited the acting. You can see that the actors did from OK to Good but as the game story unfolds and certain intense events happen, you expect some reactions that are considered humane that never happen. This is not only the actors fault but probably the directors. But the bottom line is that it really hurts the game rating.\n\n[h1]Music[/h1]\n\nThe music is absolutely great! In the credits i only noticed one person responsible for the music and i felt like ""WOW, this man really saves alot for this game with just his music"". It's really incredible how much better game this is because of the sound and music.\n\n[h1]Bugs[/h1]\n\nThere were some bugs and two times on my game there was a major one that saved right before i died and i had to play the chapter from the beginning (the game doesn't realize it saves right before you die and you have to figure out what to do to keep playing)\nOther than that their were some minor other bugs but nothing that makes the game unplayable.\n\n[b]OVERALL[/b]\n\nI regretfully say that this game is overrated for mainly two reasons. \nFirst because people will play it after they see all these reviews and expect more than they will get. Some of them may even feel that they played a great game while in fact they played a mediocre or an above average one. It's a good experiment for me to see how people experience this whole thing.\n\nSecondly, I feel that for this game to be developed, a lot of work and effort was put BUT so does building the TITANIC....I feel we are paying for the effort but not the overall value of the game as a Gaming Experience. It's not an awful game, don't get me wrong, but it's not a 8/10 or 10/10 they advertise on the game cover either. DEFINITELY NOT\n\n...I 've been writing this review without knowing weather to give it a positive or a negative review from the start. I guess i wanted to get my experience out on the screen, then read everything i wrote before deciding. And after reading again what i 've wrote, unfortunately it's going to be a negative review....\nThe truth is that this game doesn't deserve it but it neither deserves the 45EUROS people pay for it. For what is worth, I believe this game should be priced 22-26EUROS, but don't take my word for it. Play the game for 45EUROS and write your review to let others know your experience!",Not Recommended
"[h1] A Plague Tale - Innocence is a dark and emotional story about Amicia and her younger brother Hugo. Together they have to survive during one of the most memorable and darkest parts of world history. [/h1] \n\n[b] Pros: [/b]\n\n+ Story based emotional game with a grim atmosphere strongly focused on the brother and sister relationships topic.\n+ Remarkable and perfectly designed characters\n+ Satisfying stealth mechanics of the game\n+ A wide arsenal of weapons and instruments to help the player survive in this madness\n+ Pretty interesting though not challenging puzzles to solve\n+ Rats are not disgusting or repulsive at all as I thought they would be in a game like this one\n+ Memorable surroundings that force you to smash your F12 button every now and then\n+ Outstanding graphics\n+ Voice acting is something you will remember for a long time\n\n[b] Cons: [/b]\n\n- Very linear progression where the player can’t even get lost or explore enough \n- Sometimes enemies feel painfully stupid doing nonsense actions\n- Players’ choices don’t matter at all and never affect the story \n- Doesn’t provide much of a challenge\n\nWhat an excellent journey I just had! Seriously, I am speechless, A Plague Tale - Innocence is that kind of game that will easily get into my Top games of 2019 list. I was always fond of games that have this spirit of AAA games without having enormous budgets or support from big-shot investors. Games like this are the perfect example that if you are dedicated to something and work hard for it, you will be blessed and people are going to see your efforts.\n\nA Plague Tale - Innocence is a perfect mix of great storytelling, exciting stealth gameplay and an atmospheric grotesque vibes all over the game that set the right mood. Of course, the game is not without the flaws, but they are some minor compared to its bright sides, that they are not even worth mentioning and paying too much attention to them. \n\n[h1] Story [/h1]\n\nThe game is set in 14th century France and tells a story about brave young girl Amicia De Rune who has to take care of her younger brother Hugo who was sick since the day he was born. Both of them are members of the noble family and one day after their family has been slaughtered by the Inquisition they have to run away and fight for their lives. On top of that, they have to be careful and stay away from the army of black rats, who tend to kill every single human being. One interesting detail: the game never uses the word “plague” apart from the name of the game, of course, to describe that whole madness with rats. \n\n[h1] Gameplay [/h1]\n\nThe game starts pretty slow and measuredly, showing us two innocent children trying to escape the enemies in a stealth way and these first scenes set the mood for the game, explaining to us that the player has to be careful and stay invisible all the time. At one moment, Amicia finds herself in the situation where she has to protect her brother and use the weapon she used to employ only during the animal huntings with her father to kill a soldier.\n\nFrom this moment the whole game starts to gain momentum and the player gets a chance to learn about Amicia arsenal and gadgets she can use to get rid of soldiers or army of rats. The more you progress with the story the more gadgets will unlock for you and it’s funny to see how the game throws up all these new things at the most convenient moment. Imagine, that you are in the situation, where the whole area is illuminated and the player has to get rid of this light to sneak behind he soldiers or kill them silently in the dark. And then, all of a sudden, you hear from one of the survivors who joined your group that he has a good thing that can be useful here and they were looking for a good moment to finally introduce it to you. \n\nIn general, A Plague Tale - Innocence is a very linear game filled with puzzles to solve. All these puzzles are pretty easy and never require you to think a lot, so you won’t be distracted from the main story at all. Usually, these puzzles require you to push the box, or pull some kind of a lever, or lit the fire, because rats are afraid of it. It was a bit sad to realize that the game is pretty linear and doesn’t let you explore a big open plague-stricken world. You basically just jump from one chapter to another, progressing with the story and enjoying the grim atmosphere with no big challenge at all.\n\nLuckily, DeRune family are not the only survivors in this dark place and from time to time they get accompanied by random strangers, who help them during their journey. Teamwork is a key and the player can always send someone to either bash the door, pick the lock or crouch through the tiny hole to open the door from the other side. At some scenes, Amicia has to protect her teammates from the soldiers or rats while they are doing something important. Dealing with rats is probably the most important part of the game because Amicia can either do everything to drive them away or even use them in their needs. The key weapon there will be fire, with the ultimate use of lighting and extinguishing them whenever it needed.\n\nThe game has a pretty simple crafting system that lets Amicia upgrade her arsenal and create special powders. The variety of these tools are pretty amazing - small bombs, sleeping dust, special dust that helps the player to get rid of soldier’s helmets from their heads, the powder that attracts rats, etc. But the main weapon for the whole game will remain Amicia’s slingshot that she uses all the time with stones. I can’t even describe that satisfying feeling when the game auto-aim to the soldier’s bare head and instantly kill them after firing, simply brilliant!\n\nStealth is something that will remain an important part of the game mechanics until the very end of the game. Keeping in mind that the whole game is pretty linear, the player has to remember that there are not so many options on how to eliminate the enemy or how to outsmart them and sneak behind. So that whole stealth thing is not something that game forces you to use, it’s just the most logical way how survivors should act during these circumstances.\n\nAnd, of course, A Plague Tale - Innocence doesn’t forget about the fact that Hugo is a small kid that acts the way he has to with the most childish behavior. If Amicia leaves Hugo alone and walks far away, he starts to panic and screaming attracting the attention of nearby families. Sometimes Amicia and Hugo have small conflicts during their journey that grow into something bigger and more serious by the end of the game, but this is something that you have experience by yourself.         \n\n[h1] Graphics [/h1]\n\nFor a small budget like this one, A Plague Tale - Innocence has very impressive graphics with some very atmospheric scenes and landscapes, making the player want to hit that F12 button all the time, capturing all this beauty and saving them all into their screenshots section.\n\n[h1] Sound [/h1]\n\nMusic is very important in this game as it creates a great emotional effect during some dramatic scenes and plays calming charming melodies during the moments when the danger is away even for a short period of time.\n\n[h1] Conclusion [/h1]\n\nA Plague Tale - Innocence is a perfect game, I am not even afraid to call it a masterpiece and recommend it to every single person who loves quality games with a rich story, satisfying combat system and remarkable atmosphere. It doesn’t event anything new or extraordinary, it just gets the job done and does it in the right way. \n\n[h1] Enjoy!

Solid and very unique story. \nUser interface was a little funky, hopefully they can fix that.\nAt times I kind of felt like I just wanted to finish the game so I can move on but at times I was really enjoying it and didn't want the game to end. There is a point in the game where there was so many rats that my stream was lagging, it was actually funny to me, wasn't upset cause it was pretty intense. Overall it was an o-k game to me, I would highly recommend it if you really enjoy stealth games with a solid story line.\n7.5/10 for me.",Recommended

Super fantastic game. Wonderful story and gameplay. Hope a sequel is made,Recommended
"[h1]Introduction[/h1]\n""A Plague Tale: Innocence"" was released by Focus Home Interactive and developed by Asobo Studio. It is about the persecution of the De Lun family because of the religious trials (seeking the power in the blood of Hugo that the De Rune family will appear every few generations), and Amicia (Elder Sister) with the Hugo(Brother) flees from their castle, they will meet with several partners to save each other along the way. The game has a total of 16 chapters (including the final chapter is 17 chapters), the gameplay time is 15-20 hours (Completionist, if your are not it may only take about 10 hours).\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nCompared to the general stealth game, I prefer to call this game a third-person puzzle game. There are only two types of our enemies in the game: The Inquisition (human enemies, ordinary soldiers, soldiers wearing helmets, heavy armor, bow soldiers, holding torches or glowing sticks in the hands of some enemies in the later period) and The Rats ( afraid of light and will gather to the food, so the puzzle in the game is related to light and food. In the later stage, a whirlpool of rat waves can extinguish the flame). It is indeed a stealth game when it comes into contact with the Inquisition. But as long as the rat appears, even if there is some Inquisition soldier, it will focus on stealth and prefer to solve the puzzle. However, although it is a puzzle, but the game is difficult to stick in one scene, the player's guidance is still sufficient, interactive items will continue to shine white.\nThe components of the game in my mind: 45% puzzle 40% stealth 15% collection\nAmicia's only weapon is a sling. With the upgrade of the equipment, we can make two stones in one charge, shoot all kinds of pharmacy, destroy the soldier's helmet, and attack the head to kill the enemy. The assist aiming of the game is also quite powerful, and it will automatically pull onto the enemy's head (or target). So those who are not good at aiming can play this game happily, but when you are exposed, it will become a very pure shooting game, whether you kill all the enemy first or kill by the close enemy. There are also dodge in the game, but there are very few occasions for it, because the close-up will be killed easily, and the interval between the two dodge is quite long and the visual sense is very strong, but it is not conducive to us to observe the surrounding situation. Except for the first Boss battle in the game, it losts the existential meaning.\nThere are 3 Boss battles in the game, except for the last game that needs to master the attack rules. This is where the game is often criticized: the difficulty is too low. In fact, apart from the final BOSS battle, I didn't feel any difficulty at all - it was really ""you can get through this game as long as you can turn computer on.""\nIt is also very important to collect all kinds of materials. Collecting materials can not only make props but also upgrade equipment, but the number is limited, so it can not be used freely. This is especially important for those who want to achieve the full achievement.As the game progresses, the types of items we can use are becoming more and more abundant. \n\n[h1]Picture and Music[/h1]\nThe game's picture is also remarkable. The scenery during the day can be screenshotd as a wallpaper, and the night is a good atmosphere when facing the rat. In the games I played this year, I can rank this game in the top 5.\nThe other is music: I give full marks, the last time I heard such music that I am satisfied with (referring to this medieval style) or the movie ""King Arthur: Legend of the Sword"". The atmosphere and music have always been very good, and it has also added a lot marks to the game.\n\n[h1]Disadvantages[/h1]\nThis is probably a common problem with games that are larger than indie games but that may not have reached 3A: dropped frames in certain scenes and savings. But the game's loading is very clever (carriage, title), make it greater.\nThe character will only face the direction specified by our right stick when moving, it may be awkward at first, but it is harmless.\n\n[h1]Summary[/h1]\nGood picture, full score music, 15-20 hours of stealth puzzle game experience. I think it's hard for me to find a game that is better than this game this year. If I’ll give a rank, it's roughly the same as ""DaysGone"" and maybe even higher (9 scores).\n\n[h1]介绍[/h1]\n“A Plague Tale: Innocence”《瘟疫传说：无罪》由Focus Home Interactive发行，Asobo Studio开发。讲述的是德·卢恩家族因为受到宗教审判所的迫害（寻求雨果血液中德·卢恩家族每隔几代就会出现的玛库拉的力量），阿米西亚（姐姐）带着雨果（弟弟）逃离，一路上与几个伙伴相遇互相拯救的故事。游戏共有16章（包括终幕则为17章），游戏时间15-20小时（完美主义者，如果中间不怎么搜集的话可能只需要10小时左右）。\n\n[h1]游戏性[/h1]\n相比于一般来说的潜行游戏来说我更愿意把这款游戏成为第三人称解谜游戏。游戏中我们的敌人只有两类：宗教审判所（人类敌人，普通士兵，戴了头盔的士兵，重甲兵，弓兵，到后期一部分敌人手中会持有火把或是发光的杖）和鼠潮（怕光而且会聚集在食物处，所以游戏中的解谜都与光和食物有关。后期会出现漩涡一样的鼠潮可以扑灭火焰）。在和宗教审判所接触时的确是一个潜行游戏。但只要鼠潮出现，就算有宗教审判所游戏也会从专注于潜行而偏向于解谜。不过虽然说是解谜但游戏很难出现卡关的状况，对于玩家的引导还算充足，可以互动的物品也会不断地闪耀白光。\n游戏在我心目中各项的组成部分：45%解谜 40%潜行 15%收集\n阿米西亚的唯一武器就是投石索，随着对装备的升级，我们可以做到连发两颗石块，发射所有种类的药剂，打掉士兵的头盔，攻击头部击杀敌人的操作。游戏的辅助瞄准也相当的强悍，相隔一个身位就会自动牵引到敌人头上（or目标）。所以那些不擅长瞄准的玩家也能很愉快地玩这款游戏，不过如果是在被发现时就会变成一个很纯粹的射击游戏了，到底是你先杀死所有敌人还是先被敌人近身杀死。游戏中也有闪避，但是其适用场合非常少，因为近身就会判负，而两次闪避的间隔还挺大而且视觉虽然代入感很强却不利于我们观察周围的情况，除了第一场勉强能算做BOSS战的对抗村长外实际存在意义不大。\n游戏中共有3场BOSS战，除了最后一场需要摸一下攻击规律外几乎没有难度。这也是游戏经常被批评的地方：难度过低。事实上除了最后的BOSS战我完全没有感到难度——真的是“只要你会开机你就能打通这个游戏”。\n而收集各类材料也非常地重要，收集材料不仅可以制作道具也可以制作装备的升级，不过数量有限，所以并不能肆意地使用。对于想要一周目全成就的人更是如此。\n随着游戏进程的推进我们能使用的物品种类也越来越丰富。石块（我们击倒敌兵最好的方法，需求量虽然很大但是游戏中可收集到的数量也很多），点火剂（中期开拓道路和解谜时最重要的物品），熄灭剂（后期面对拿着火杖的重甲兵时唯一的应对方法），陶罐（除了前期外几乎没什么存在意义，很多关卡中你甚至捡不到一个陶罐），皇权（使役鼠群），耀光剂（消灭一定范围内的鼠群，但是和之后的迷药一样需要消耗的材料过多并非必需品，除了部分收集几乎不使用），迷药（可理解为近身暗杀，有迷药前我们是没法近身暗杀的，一样需要消耗过多材料，非必需品，在后期升级炼金术后可以投出），元息（效果类似于食物，可将鼠群聚集在周围一段时间）。不过相比起其他几类道具，元息出现的时机实在是太晚了，因为没过几章我们就会暂时切换到雨果视角，之后就会掌握皇权，元息就失去了存在意义（到最后2章鼠群已经不会攻击我们了，而比起用需要制造的元息，0消耗的皇权既快速又方便）。而消耗材料较多的耀光剂和迷药使用起来要更为灵活，被鼠群包围（前者）或宗教审判所（后者）近身攻击时会出现按键提示来使用。\n\n[h1]画面、音乐[/h1]\n本次游戏的画面也是可圈可点，白天时候的风景可以截图下来当壁纸，而夜晚面对鼠群时也算是渲染了不错的气氛。在我今年玩过的游戏里可以排到前5的位置。\n另外就是音乐：我给满分，上次听到这么让我满意的音乐（指这种中世纪风格）还是电影《亚瑟王：斗兽争霸》。气氛和音乐一直很搭调，也给游戏增色了不少。\n\n[h1]缺点[/h1]\n这大概是比独立游戏大但制作可能还没到3A的游戏的通病了：在某些场景和存档时掉帧严重。但是游戏对游戏的读取处理非常巧妙（马车，标题），这点是加分项。\n在移动时角色只会面向我们右摇杆指定的方向，不过无伤大雅，只不过对于玩惯了ACT人来说刚开始可能会觉得别扭。\n\n[h1]总结[/h1]\n不错的画面，满分的音乐，再加上15-20小时的潜行解谜剧情游戏体验。我想我很难找到一款比这游戏要好的游戏了（今年内），若我来评分的话大致上与《往日已逝》相同甚至可能要高点（9分）。",Recommended
"There are good games, and there are bad games. Then there's everything in between. This game is none of the above. It's absolutely excellent. If you're wanting a game that gives you an enthralling story with an excellent set of characters, this one's for you. \n\nThere is one set difficulty, and it's simply enjoyable. \nTake note that exploration in this game is ABSOLUTELY rewarded. You'll find yourself scouring every nook and cranny to find what you need for crafting and upgrading your equipment. The simplicity of the story, along with a refreshing take centering on the lives of two siblings caught in the height of the plague's grisly horror, makes for a graphically fantastic and aesthetically pleasing game. The soundtrack, along with reactive dialogue and sound effects, help to finish the immersion by taking you into a story that you'll be driven to finish.\n\nOn a sidenote, it's a really nice walking simulator. Seriously, take some screenshots during the outdoor scenes that you think might be good for a wallpaper and you won't be disappointed.",Recommended
"Very solid. If you like narratives in a market where narratives have taken a back seat to more ""AAA"" experiences then you should do yourself a favor and pick up this gem. Some of the most disturbing visuals in gaming can be found here and although sometimes the dialogue is delivered in a somewhat campy way at times, the story as a whole is interesting and will keep you invested till the end. The content is worth the asking price and it's almost like our duty to buy a quality game so that the industry doesn't forget what these look like now a days. Bravo guys, well done.",Recommended
"I just finished this game and I don't even know where to begin. I LOVED it. These days people say the words ""linear"" and ""story-driven"" as if they're negatives, but if you disagree with those people like I do, then you've got to play this game.\n\nThe story was incredible. I was expecting it to stay much more based in realism than it did (with liberties taken on the exact events, the behavior of the rat swarms, etc), so when it first started veering towards a more fantastical direction I initially felt like it was jumping the shark just a bit. But once I embraced that direction, I was hooked. Of course, the anchor of the entire story is the relationship between Amicia and Hugo, and that...[i]that[/i] felt real. As someone who has personally had the responsibility to take care of my own little brother, Amicia's ferocious protection of Hugo hit me particularly hard, but I think that anyone who plays this game will be moved by their turbulent and heart-wrenching journey.\n\nThe soundtrack was another highlight for me. Every ounce of tension and every tender moment was amplified in a huge way by music that was beautiful but never overpowering.\n\nI really enjoyed the gameplay as well. Stealth is one of my favorite parts of any game it's included in, and while this game's approach to it is quite simple, I think it was effective. The fact that getting seen was almost a guarantee of a quick and violent death had me constantly stressed, as it should--this is not one of those ""stealth optional"" games where if your cover is blown, you can whip out your arsenal of weapons and YOLO your way out of any situation. Also, shout-out to the second to last boss. That entire scene and fight was the peak of what gaming has to offer.\n\nIf I had to find something negative to say about the game, which I don't want to because it was so awesome, it would be that the dialogue was a bit stilted at times. Some of the animations weren't at triple-A quality either (obviously), but the game as a whole still manages to be absolutely stunning, and I say that as a graphics snob. I ran the game at 1440p with an i7-8700 and a GTX 1070, and for the most part had a smooth experience (with a few stutters or frame drops here and there).\n\nSo yeah, that's about it. I look forward to playing it again, bullying everybody I know into playing it, and hopefully, at some point in the future, getting my hands on the sequel that I've heard rumors about. Spectacular game.",Recommended

"I like open world and this isn't, even if there's a fair bit of scope to explore some areas. I like first person and this isn't. I hate followers in games and I was stuck with up to 4 of them most of the way through. I like crafting heaps of different weapons and armour: we're given a sling and no armour. You know what? None of that bothered me at all!...\n\n...this has to be the best few quid I've spent in a long time.\n\nI loved the story which was a smooth blend of historical fact and creative fiction. I liked the mechanics of the game and had great fun at times when I could forget the tension. Music score great, I thought all the characters were believable and there were some really nice twists along the way. Puzzles, treasure hunts, frustration, breath-taking scenery and rats; who could ask for more ? (I like rats)\n\nIf you don't think this is for you, believe me, I didn't either but I'm so glad that I gave it a shot.\n\nI've got a nice feeling that there'll be a sequel, too... hope I'm right.\n",Recommended

Really don't see why picking up a dagger fro some enemies, or not being able to use you sling as a garrote i think is a lost opportunity.

"[b] A Plague Tale: Innocence is a great game BUT [/b]\n\nAs the titel said, it's a fantastic story driven game with amazing characters. However, in my opinion, even though the game is well stitched together - I think the gameplay is dull. If you are considering buying this don't buy it if one of the things you enjoy the most in games are the gameplay for example if you enjoy tough gameplay like that of Dark Souls or precise gameplay like that of Wolfenstein - then maybe this game is not for you. The gameplay is repetative and doesn't evovle much over the chapters in the game. Wouldn't say it get's harder either, it's just the same. \n\nHowever if you are big on the story and character development - then [b] THIS [/b] good friend, is a game for you. \n\nBut keep in mind, I am 10 hours into my game. I have completed all chapters and am just currently trying to get all achievements for it. 10 hours for 45 euro... I've bought games for less which offers atleast 50+ hours of gameplay. I recommend the game for the story, and character development - the beautiful scenes [b]BUT[/b] not for the asking price of 45 euro.",Recommended

One of the best story-driven games out there. A must have.,Recommended
"A good old fashioned story-driven single player game. The stealth and combat mechanics, in which you must rely on a variety of tools with very specific uses, are quite basic and shouldn't be of much difficulty to anyone who plays Thief, or Splinter Cell. The game excels enormously thanks to its superb voice acting, graphics, and storytelling. The setting is relentlessly grim but the game wears its heart on its sleeve; you can tell the writers put a lot of dedication into this. On the downside, the game isn't particularly replayable unless you want to collect every trinket in the game, but every hour of the 12 hour campaign is well worth the money.",Recommended
Extremely prescriptive. Each phase requires an exact solution. Very little freedom of decision. It's a staged event at each level. Infuriatily tedious and without the sence of control. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone who wants an open playing field or who wants freedom of choice. Very lazy programing. Not worth the money.,Not Recommended
"Good game, I enjoyed it. If you are a fan of The Last of Us's game system you will find this one very similar. I spent just under 12 hours beating the game with a lot of exploration. A little shorter than I would have liked, but in my opinion it was worth the $45.",Recommended

To me, it's on par with games like Hellblade and The Last of Us.

Felt much more immersive for me.",Recommended
"Buy it on sale, but decent game :-). The stealth is kinda ""meh"" as you cross into the mid-late game. And story is lackluster in some ways.",Recommended
"Probably one of the more impressive games I have played in the last few years. The game looked to me to be primarily a horror stealth game at first glance, and I was totally cool with that as I tend to appreciate those games. What I didn't expect was to find a wonderfully strong narrative that pulls in a few different directions:\n\nFirstly, the story is pseudo-historical. Based in an English invasion of France while there is a plague running rampant, your characters are trying to dodge the Inquisition. The specifics beyond this are fictional, but this grounds the story in reality in a way that not many others do.\n\nSecondly, while the story is grounded in reality in that way, the meta-plot of the game seems to be revolving around ancient prophecies, something that is like a fantasy story in the real world.\n\nThird, and this one ties the last two together: It is almost like The Goonies, a story about children trying to make their way in a dangerous real world but finding semi-fantastical things along the way. There's a certain feeling that goes along with the story of children trying to come of age through difficult and dangerous events, events that often blur the line between reality and fantasy, like the story of It. This game captures the kind of charm that these stories have.\n\nYet, while I say it has the charm of these type of young people coming of age stories, it is absolutely brutal at moments. Sometimes you'll find you need to do things that are fucked up, because that's what the circumstances demand. So it blends this fantastical plot in a pseudo-historical real world with characters who are coming of age doing things no child should ever really have to deal with. \n\nAll of that comes together to make a truly remarkable game.",Recommended
"Very beautiful, story driven, with more game play than I expected. Perfect representation of an annoying kid. Smooth animations. If you liked Senuas Sacrifice, you'll most likely enjoy this one.",Recommended

"Absolutely stunning visuals and truly moving audio. The music is beautiful and effective. The combat mechanics are smooth and there's multiple ways you can get through areas so that you're in control of how you want to move forward through the story. The character relationships feel real, but some dialogue is a little cheesy. The main character's VA did an amazing job and the brother and sister relationship is so tender and sweet. Their interactions feel and sound very natural.\n\nThe focus is the story and the narrative behind it. The combat is not complicated at all. The UI for changing weapons is a little annoying. The rat AI is astoundingly well polished as well as the human AI. I didn't encounter any bugs in my playthrough. \n\nIf you enjoy a story driven game with puzzles that don't make your head hurt and combat that isn't overly challenging, but still interesting, this is 100% for you.",Recommended
Love it. Don't play if you dislike linear story games though,Recommended
"Amazing visuals, beautiful score, engrossing characters that you care about - this game has it all. One of my favourite games of 2019. The atmosphere is dripping with dread and yet has a beautiful lightness granted to it by the Medieval French theme and the beautiful 2 main leads (a teenage girl and her 5 year old brother). The warmth given to these characters via the voice acting enhances what is already an engrossing story of family heritage and outright disaster featuring the Bubonic Plague. I cannot recommend this game enough, especially when I was sad it was over but I am hopeful for a sequel sometime in the future",Recommended
4 or 5 loooong evenings of great gameplay with a fresh different style.\nLoved it. Want more :D. Paid full price. Absolutely worth the money.\nSo refreshing to get into a different take on gaming from a point of what i understand to be family developers.\nSo sick of mainstream crappy games where the developers give up their totally fresh takes on gaming and listen to bunch of whiners and bent to their will.\nWell these guys didnt care for whiners and just did their thing.\nAnd the game is so much better for it.\nLove it.\nIll gladly pay $60 for the next one.\nPlease charge me.,Recommended
"I absolutely am in love with this game. I personally feel the story is rich and character depth is pretty good. I love apocalyptic titles and stories... so this game filled a deep void I've had for awhile. The controls are good and logical.

"After playing through the entire game, I can best sum this game as: French Dark Souls (but only the ""You Died"" part), mixed with French puzzles, frustrating and often buggy French combat, French Star Wars force powers, and did I mention the story is Extremely French? (This game literally oozes French-tragic-orphan-fairy-tale.) There's literally an, ""all for one and one for all,"" moment that literally had me laughing about how French the moment was (You'll know what moment I'm referring to if you play/played the game.)\n\nThe combat is -EXTREMELY- frustrating sometimes due to inconsistent or buggy moments. Get used to seeing your allies literally run from behind cover head long into a swarm of rats or enemy guards and having to restart entire sections because one of the many orphan children just screaming ""VIVA LA FRANCE!"" as they charge head long into battle with nothing but air between them and swords, spears, arrows, or millions of vermin teeth.\n\nSomething with the graphics of the game causes EVERYTHING to have a weird glow, which causes everything to look like you're suffering from Astigmatism. I had to step away from the game several times just because the weird bloom/double image effect was causing my eyes to genuinely hurt.\n\nI don't think I can recommend the game based on the amount of issues I encountered, the price point, and 100% lack of replay value. \nBe prepared to see ""xyz has died"" or ""xyz was caught"" causing you to restart sections a lot, and expect to have to take breaks from the frankly weird bloom/double-image thing they have going.\n-----------------------------------\nThe story is pretty solid and has some genuinely great moments.\nIf you are somehow able to look past the gameplay bugs, all things considered, this would be a game I would expect at around the $15-20 price point *at launch* not $45 USD. It's a relatively quick game and unless you're a 100% collectable completionist I personally dont see a lot of replay. Wait for a sale, or for the gameplay bugs to be fixed.",Not Recommended
"A Plague Tale: Innocence was a pretty cool game! \n[list]\n[*] Puzzles and stealth sections were just challenging enough to develop a sense of constant urgency. Being challenging enough to keep you relatively occupied, though not too difficult to hold you back for too long. You can then look around for a bit and gather some materials but then it's off to the next section. Though, by late game there were a few sections that required a bit more time to figure out, but not by much. \n[*] The story was engaging and enjoyable. I wanted to keep playing to find out what exactly was going on. I did wish the game took a few more turns in its final narratives, perhaps more darker twists, but by the end I was still satisfied by the story. \n[*] The multiple characters that you meet during the game are all well made and likable in their own ways. And each reacts to the world and story in ways realistic to them and to how anyone would. Each one was very well voice acted, even Hugo's child voice actor. \n[*] Music was superb and really helped to set the tone of the entire ordeal. From the screeching violins, to the melodic guitars, to the melancholy cellos, the music fit very well within the tense, dark, and even sometimes hopeful narrative. \n[*] The game looked utterly amazing. The level of detail was crisp and precise and the game world was positively breathtaking. Characters were well detailed, their movements mostly fluid (save for a few cinematic moments), and the level of environment detail was robust. And the rats were very well rendered and never tanked performance. The game ran at a smooth 60FPS the entire way through.\n[/list]\n\nSome minor spoilers below:\n\nDespite all that, there was some jenkiness to it: the slingshot sometimes would be put away instead of firing, a few times the game would fail to activate something needed (like the smoke-screen for Hugo to get past the guard in the temple), and the dialogue was delivered in a way that characters would be practically talking over each other at times. \n\nAll in all, I still highly recommend this game. It was simply a delight to play.",Recommended
Yes.,Recommended
It's a good game with a good length for a single player narrative game. It could have been more challenging but enjoyable nonetheless.,Recommended
"I am still playing through this game at the time of writing this but I love this game.  The interactions between Amicia and Hugo are heart warming and feel very real to me.  Hugo does not get in the way at all as he is usually holding your hand and can keep up with your run speed.  I actually very rarely leave him anywhere as there is not really a need.  I am greatly enjoying the story and cannot wait to finish it.\n\nI have seen others comment on the fact that the stealth in this game is boring or bland.  In a way they are correct as there are no new mechanics to the stealth.  Hide from view and throw things to distract guards.  While I have not done it, you can fight your way through most later encounters with the right upgrades.  The story even comments on this in certain situations which serves as character growth for Amicia.  However, I found that the stealth was a (in my mind) minor portion of the game.  Generally there are small areas to sneak through with a few guards.  Each chapter will have several chained together areas involving steath, rats or both.  What makes it interesting is the commentary or story that occurs during or after each area.  It was enough to keep me engaged and excited about the game.  I found that just as I was getting used to/bored of the mechanics the game would introduce a new element (new weapons, enemies, or obstacles) that would change it up enough where I was never bored between story bits.\n\nOverall I would definitely recommend this game.\n\n",Recommended
"it's a KINDA good game, its competently made, and the first act is really well written and impactful\nbut the shine starts to fade through the second to the third act, the gameplay and the puzzle solving are simple and starts to overstay its welcome a bit by the end of the game, not anything explicit boring but it gets a bit tiresome, but as it is a storytelling driven game I don't expect much from the gameplay, but would be nice to have two or three ways to solve a puzzle.\nthe biggest problem is the characters, the relationship between the brothers are well explored but the secondary characters you kinda don't give a shit about them, and when someone dies you just shrug and move on, it needed to have moments that they deepen the relationship between the main cast, it needed them to chat, to tell trivia about their lives so I could feel they're alive so when someone dies I'd pause the game to cry, that's a storytelling driven game not Call of Duty, MAKE ME CARE for god's sake, this game is like a rough diamond, there IS a great game inside here, hell even an epic one, but it snatched defeat from the jaws of victory.\nI'd appreciate if the game had some meaningful choices, you make some small choices that are purely cosmetic if what you choose really made any difference would be great, but that's just an afterthought.\ni was really divided if I should give a positive or negative review, if i give a positive review i might trick someone that takes the same issues as me to buy this game thinking is the next The Last Of Us, but at the same time is a good game with excellent potential, the problems are big but they are fixable, not in this game, in a sequel, so that's why I'm giving this game a positive review, it deserves a sequel, so it can improve what is good and fix what is broken, a really good start.",Recommended
"Great game for its story, you really grow attached to the characters as you struggle though their hardships.

"Utterly beautiful, I absolutely love it.\n\nI love to modify games more than I enjoy playing most titles.  This comes from a lack of understanding or acceptance of the gaming industries products, their content, or lack of it.  Story driven single player titles have become a rare treasure these days, you have to search for them quite a bit, or to wait until your beard grows very long.  That is reason number 1 why I enjoy 'A plague tale' so much.\n\nThe reason why I love it ... is how the story is told.  The visual presentation is remarkable, the light in particular grabbed my attention.  Landscapes, character models and architecture are wonderfully rendered, with a lot of detail and atmosphere.  But of course, the visual aspect is only one part in presenting a story, a minor one at times.\n\nWriting, voice acting and the Soundtrack create a tense and dark setting, one that made me feel anxious from the start to the end.  I cannot criticize modern writing, its nature and core, it just is the way it is.  But I can express my impressions of each of those titles and 'A plague tale' has found its way to me easily, I love it!",Recommended

"A single player game that just wants to be a game with a great story?! Say it ain't so!! I picked this up after refunding Rage 2 and I couldn't be happier. It's a fairly basic single player experience with some minor crafting/upgrading involved. You don't need to dedicate your life to the game, just play it and enjoy the great story, voice acting, music, and of course stunning graphics! It's predominately a stealth game, but there's some combat and puzzles in select areas. Plus, you can use the rats to help out with a quick kill. It's part The Last of Us and part Thief, if you want to compare to what's out there. If you're like me an enjoy the single player experience (albeit somewhat linear) without the BS, you will most likely enjoy this game. A 8.5/10 for me. Will buy any DLC that comes out if it expands the story and provides a decent amount of play time.",Recommended

The atmosphere plays such an important part in conveying the story too, as it shifts both gradually and suddenly during certain milestones in the story. The characters are engaging, and somehow they managed to write a little child main character who I don't absolutely hate like most games (in Hugo). The voice acting is incredible, especially given that most of the leads are unknown. On top of that, THIS is how you write a strong female protagonist. No virtue signaling, no heavy-handedness, just a girl thrown into a terrible situation and her struggles to overcome. I found myself utterly engaged nearly the entire time I played (save a few frustrating bits with some strangely placed checkpoints and difficult encounters) and almost decided to pull an all-nighter to finish the game because of how much I wanted to see the resolution. Overall, I highly recommend this game and hope to see more from Asobo in the future, because I really had a blast playing this!",Recommended
"A beautiful, under-marketed marvel from a small French team. Definitely recommended for those who thoroughly enjoy stealth that can be played out differently depending on surroundings. This game does not condone brute force,  as the main character is a young woman armed with a sling. As gruesome and hopeless as the conditions presented are, the main character always finds a way, whether by herself, or with the help of companions. This game sucked me in, and every time I thought it was over it picked back up again. 10/10",Recommended
Fantastic game if you like story games (games with a heavy focus on story and very little gameplay) then youll love this game!,Recommended
"This game kinda came out of nowhere but it's absolutely fantastic. The story is awesome and while I could guess parts there was so much to keep me going. And it's quite a long game too - I was expecting six hours or so but it kept going and going which is always a pleasant surprise. Very good sountrack too. This studio deserves to get the attention of the big leagues for this one! Only downside is the animation is a tiny bit wooden and the voice acting sounds like people trying to be french rather than actually just being french, but towards the end I loved the characters anyway. Will keep an eye out from more by this dev for sure.",Recommended
"Many things are original in this game :\nthe period and the topic of the game, i don't remember any game about plague during this period\nthe gameplay and the mechanics, use your head not your strength.\nthe characters, a nice duo carried by the girl.\n\nBeside this, it's beautiful with nice graphique, the music serve well the gameplay and the story is nice also. You want to continu until to save those 2 characters.\n\ndidn't now that a full created french game could be that good !",Recommended

"A little expensive for the play time you get out of it. Unless you're a completionist, you'll only get about 12 hours out of this game. It's very pretty and atmospheric and creepy, and the characters are likeable, but the story is straightforward and the gameplay is very linear. Each chapter is essentially a sequence of puzzles sometimes disguised as simple action sequences, but there is very little difficulty to this game.\n\nThey give you the tools and prepare you for combat that you'll only face a handful of times in the entire game. They make a point to show you that you can temporarily let go of your little brother's hand to solve some puzzles, but only require it once or twice beyond the prologue. Many of the abilities you unlock are only really useful in a few key points.\n\nThat said, this is certainly an enjoyable experience, and each step of the way, you want to see what's going to happen next.  Worth a playthrough, but wait until it goes on sale. There's very little replay value to this game beyond a few collectibles with no in-game effects.\n\nThis game is made by a French studio, and the French voice acting is pretty solid. The English voices have horrible accents and playing the game in French is a much more enjoyable experience, especially for native French speakers.",Recommended

"A Plague Tale: Innocence is an experience before a videogame. A masterpiece nonetheless. Along with other games like The Last of Us and many others (indy games or not), this is undoubtedly a title to take in serious consideration not necessarily for his difficulty level but for the story and characterization. Setting and characters are really something, music and effects are impressive. Enemy AI is definitely not bad at all. A bit short maybe it can give not much more then 20 hours of gaming experience but is so intense that maybe you would like to play it again. Lets hope there will be another one...",Recommended

"Amazing! Just simply amazing!\nThis game is beautiful with it's open world graphics and design and the scene changes throughout the game, never the same twice. Which make you think of new ways to counter. The game allows you to choose how tackle problems when it comes to enemies. Whether you sneak pass them or kill them. Love it how you are given those options. And when coming across enemies, don't expect your typical Assassin's creed, whistle so many time from a hiding spot to get them to move. There is only a limited amount of distractions you can make before they bring everyone on high alert. \nThe game has a lot of puzzles to get through but they really make you think. You have to be observant of the surrounds to find ways to get to the goal but the games does spoon feed you hints and warnings.\nOf course, there are little side quest that tend to be forgotten or never known until you look at the achievements but at least the game gives you the options of going back into chapters you have completed. \nThey really did well with the story. It's just one that sticks in your mind. There are moment of happiness and hope but they do bring you into the darkness and death quite quickly . But it has certainly brought in the settings of what it was like back in the 1300s. Though it would be nice it was a little longer.\nBut the chapters are reasonably timed, though there was one that was short but they were good. \nThe characters are interesting, the main characters are unique in their design and their personality. However it's a shame that the side character don't get as much detail as the main character or there are some minor characters that have great design but don't appear or last long. It's nice that the game gives us some backstory to each of the characters but not too little that we are left with how did that character ended up here in the first place. \n\nAll in all? Is it worth it?\nYes, yes it is. \nIt's it worth full price?\nI would say...\nYes for this kind of game for $60AU. \nDo I want to see a sequel?\nYes",Recommended
"I definitely recommend the game as it is excellent, but it is only 12 hours long, so I'm not sure if $45 is worth the play time.  I would say try to catch it on a sale, it's well worth $30 easily.\n\nTerrific story and characters.  The acting is very well done and all the characters are endearing.  The gameplay is pretty decent, interesting puzzles created in a unique way 90% of the time, there's a few that are just tedious.  The graphics are gorgeous, although the character models were subpar compared to the environments.\n\nThere's really only 2 complaints: it's too short and I don't think they had any facial animations, so the characters always had the same deadpan look when talking, regardless of the emotion (ME3 ""my face is tired"", although not as bad).\n\nIf you want a unique experience, such as a triple-A title that actually focuses on a good story and well-written characters, then definitely pick it up.",Recommended
Amazing story,Recommended
"This game was really good, the music was phenomenal some of the tracks reminded me of songs from the witcher series. Voice acting was really good and each characters voice fit the personalty of each character and emotional moments were really good because of the really good voice acting. I would recommend this game to anyone who likes a good narrative but if you do have musophobia I would recommend giving this game a pass.",Recommended
"This game was truly amazing, it has to be one of the best games i've played this year so far. The characters were great and you slowly get to know them throughout the game which is awesome. The graphics are fantastic and the soundtrack for the game is great and goes along with the game perfectly.\nReally great story driven game with a mix of stealth and puzzles and a bit of combat which keeps things nice and interesting. \n\nDefinitely worth picking up if you have some spare money and you think you might be interested in it. i know i didn't regret it!",Recommended
You can't turn off aim assist. Theres only two options normal and low. No thanks I dont need an aim assist. Everything else is fine.\nAnd you can't turn off annoying chromatic aberration effect in the game options so I had to go to games settings file and turn it off manually.,Recommended
AMAZING!,Recommended
"This game is not perfect and its story is kind of bland and cliché, but the set pieces are beautiful and believable.\n\n14th century France and its towns, alleys and countryside look absolutely gorgeous and even the horrific scenes of gallows, dead cows and rotting corpses are exquisite to look at. \n\nThe problem, in my opinion, is the story. This game deserved a better story. The story consist of trope upon trope upon trope and despite an engaging Last of Us mechanic in which you are tied to a child that you are protecting, it never succeeded in gripping me. The beginning was strong, the middle act was okay, and the ending was lackluster and trite.\n\nShould you buy it? If you like some escapism in a fantasy tale with 14th century France as its backdrop, YES, go ahead. But unfortunately there is no good story to accompany the beautiful images that you will see.\n\nPS\nSuprisingly, though for a game from a French studio, the French voice acting is significantly worse than the English voice acting. So, no need to go native for this game and better stick to English voices.",Recommended
"I really enjoyed this game.  It's a nice, complete story.\n\nThe game keeps the action and puzzles fresh by throwing new items at you every so often.",Recommended
"I'm a sucker for story-driven action-adventure games. So, this is right up my alley. Its story is well written with loveable characters. \nThough it's not an action game per se the game has its moments. The stealth sequences and the boss fights were well designed. The soundtracks in this game were awesome. Got to appreciate the art-direction as well. Some of the environments were breathtaking. \n\nYou don't get many of these kinds of games these days especially in PC.  So, if you love linear story-driven single player games like me, buy it. You won't be disappointed.",Recommended
"For me, A Plague Tale: Innocence, is like a eat a very good meal in a gastronomic restaurant. Not so much to eat but quality, that is why I play the game with very short sesssions: like 10-20 minutes to be sure I enjoy every seconds.\nThe game is quite short and I don't want to rush it. \n\nGraphics are impressives, some plans are even photo-realist. The developers made a top-notch work on the ambiance and the story which it make them pretty immersive.\n\nI did not know at all A tale of plague: Innocence a few days ago but after seeing some videos, I bought it. It's rare that I buy a game at full price without having reading tests or reviews and I do not regret.\n\nHowever a couple of bad things: I've some micro-stuttering despite my very good rig.\n\nI recommend A Plague Tale: Innocence, even at full price. A must have !",Recommended
" A game that in many ways should just be a generic and forgettable adventure game with its basic stealth mechanics, basic puzzles, and basic upgrades, ammo crafting systems, and scripted chase sequences; but it understands the power of great context, presentation, and direction to completely surpass these things. It's a game more than the sum of its parts, a story deeply compelling and drenched in misery full of horrific imagery and incredible music that had me hooked from the beginning and only finding myself more invested as the hours went by.\n\n The price you pay for this game is for an 11 hour game with not a tonne of replay value, but those hours were memorable, full of interesting moments and incredible artistic designs and character moments that had me consistently leaning towards the screen in anticipation....I really liked it :)",Recommended
"I still feel like it's a bit on the expensive side, but you do get 15 levels of decent size and the story is fantastic. The kids are fun to watch, and play as. There have been a few oddities. For instance, i found a tomb inside the castle, wandered around for a while, then left., then i found out that it's supposed to activate an achievement? Maybe i just did something wrong, but some of them seem a bit quirky. There were also a few times when the friendly ai kind of wandered into rats for no reason and died. o.O",Recommended
"A Plague Tale: Innocence is an absolutely gorgeous game with beautiful graphics, lovable characters and a refreshing story. The game focuses heavily on stealth, valuing strategy over combat, and does a magnificent job at making the stealth mechanics worthwhile. \n\nHowever, despite A Plague Tale being a beautiful game, it feels more like a skeleton of a full game. The game was said to heavily focus on the growing bond between Amicia and Hugo, yet we didn't get to see any of that happen beyond Amicia getting mad once and apologizing. Characters were rapidly introduced and sidetracked, giving little to no time to even care about them. \n\nAll in all, the game failed to deliver the most fundamental thing it sought to deliver; growing relationships and bonds. As a result, we played through a story and simply watched it unfold, indifferent to the fate of the characters. The game was a race to the finish line and it shows.\n\nMore so, the game is a bit expensive for something that can be finished under 11 hours.",Not Recommended
"One of the best single player games I've ever played. Beautiful visuals, great soundtrack that's very fitting, and characters and a story you actually care about. Looking forward to the sequel.",Recommended
"I was immensely excited for this game and am glad I decided to get it now and play it.  One of the best single player experiences of the past few years.  It excelled where many others have failed; a good protagonist, giving the player emotional attachment in very little time, lore and world building, beautiful graphics with very little glitches.  My only complaint is that I couldn't agree with the villain, he seemed to be evil with no rationalization to sway me to begrudgingly agree with him (as all good villains have, ex: the Fireflies in Last of Us, Thanos in Avengers, etc).  Game had very little (if any) choice and is very on rails, but it's intended to tell a story (one which it tells very well).  Those are really my only complaints.  Solid 10 hours or so, would recommend.",Recommended

"A Plague Tale: Innocence is my personal game of the year. It's as simple as that.\n\nIf you're worried about getting your hopes up, here are a couple things:\n1. The gameplay isn't challenging. That's okay though, as it is still interesting thanks to their varying up and adding of mechanics throughout the game.\n2. While the game looks and performs incredibly well, there are some sections where a lower budget than what you'd expect from top tier console exclusives comes through, and that's whenever characters besides your main set are talking. Their animations aren't great.\n3. The story goes a bit off the rails, but your opinion on that'll depend on your ability to suspend your disbelief. I personally loved the story throughout. \n\nAgain, these are just to set your expectations accordingly. Even with all of these, A Plague Tale: Innocence is easily my personal game of the year, and I really hope as many players as possible get a chance to experience this beautiful game.",Recommended

"Completed the game in 12 hours. Great, immersive gameplay mainly focused on stealth. Amazing story but leaves a lot untold and me wanting to find out more, definitely would recommend playing but $50 for a 12hour game is a little steep in my opinion. If a sale comes along, definitely pick this game up!\n\ntl;dr: Great but short. Pick it up during a sale.",Recommended
"Finally a linear focused, story and character driven game. Great graphics with amazing landscapes, memorable locations and scenarios, makes this game close to outstanding. \nThe voice acting is top notch and all speak with a French accent. Giving it an authentic setting. \nThe rats may not look detailed but then, there are hundreds of them and still look fearsome that will devour anyone in seconds to the bone if you step in their path. Still questionable how they can eat so quickly through a heavily armoured knight in seconds, as it takes for none armoured person. \n\nAlso it is a one-hit-kill game like Alien Isolation. Once an enemy gets you, it's over. \nStealth is desired and killing only secondary. Although towards the end you are killing quite a lot of bad guys. \nYou have your trusted slingshot that can be upgraded and you have many types of ammunition that allow you to extinguish flames, throw acid on enemies helmets that they are forced to remove them for the required head-shot. You can also create an explosive to free a path of rats or eliminate them in a small area.   \n\nThe AI however, has its issues. Frequently enemies see how their friends are being eaten and they stand there like nothing happened. Also when their friends are being eaten alive, screaming in agony not even five meters away from them, they do nothing. \nThey seem to lose quickly track of you once you are out of sight. Even more hilarious is that they investigate a sound you have created, like throwing a porcelain pot to lead them away from your path. Clearly seeing the pieces, they say that there is nothing and return to their programmed post. \n\nNevertheless, it is a great game that is still challenging and has its graphic moments like a huge pile of dead bodies of men and animals.",Recommended
"Everything is good for this game, but controlling mice into little tornadoes is way off the middle age background as i feel.  The last boss fight was too much of a magic show.   Besides this, it is still a solid game to play.",Recommended
It could have definitely been better.,Recommended
"I enjoyed the premise of the game but I felt like it went in the wrong direction. I think if they played into a survival aspect of the story it would have been more fun. \n\nThere was features in the game that I never used nor saw a reason to use. For example, in the game you have the option to let go of your little brothers hand so you can stealth around easier but the level design didn't really permit a reason to do so.\n\nThere is a type of ammo that you can use to silently knock someone out, but there is no need to use it because you can just use a rock and kill them instead. On top of that, there is dialog in the game that questions your choice to kill enemies but there is no moral difference at the end.\n\nThere was tons of moments in the game where they try to tug at heart strings with scenic views or death but they all seem to fall flat. Like if you were a 5 year old kid and you watched people get ate alive by rats I would expect you to panic way more then just something stale like, ""stupid mean old rats!""\n\nI wish the plague was a bit more prevalent. Like there is plenty of scenes where the there are sick / dead people but it never really showed people being displaced. If anything head a heartbeat it was chewed up by rats.\n\nFor $45 it was a very short game.",Recommended
"If you have not yet purchased this game, listen up. For an unbiased, yet critical review of this game read on. If you have been searching for a Historical/Fantasy version of The Last Of Us/Alan Wake, then this is the game for you. First, here are some quick pro/cons, then I will write an explanation.\n\nPros:\n-Pretty Graphics\n-Cool/Unique storyline\n-Likeable Characters\n-Awesome landscapes\n-Certain scenes are done really well, and are properly dramatic\n-Ambiance/Rats really creepy and well done\n\nCons:\n-Mechanics can get a bit repetitive/dull\n-Facial expressions aren't great, some emotion is lost in this\n-Drama could have been done better to be more impactful at times\n\nIf you're wondering wtf you're getting into, this game is basically a historical fantasy version of The Last Of Us, and so I will compare it to that. Literally it plays almost exactly the same, only with more craftables, and clunkier mechanics. (Single player campaign is the whole game FYI.) They try to keep the gameplay fresh by adding different things (items/enemies/puzzles) as the game goes on, but it's mostly more of the same. In this way it suffers from the same issue TLOU did, in that it's gameplay is somewhat stale. TLOU had better facial expressions, which helped their drama. And TLOU's story writing was better. There were far more scenes in that game that really got your blood pumping or your heart wrenching than there were in this game. I was way more /invested/ in those characters, than I was in these. But that is just my opinion.\n\nThe game was fun, pretty, unique, and moving at times. I loved the rats, the historical aspects of it, the alchemy, and the environments. I would definitely recommend it if you're a fan of TLOU or story driven games. But it is not nearly as good as TLOU was, in my opinion. (Granted, that was one of my favorite games ever, so I may be a bit biased.)\n\nCool game, not disappointed that I spent my money on it.\n",Recommended
Original experience. Great dialogue. Near perfect.,Recommended
"Amazing premise and world-building. Serviceable story that seems to go adrift from time to time towards the end. Bland characters, especially side ones, which hurt the intended impact of some moments. Solid gameplay -- essentially a 3rd person stealth game with puzzles, crafting elements and action. Surprisingly high level execution, with a very polished presentation, especially for a studio that I never heard of. Difficulty is low to moderate for most of it, but I found the last boss especially challenging. Pretty much no replayability.\n\nThe overall feeling I was left with was very positive, along with a sense that it could easily have been even better. It left me very interested in what they're doing next.\n\nEdit: I almost forgot: amazing soundtrack! It can be a bit overbearing at times during play but it made its way to my car now.

"I cant say too much about the game without spoilers, but the best way i can describe it is a medieval ""The last of us"" replacing zombies with plague rats.

It picks up a bit at the end of the game, but \n* RPG 2/5: Possibly because its so easy, the RPG feels pretty useless. I mostly participated because of my ocd for economic efficiency, but in reality i think the game would be practically just as easy with 0 upgrades.\n* Value 3/5: The game is great, and i do recommend it, but if you are trying to maximize gametime for your dollar, this may not be the game for you\n* Replayablity 1/5: Practically none.\n\n\n\n",Recommended

"A Plague Tale: Innocence is a brilliant, moving and visually stunning stealth/horror game set in a Gothic 14th century France ravaged by war, religious fanatics and a super natural rat plague that is consuming everything in it's path. The story and direction are top notch. It's presentation is better than most AAA games. The cast is extremely well acted. Every actor gives a great performance which is doubly impressive considering most of the cast are kids. The story is gut wrenching and powerful. The relationship between the protagonist Amicia and her brother Hugo is wonderfully developed. Amicia is a teenager forced to deal with horrible trauma and a difficult, sheltered brother suffering from a terrible illness. The story takes many twists and turns and truly shines as a something different from most games on the market. The gameplay, while fun, is very derivative of Naughty Dog games such as the Last of Us. That is good and bad. The focus on story and visuals is apparent and extremely skillful. However the game is quite linear sometimes to a fault. It rarely lets you solve a problem your own way. Also, certain parts of the game simply aren't well made and feel out of place. Especially the final boss. That said the limited combat is a lot of fun. Amicia is armed with a sling that is satisfying to use and rewarding to upgrade. Overall, A plague Tale: Innocence is one of the best games to come out this year. It is a powerful, moving adventure about two siblings forced to survive in a cruel and unforgiving world. If you like narrative and can accept the game's hand holding you'll love it as much as I did. If nothing else it's an amazingly well made game from a small studio not attached to any major publisher, much like 2017's Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice, it's proof that high quality games with stunning visuals and brilliant stories on the level of AAA games don't need to be focus tested and watered down by big publishers.",Recommended
"this game surprised me in it's quality. it combined history with fiction, a delecate balance that I believe it managed to maintain, making the world seem believable. this is all delivered with incredible voice acting and attention to detail in the explorable environment. the game makes a great job in adding and introducing mechanics as the game progressess, so as to keep the gameplay from getting dull.\n \nPROS:\n\n- thriling and immersive adventure\n- good voice acting and believable characters\n- unique puzzle ideas\n- rich story\n- hidden secrets in the beautifull environment.\n\nCONS\n\n- the puzzles are not at all challenging, you would need to think and act and they are not at all dull gameplay. but after you solve a puzzle you won't get that sense of accomplishment that other puzzle games offer. I believe that this gameplay holds very well, yet take in mind that this is definetly a story focused game.\n- no replay value. which is a shame since there are many secrets hidden in the beautyfull environment, it's just that replaying chapters after you know the story is uninteresting due to the fact that the gameplay as I've said before is not challangeing.",Recommended

"This game is a gem, it's one of those games that comes out that grabs you nearly instantly. It looks impressive technologically, but the reality is that it's just a DX11 engine that's very purpose built. That's not to say the coders were poor or mediocre, but they're not at a level of say id software's Vulkan renderer. These guys are pretty good but still clinging to DX11.\n\nWhere this game shines is in the incredible talent of their artists. To do a PBR implementation like this takes some serious artistic insight that goes hand in hand with technical knowledge and their artists have it. The story writing, although I'm very early in the game, also seems to be great. Their audio design is impeccably good with great ambiance, tasteful music with great use of stringed instruments that match the tone of the game and its setting. The voice acting is excellent and the animation was captured and framed at a level you'd expect from a much bigger budget. This developer used their resources to great extent.\n\nThe game lacks some things, like an open world, but it more than makes up for it with succinct storytelling and brevity. Regardless of how much time I will spend in this game's world, I will want more. It's similar to how I felt at the end of Blood and Wine in Witcher 3. After well over a hundred hours, I would just look for any excuse to keep playing whether it was to track down some obscure line from a character, collectible, or achievement. I feel like that will be the case in this game. I'll wander around buildings just to look at the details, I'll look around the forests when I can just to see it all.\n\nThis game makes me want to see where ever hand of the developers crafted something, be it the sights, sounds, or feelings. \n\nThis is just a first impression and I will update this review once I have completed the game.\n\n[Edit]\n\nThis game appears to take advantage of Steam's controller API natively. When you plug in a DS4 controller, you get the correct button prompts ingame as well as full customization support. Verified this on the Switch Pro controller, Steam, and Xbox One controllers. This is outstanding support by the part of a developer. I was very pleased to see this, ontop of all the other aspects about this game.\n\nAfter completing the game, I feel pretty comfortable keeping what I said above. I got through to the end, watched the credits and epilogue, and this is a polished relatively low-bugs launch. This level of polish is only found in AAA games a few months after launch. This dev, however, polished and worked out what I suspect to be a great many issues before launching and it shows.\n\nI really do hope to see more from Asobo and Focus Home. Great dev and what seems to be a great publisher. Sign me up for the next adventure.",Recommended

So its lenght can frustrate some people. For me, it was the perfect game size. \n\nI would score: 9/10.",Recommended

"I'll reiterate what I've said in the discussion forum of this game and say, ""it's linear...AND I LOVE IT!!!""\n\nIn this day in age of gaming, it's all about the open world sandboxes and 100+ hours you can plug into a game. And while I do not hate sandbox games, and there's a lot of them that I DO like, there are also a bunch of them that have TOO MUCH to do in terms of fluffy sidequests leaving the main quests and story very very thin.\n\nWhat I love about A Plague Tale: Innocence is that it is really really focused. The story moves along at about the right pace it needs to all the while finding casual ways for you to practice the fundamental stealth and slinging mechanics as soon as you start the game. It wastes no time in showing you the ropes and getting the story started.\n\nSpeaking of the story, it is incredibly well written and just comes to show how much potential video games have for compelling storytelling. You play as Amicia a 15 year old French princess who is orphaned when The Inquisition comes to her castle seeking to kidnap her little brother Hugo. Your objective is to protect your little brother, who you haven't seen for most of his life, from all the would be kidnappers--all the while trying to survive the plague of rats swarming all over France.\n\nI've had legit feels throughout this game and I think I'm only halfway through it, if not almost. The sibling relationship unfolds in a very natural way. You get moments where Hugo wants to be a normal kid, but he can't be because not only does he have a mysterious illness that has kept him locked up and isolated in his castle, but also because The Inquisition want to take him for a reason I've yet to discover.\n\nThis leads to a lot of conflict between Amicia and Hugo where she needs to protect him at all costs, even if it means robbing him of any happiness and comfort because you're almost always on the run from danger. This takes its toll on him as he is just a little innocent boy thrust into all this violence and bloodshed, as well as for Amicia who has never taken in a life before. Now she's forced to choose whether or not she wants to be a murderer all for the sake of Hugo's and her own survival.\n\nNow I can go on forever about the story, but I'm sure you wanna hear about the gameplay. Well, let's just say that at least for me, it's enough gameplay to make me feel involved in the experience. It's a lot of diversion based stealth with OPTIONAL murder, and the interesting thing about the murdering is that you can hear a change in Amicia's voice over time the more you kill. It takes a toll on her conscience and that makes the experience feel grounded in reality. She's not your typical bad ass and blood thirsty hero, she's a regular young girl forced to make tough decisions.\n\nDon't expect too much bad ass stealth takedowns akin to Assassin's Creed or Batman games, but at least to me I still think it's pretty bad ass to sling rocks at dude's heads as well as KO them with a sleeping elixir. \n\nThe puzzles are also well done, they rival the puzzles found in Tomb Raider games, though not as elaborate, they can be equally satisfying to solve. Some of them require you commanding secondary characters to do different things and that's a neat way to use them as opposed to having them stand by the sidelines watching the main hero carry the team. This game makes you feel like you are actually as helpless as a 15 year old girl would be and would require some additional help while also having her own level of competence for survival to grow.\n\nDefinitely recommend if you want a short and concise experience, and also definitely worth the price in my opinion. This isn't a game you play only once and forget about it. To me this is a story I would like to experience at least one or two more times later down the line like good movies and TV series I've rewatched over the years because there's a lot of details you might miss the first time. \n\nFull price or sale, this is definitely worth your money if you're looking for a gaming experience that has a definite ending and has the linearity of the good old games of yesteryear, mixed in with modern realistic graphics and compelling writing.",Recommended

Very hesitant to give this a bad review because the story is intricate and its atmosphere is great.

"The good:\nThe sound design is awesome, it is really fitting and just pulls you in. The gnarly sounds just add some much to the game giving you a feeling like you are surrounded by death. The graphic's are also pretty good. The story is okay, some parts i really do not care for*, but it is okay\n\nThe bad:\nThe characters are all straight up annoying, none of the characters i liked or even cared about. I also had some gameplay probably with the npc's, as I often had that mellie or lucas thought it was a good idea to stand in the middle of a path and be immediately found by the enemies. In addition, the acting is not very good, I often found myself laughing at how fake the voice acting sounded. Hugo was such an annoying character, I sincerely did not care about the kid at all. Not a fan of kid characters in games in general, and he certainly did not help that. \n\nI do recommend the game, because i really like do think that the developers had this great story that they wanted to tell, but it just sorta got lost on them. However that being said, i don't think it the full price worth, like a 10-15% discount and then i think it is worth looking into it. \n\nSpoilers*:\nThe story was a bit predictable and i am not that much of a fan of the ""magic"" stuff in it. It just sorta takes away from the rest of the game. Like the alchemy part is very well thought out and it fits really well, and then their is the magical-rat-bullshit-power and it sorta took away from the things already established in the world. \n\n\n\n",Recommended

For those who enjoy a thrilling story, this is the game for you.\nThis being said, the gameplay feels lacking. NPC's are simple, and predictable, the puzzles are simple, and the stealth system is very basic. It feels very much as though gameplay was an afterthought. \nUltimately though, and extremely enjoyable, story driven game.",Recommended
"""A Plague Tale"" is a memorable, cinematic, story-driven stealth game with some light puzzling and combat. I thought the setting was great and the implementation of rats was very well done. Most of the puzzles revolve around manipulating light sources to either clear a path through the flood of rats or push them towards your enemies. Stealth is a prominent part of the game and is pretty basic (you use noises to distract enemies so you can sneak past) but it's compelling enough. There's also a surprising amount of ranged combat. You use your trusty sling to hurl various projectiles at enemies or items they're carrying. Once upgraded, the sling is really quite lethal, to the point where you can wipe out groups of enemies with relative ease. There's a ton of aim assist as well, even with a mouse. Usually I'd be offended by this but A Plague Tale isn't meant to be a shooter so I can forgive it. If an enemy hits you, it's instant death so I understand the need to minimize potential frustration.\n\nWith that said, you're probably more concerned with the story and presentation if you're playing a game like this. In that respect, A Plague Tale mostly delivers. It looks really nice, the voice acting is solid, the characters are memorable and there are a lot of dramatic set-pieces. The story is interesting though it kind of goes off the rails towards the end. As with all cinematic, story-driven games, A Plague Tale is a mostly linear and scripted affair, though there are some open-ended areas that reward exploration. There are also a fair amount of collectibles to find. The pacing is pretty tight and the entire experiences lasts about 10 hours. This kind of game is becoming pretty rare these days so I highly recommend picking this up if you want to see more like it.\n\nAlso, the game has ratnadoes.",Recommended

The puzzles however are not hard at all and could have been done better. But that does not take away from the game in my opinion.\n\nIf you want to play a truly fantastic single-player experience with a fantastic story, world and characters, this is the game for you.",Recommended
"Wow, what a great game. \n\nFor all the triple ""A"" companies that think the single player, story telling, rpg is dead, think again. This is what we want.\n\nFor me, its worth the asking price and I hope they create DLC or make a sequel.\n\nLoving it so far. A must buy.",Recommended

"I can already foresee BAFTA nominations for this absolute gem of a game. Asobo Studio and Focus Home Interactive did an absolutely praiseworthy job here. The voice acting done here is superb and keep in mind this does not have renowned voice actors like Troy Baker or Nolan North. Graphics are also nice but the environment and setting is really cold and dark and horrifyingly beautiful and puts you in the shoes of the de Rune siblings to make you experience the loss and tragedy. NPCs are not forgettable and the music is really gut wrenching and evokes emotions pretty strongly which is a cherry on the cake. Playing in French audio and keeping the HUD off provides with a really immersive experience. The facial animation is not as phenomenal as The Last Of Us but it's good. There are a few technical issues like cutscenes in 30fps and a few jitters here and there but this is not one of those AAA $60 full priced title from publishers like Ubisoft.\n\nThere are many striking similarities between this game and The Last Of Us if I may be so bold. A Plague Tale: Innocence takes a lot of inspiration from the 2013 major hit in terms of stealth-driven gameplay and the sombre narrative. Although it goes without saying that TLOU is definitely better, A Plague Tale: Innocence also strikes the same chords. It has a really well written script that is acted out perfectly and executed in the best possible manner. It has that console exclusive quality without having a gargantuan publisher backing it. This game deserves more love and the developers and publishers the utmost respect and praise for making such a coruscating game.\n\nA sweet 9/10.",Recommended

"This is a narrative based game - which means that it suffers from the same weakness as ""The Last of Us"", ""Rise of the Tomb Raider""  and any of the ""Uncharted"" games - which means that there is little to no replay value to be had.\n\nThat said, I beat the game two times in my 24 hours of game time, each time I obtained all of the collectibles, however on my second play through I did a 100% completion, doing all achievements (I only missed 4 on my first run-through, but I re-did them all anyway).\n\nSo, since this game is carried on its story - how was it?  Honestly it's passable if a bit on the shallow side.  The puzzles are fun but a bit straight forward, and the amount of resources the player gets are finite, but plentiful.\n\nOne of the issues that I have is the resources and the upgrades - it appears the entire game can be beaten with no upgrades at all, which trivializes the upgrade system.  Moreover, there are near useless and entirely useless upgrades in the game.  (The Tier 1 ""stealth"" upgrade does nothing if you're already being stealthy, and the Tier 3 of that same tree LITERALLY has no use (Unlimited tools for upgrades) as the game gives you 5 more ""tools"" than there are potential upgrades in the game (and beyond that, the thing that limits the speed of your upgrades is the static resources the game gives you, not the tools)\n\nWith that said, the first upgrade that you should get is ""Pockets"" as it will dramatically increase the speed you get upgrades in the game.\n\nUltimately the gameplay changes, similarly to the other games I mentioned earlier - You start out afraid of everything, and at the mid-point of the game you have so many ways to kill anything that stands in your way that you stop hiding.  The only downside of this is, many game mechanics fall by the wayside, such as distracting enemies with pottery or noise.  Once you get the ability to de-helmet enemies, nothing in the verse can stop you.\n\nThat said, the game is about 10 dollars too much at it's current price, but still a good game.",Recommended

Enjoyed the game a lot. Really liked the story. Glad I decided to buy it not knowing much about it.,Recommended
This is a beautiful game with impressive attention to detail. I'm only 2 hours in but already I love it.,Recommended

RATS!!\n\n,Recommended
Best game i've played in a while.,Recommended
This is my game of the year.\nThis game truly is a masterpiece and I congratulate the team who developed this you really knocked this out of the park!,Recommended
"This is by far the most beautiful looking game I've ever played. My respect and admiration goes out to the environment artists of this game. Fantastic job on that. It inspires me to learn some 3D to make beautiful scenes like they did. The introduction to certain phases is very photogenic with great level design that never lets you get lost. Then again, it is fairly linear. \n\nVoice acting is pretty cool too. In particular, I got goosebumps at the end of the game when [spoiler] Vitalis battles you and his first line is in that threatening, booming voice ""DIE! BECOME ONE AGAIN!"" Chills. Every time. [/spoiler]\n\nThe Stealth aspect is good enough. The game does require you to absolutely stick right against a cover spot and have the camera lean to let you know you're definitely not going to be detected now; although finding that sweet spot behind covers is sometimes tricky since Hugo will decide to move before settling down next to you, inadvertently pushing you. This happened rarely however. \nThe enemies don't react to your other followers so that's good because once [spoiler] I took cover with Hugo and there was no place for Rodrick, so he was super visible just crouched beside my spot, while a guard walked straight up to him and slid him aside while turning around to continue his patrol path. Hilarious to actually see that. [/spoiler] \n\nThe Crafting and looting aspect is... existent. There isn't really much of a need to hoard your resources. You find stuff in the environment any time you need it. I never had any situation where I was out of materials to craft something so that's good enough to help you just stay focused on getting from Point A to Point B stealthily. I completed the game without really upgrading any tools. \n\nThe story is engaging. Might get slightly drawn out towards the end, but nothing felt annoying or pointless. In my opinion it strikes the right balance between historical accuracy and fiction. \n\nThe only con (to me) is that you can't WALK in this game with a keyboard. I wanted to just walk and take in the beautiful visuals, but you need a controller for that. I suppose that's Recommended for many games but a key to toggle between the jog - walk cycles would have been perfect for me. \n\nAnyway, it's a great game for its price. \nI'd recommend it to anyone looking for a good story driven single player, third person, stealth-ish game.",Recommended
"Great story, good gameplay.",Recommended
"Masterful storytelling backed up by a superb soundtrack, compelling characters, stunning visuals, insane amounts of polish and attention to detail.\nFor some the gameplay might be slightly lacking, but I personally found it quite enjoyable, there was more then enough depth to the stealth mechanics to keep me well entertained to see the story through to the end.\n\nif you enjoy a quality story you wont be disappointed, highly recommended.",Recommended

"Amazing game and art style, one of the greatest endings I've seen.",Recommended
"I was admittedly on the fence as to whether to buy this as the premise of the game interested me but I like to know what it is I'm buying before buying it. What really got my attention was the number of glowing reviews it got, including from a number of more prominently known critics in a short period of time after its launch, so I decided to give it a go myself and now, after having beaten it, I certainly don't regret the purchase.\n\nI won't introduce the story since it's all on the description, it's what it's there for, but I will say it's a beautifully paced, narrative driven game with a strong emphasis on a rich story, which was certainly a very memorable one that I will remember for quite a while.\n\nThe gameplay is from a 3rd person perspective, which encourages stealth over open combat, the latter of which often proves fatal against multiple enemies. Sometimes the enemy A.I. can be a bit dense, and alerted enemies can forget about your existence entirely when you hide for a short time, but it's functional and solid, without being too difficult. The puzzle solving in the game adds some extra challenge and encourages you to utilise every item in your inventory at some point and makes use of a well designed companion system.\n\nGraphics are beautiful and it's clear a lot of attention and care went into designing the detail of each map and character, although I did see the odd clipping issue with corpses glitching through stairs occasionally. I also experienced a bit of graphical stuttering (running on an 11GB Nvidia Geforce GTX 1080TI on maximum settings) but this was few and far between, is certainly not a deal breaker and overall mostly got a solid and stable 60 FPS throughout. I would say I'm personally not a fan of the chromatic aberration effect around the view peripheral which a lot of games claims ""enhances"" the overall effects quality when it's actually just an imperfection in a lens system that undermines image quality; same goes for the lens dirt effect which I find more of a distraction than an enhancement and ideally I feel there should have been options to toggle them on or off in the graphics settings.\n\nThe musical score was brilliantly done and works in a way which enhances the atmosphere without drowning out the ambience, as oppose to just being there for the sake of it and can often break the immersion in many games.\n\nThe game itself is quite linear and sets you along a path rather than the often overused open world genre, but this is what keeps the game's pacing going and certainly doesn't make it a boring experience, it's very much the opposite since the story will keep you hooked and wondering what happens next. This brings me to my next point which is replay value, which I've noticed a number of reviews say the game is a bit lacking in, mentioning once the game is done, it's not the same when playing it again. I would say the same could be said of any game and suggesting a game lacks replay value is akin to suggesting an excellent movie or book can't be enjoyed a second time. Granted, you never get the same surprise as with the first playthrough but it all comes down to what you feel ""replay value"" is, to me it's merely whether or not I want to play a game again on account of it being good.\n\nNone of the excessive DLC, live service and microtransaction B.S. trying to hoodwink you into parting with your money which you get with most AAA games these days, this is merely a quality game made well with a lot of love and care and if anything, this game should serve as inspiration to other studios wanting to grab the attention of an audience.\n\nTo conclude, this game tells a fantastic, rich and memorable story which I'd be happy to experience again. The gameplay mechanics are solid and entertaining, the horror element gives you a feeling of genuine dread, given the vulnerability of the protagonists and is simply an overall brilliant effort from a studio who clearly cared a lot about the game, the story and how it was delivered to the player. This deserves the praise and recognition its been getting and I just hope more people spot this and give it the recognition it truly deserves, because it really deserves to do well and be successful, the developers really have achieved something pretty wonderful with this. Definatly worth it if you enjoy games with a strong emphasis on story and narrative.\n\nOne thing I will mention as a side note is, being a Star Wars fan, is it just me that felt one of the game's main antagonists reminded me a lot of Kylo Ren? That was before he threw a little tantrum and broke his mask, which I thought was a shame, that was an awesome mask!\n\nReview update: They have since released an update which addresses the chromatic aberration effect by adding an option to reduce it. It doesn't eliminate it completely but it's now hardly noticeable.",Recommended

"I don't think people who call the gameplay bad or nonexistent have actually ever played a game with trash gameplay.\n\nGraphics, level design, story and characters are all amazing. I did not expect it to be this good.",Recommended
"The story side of the game seems really well thought out, the environment is beautiful and rich with color and depth. The characters and their voice acting are all good my only gripe is that you don't spend much time with anyone but the sister and brother. The gameplay is my only issue, it is very slow and suffers from really bad ai. From the start I knew that it was going to be just another slog messing around with the ai and figuring out what I could get away with. \n\nIf story ranks higher than gameplay for you then this could be an easy pick up for you, however if you prefer gameplay then I would recommend sitting this one out or watching a lets play.",Recommended
"I highly enjoyed playing through this game, and i plan on playing it again to attain 100% completion of it.\nThe story is good, and the world building is done well i love the atmosphere it gives off.\nThe stealth mechanics leave a little to be desired. The combat is done well for a story driven Casual game.\nThere was one point in the game where i managed to softlock myself but i was able to restart the chapter and continue from there. \nOverall it is a fun game and gives you a beautiful world to explore.\n\nPlus putting the flowers in your hair is the best i love it thank you for making that a thing Asobo Studios",Recommended

"A Plague Tale: Innocence was a fantastic game that gives you around a week of playtime if you only play for an hour or two a day. It was so good I had to just keep playing for 3-4 hours at a time. The music is super cool, and a lot of times it instills extreme fear into you because of the grotesqeu imagery of the game. You have the option to sneak AND murder your enemies which gives more freedom to your play style. I think that this game should have been a movie because of the quality of the surroundings and sound track, it's hard to encorperate a super cool combat system into games like this but I think they did a great job! Sometimes the combat in particular scenes feels... droopy? it's not fun because they just send things at you slowly to give you time to react. Although some scenes gave me trouble and I had to redo them 5 or 6 times! I wish there was an (easy medium hard) setting in the game that gave you less time to react for the HARDENED GAMER. and an easy mode where you don't die all the time creating awkward scenes such as when the blacksmiths son is pushing the cart, and you need to defend you, hugo, and him. And you die. over and over. And it's supposed to be this super intense sacrafice that the guy is making and you're supposed to be really upset but that scene has too many guards that come at you in rapid succesion which kinda killed the moment for me. the music in that scene was phenominal as well. \n\nI reccomend buying it, I wouldn't care if the price was 60 dollars it was super fun! Buy it! you will cry! And be angry! \n\nImagine living in the era where the plague is running rampant, that's fucking nuts. And the Inquisition is horrifying how they treat the people. you see a lot of bad things humans shouldn't see ever, and it kinda gives you a window into the past as far as imagining how that would go, and they sent us the message that went VERY VERY WELL. It's scary, it's real, and it's intense.\n\n\nBUY THIS GAME",Recommended

"Honestly one of the best games I've played in a long time. The graphics are great, the rats are very impressive, the world and story is interesting and immersive, and the gameplay is fun and a little challenging at times, while staying simple enough that you shouldn't get stuck or frustrated, though that isn't what the game is all about. The main draw and drive is the story and adventure that the characters endure.\n\n",Recommended
Amazing game. Normally i'm very picky but this game was truly immersive with an engaging story. 10/10,Recommended
"One of the best story-driven games I've played so far. Such a great atmosphere as well. Funny how I only found out about it a month before release, this thing came out of no where and it's so damn good.",Recommended

"Beautiful, engaging, immersive and emotional. Superb storydriven game.",Recommended
The story of this game is very good. I was hooked right from the beginning. The only thing i can think of that needs improvement is the optimization. I tested every setting and resolution and still experienced frame drops in the most random of times. Smooth one minute and then some slight frame reduction then its goes down and comes right back up. The game has only just been released and still sits at version 1.0...so my hopes are high. Buy this game. the story and clever game play is worth it.,Recommended
"so i usually never do reviews but i just have to for this game,\n\nso first of all the graphics are just insane. Usually games like this are either to colorfull or dont have any color at all. Well this game has both. It can make the most beautifull landscape with trees flowers and just everything but also the darkest city or dungeon u can imagine. Second the story. So im not very far in the story yet but i can say that it will be awesome. \nIt has the right amount of everything tbh.  So far it was heartbreaking but also heartwarming at the same time. Just incredible in short. I dont want to talk to much anyway. Just try this game for yourself im sure u wont regret it :)\n\n",Recommended
"It's linear, it's short, no zap guns, no superpowers, and it's one of the best games I've played this year. Kudos to all involved in making A Plague Tale: Innocence.  Great story-driven game that relies on thinking and sneaking past dangers.  Totally enjoyed it.",Recommended
"I really wanted to like this game, but it's way too difficult, and the controls are clunky. There's glitches in cut-scenes were the character's eyelashes float outside their eyes (obviously a 3D model issue which wasn't addressed) so as it is, I cannot recommend it.",Not Recommended
"Great game so far! Im about 7-8 hours in and I cant stop playing. The story line will keep you hooked. There are many trial and error tasks, but nothing that cant be figured out. I bought this game because of the great reviews and I am not disappointed, definitely worth the investment! Ive read about some bug issues but so far I havent experienced any.",Recommended
"I must warn you that i don;t make alot of reviews and everything I say here is everything that i personally likes, loved, disliked, and hated about the game. I am only here to give my opinion to help you.\n\nSo i was very sceptical about this purchase because of the price tag and the knowledge that it only lasts on an average of 8 hours, so when i started I started the game with bad intentions, with a fear that i might not like it and was ready to refund it before I've even started. But i must say this game really broke down my walls and at the end i had a thirst FOR MORE! \nI am so happy that i brought it, and I've got a feeling that i will be replaying it. The characters are very likeable and well acted, the setting and the pure beauty of this game is truly stunning, and inspiring, and the story while it has its plot holes and at first seeming on the edge or ridiculous, it turned out to be rich with plot and love that just drags you with it to continue the journey. Its really is something I look for in a Story based game. That and the additional interactions, collectables, crafting and little side stories that reward you for searching makes this a Brilliant game.\n\nNow while this game is brilliant it isn't the ""Last of us"" that some people say it is, at least personally i didn't find it that way.\nIt did seem rushed at the start, i felt there could be more to the starting plot before the (excuse my french) ((Pun Intended)) S*** hits the fan. but that is again a personal opinion, some people might wanna get into the game and not mess about in a story building and tutorial section of a game and i understand that.\nThe game also has some bugs and mishaps. some worse some better but I've had some glitchy characters and enemies, one time I've almost got stuck in some... stuff. sorry no spoilers and a crash. In other cases i had issues with the game itself not liking what im doing and not allowing me to do thing i want to do, it seemed in some cases that if you happened to accidentally wonder through a door or start something you cant go back for a second to collect some rocks or something and in other cases you cant do things in a way that you shouldn't because the game will bug out. But its nothing that kept me up at night, and it wasn't hard to get immersed back into the game.\n\nOverall I can only recommend the game and hope this review was helpful to you!\nNow go and have a good time in medieval France!... or don't, your choice :)",Recommended

"This game is quite unique, for obvious reasons if you grab it an play it. You'll know. The story is also interesting enough and the truly beautiful thing about it is, the children voicing the characters really sells the game and what is going on in the moment they express their feelings. There moments in the game that have some kind of tension and trough the voice of the little kid you can feel the emotions quite Recommended his voice. That also happen with the female playing his sister, she is actually good as well.\n\nTruly an interesting story and characters portrait here.",Recommended
"Wonderful landscapes and sceneries, interesting and not worn out story, great gameplay mechanics, no bugs so far, wonderful soundtrack, nearly perfect voice acting. And when did you ever play a girl with her little brother in an rpg? In times of battle royale-madness everywhere and games focussing on multiplayer stuff and just excluding story and solo-stuff, there is a great need of developers making excellent games like this. This one has no open world and isn't 150 hours long, it's absolutely linear and relatively short. And i'm in love with EVERY minute of it!!! Buy it and support those developers, it's very well earned!",Recommended

"I am about halfway done with this game soo far.  I am enjoying the dark, messed up story.  This game pulls no punches with brutality, at one point my little brother lagged behind and a guard stuck a pike thru his chest.  It's a story about two children who are forced to grow up way too fast who lived a sheltered lifestyle in a nice house with servants.   The puzzles are OK, but not terribly bad to figure out, but sometimes you WILL get stuck at a point of the game for a while and it gets frustrating.\n     I also wish that the rats played a smaller part of the game, i literally just played for 2 hours and it was nothing but rat avoidance.  It kind of took away from my immersion when there are constantly 1000+ rats everywhere for hours and all you are doing is trying to figure out how to avoid them.  Another thing that bugs me is at many points in time you are able to carry a torch, but leave it behind for dumb reasons.  I would highly recommend to anyone to play, just make sure you turn off the HUD and play in a nice quiet room to get fully immersed in the story, which is both well written, as well as well voice acted out.\n     Some people finish this game in 10 to 12 hours, but i have a feeling that they just rush from point A to point B without appreciating the beautiful surrounding that the game devs made for them.  Oh, and I also wish they had more crafting mats because every time i go to a place to try to upgrade i am always short something even tho i pick everything i see up until my inventory is full.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED GAME.",Recommended
I rarely write reviews on anything but I felt I had to write a review for this fantastic game. After endless massive open world action games it is SO refreshing to play a linear story driven game! \n\n- The game play and mechanics are fantastic\n- The characters and voice acting are top notch\n- The story is very compelling \n- The sound design is perfect as is the soundtrack\n- The graphics are amazing (special mention to the lighting)\n- The controls feel responsive and tight\n\nTo summarise: BUY. THIS. GAME.,Recommended
8 to 10 hour mostly linear experience and there is nothing wrong with that.\n\nYou can choose between stealth and if you´re like me you say f' it and just kill everyone in your way :-D\n\n,Recommended
"This is a special game. Very unlike any single game I've played. It has mechanics and methods I've seen in various games like Bioshock: Infinite and The Walking Dead Style of Telltale games. It's a great narrative, character driven stealth game. It tells the story of Amecia and her family, especially her little brother Hugo. Obviously taking place in a time of plague. I've also never played a game this brutal before. It deals in child death and even more gruesome situations. The character building and relationships is done quite well. There's a lot of cooperative play with your companions. Although it's a brutal game it's also a very heartwarming tale.\n\nThe graphics are amazing, some of the best I've seen, visuals are freaking awesome. The audio is also on point and very thematic. The weakest part is the game play. It can be a bit repetitive with auto aim combat and puzzle solving. But, the progression of the story will keep you on your toes. I place this game with Bioshock: Infinite. And as indie studio that is a major feat.\n\nOne major flaw is the initial price tag of $44.99. For a 15 hour game I feel they would actually make more money at 24.99 by the amount of game sales. Still, if your wallet isn't hurting it's worth the entertainment. I am really looking forward to what this studio brings in the future.",Recommended
"It's an ok game. Is worth is price without excelling in anything. I didn't have too high expectations when I started playing and after a few hours I didn't feel disappointed at all; while I wouldn't call it a must, nor a masterpiece, it has some pleasant surprises that will make it worth your while, on sale is probably going to be a really good catch ;)",Recommended

"I was hyped for a long time, this was the first game I ever pre-ordered, I payed quite a bit for this game... and I haven't been let down one bit! Amazing graphics and surprisingly well optimized (playable on ultra and 60fps on high on a gtx 980m), which was my biggest worry. The story is pretty exciting and the character development is simply stunning! The gameplay is fun, but I feel the story and atmosphere are clearly the focus of this game (which I think is the right choice for this game). It's not always the easiest game, but I haven't had to pull up any guides because I was stuck, so definitely playable for more casual gamers as well! (I haven't finished the game yet, so that could still change, of course)\nIt most certainly is a buy for me! You won't regret it!",Recommended
"A Plague Tale: Innocence is a story driven-linear game which gives it short playtime but deeper story.\nAmicia and her little brother Hugo are 15 year old girl and 5 year old little boy, witnessed so many people dying and tragedy amongst them. Hence it makes sense that they are getting stronger while story goes. And trust me, Hugo is not a burden. Their touching relationship and attitude made me love both siblings.\n\nI like it has less combats, more stealth and puzzles.\nThey are running away and protagonist Amicia is just 15 years old so It would've been strange if the game was focused on combat.\nPuzzles are not that hard to solve. Meaning that it doesn't break the pace of progress.\n\nUpgrading & crafting add a bit of fun for gameplay wise.\nHave to use different kinds of crafted rocks (fire, water etc) for appropriate situations. And upgrading gears makes things easier.\nOf course, upgrading & crafting require some loot items.\n\nEverything about sound is perfect.\nSoundtrack kicks, voice acting is wonderful and sound effects are just awesome.\nI love how voice acting done for this game especially. Amicia and Hugo's voices are done by real young actors. They did great job. (Other actors did great job too for sure)\n\nGraphics are not bad but too blurry. Makes textures look low res. It needs some sort of proper blur on/off option.\nThe atmosphere and environment is beautiful but in terms of character, it needs some work. The facial expression seems not even exist. Well, facial expression does exists for cutscenes but it doesn't seem to appear in-game (or very little, perhaps). And their eyes look weird in-game too, doesn't even look like focusing on something.\n\nLack of replay value is a bit let down.\nNo NG+ or no other game modes. So what i did was, i played my first playthrough with English voice and second playthrough with French voice with different color of clothing. And tried to do all achievements. Total 16hrs for me.\n\nA Plague Tale: Innocence is a GOTY kind of thing in my opinion.\nSome may think playtime is short (around 10 hrs) but still there are way more pros than cons.\nThus, i highly recommend unless you're afraid of rats.\nCheers to Asobo Studio and Focus Home Interactive for making such a beautiful game.\n(We need a sequel!)",Recommended

"If you like games in which there is exactly and only one way to progress, and combat sequences that are basically glorified cutscenes that require you to do a specific thing in a specific order or else you'll be restarting from a checkpoint and re-running the same exact scripted sequences countless times, then this is the game for you.",Recommended
"Overall a pretty nice package of a game.  Good story, solid audio work and music, great voice acting and excellent graphics.  As long as you're okay with unrealistic ""alchemy"" solutions to problems that are akin to magic you'll be okay with the level of realism in this fantasy story.  Basically you maneuver your way through or around rats and or guards to progress through the story.  I would have almost preferred some kind of cooldown system compared to the crafting system they used instead, but it definitely works in this game.  All of the levels happen to be riddled with all of the crafting materials you'll need to progress (lucky you) which is why I almost would have preferred a cooldown system verses this crafting one but that's more of a nitpick than a flaw.  The game is totally linear (on rails) and you can't stray from the intended path for long until you run into a ridge you cant climb, invisible wall etc.  However the environment design is done well enough I didn't feel too much like a rat in a cage.\n\nThis game has plenty of stealth opportunities to it but the AI is incredibly idiotic.  For example I lobbed a rock at a guard's head then hid for about 15 seconds and he shrugs then returns to his patrol.  Also, you'd swear the guards were half deaf and legally blind.  Their cone of vision lets you slip past them quite easily, but hey this ain't splinter cell.  \n\nYou'll be dragging your little brother around by the hand for a fair portion of the game, or otherwise accompanied by at least one other person but don't worry, if they're sticking out from cover a bit the guards will just assume its another greyish blob and move on.  As you obtain more upgrades you can take a more direct approach to combat situations if that's more your thing.  There's nothing in this game (like a puzzle) that will stump you.  Most obstacles you'll figure out how to maneuver through as soon as glancing at them.\n\nGame took about 10.8 hours to complete and I definitely took my time.  If you're on the fence about this game I would suggest you wait for a sale, (or buy it for cheaper on GreenManGaming like I did) as it's one of those games with diminished replay value after your first time around.\n\n",Recommended

Just buy this game.\nIt managed to tell a solid story without breaking self-established lore rules within 10 hours.\nGame of Thrones season 8 made more mess with it's story in less time.\n,Recommended
"That's exactly the example when developers understand what they can do in game and they do it on 100%. Such a rare story-driven product.\nThere is no many paths to go through a level but every level is a puzzle which you can solve with tools you have even you have only a couple. The bosses here are a kind of puzzles too. \nThere is no necessary to risk but if you choose the hard way with many enemies you'll always be reward with rare resources.\nThere is no many gameplay mechanics but the game juggles them often, so you never have time to start tired of them. And when you start to think that you knew all tricks 'A plague tale: Innocence' changes the rules completely.\nThe plot is drawn through dialogues and it isn't complicated but consistent and with not deep but sufficient lore input.\nThe game leads you always with commentarios from characters. And even if you stuck somehow they will help you find a solution.\nThe rest of the pluses are absolutely stunning graphic, lighting and sound (effects, soundtrack, voiceover are all in).\nTo be honest this game is not fully polished and there are a few small bugs. But for me this game worthed its price in the first five minutes in that amazing forest. And after 10 hours it began to worth it twice.",Recommended
"It worth a best narrative award, and a nomination of the best game of this year. It is really appreciated that someone still making great linear story game.",Recommended
"Personal Pros:\n- Cutest kid in video games ever.\n- None of the followers feel like they're a burden.\n- Genuinely engaging story and world.\n- Awesome character development in the beginning.\n- Visuals that will take your breath away.\n- Cool nod to history buffs while also adding a healthy dose of fantasy to spice up the Black Plague.\n- Constant checkpoints to make your failures not so drastic. \n\nPersonal Cons:\n- Lip sync and voice acting can be lacking.\n- Feels disingenuous to story when you stray from the path searching for crafting materials.\n- Crafting system can leave you uncertain as to what you should prioritize upgrading.\n- Some puzzles and dangers feel very hand-holdy, and the solution is obvious. \n- Guard patrol patterns can be INSANELY generic.\n- Character drama feels a bit rushed towards the end.\n\nI give this game a solid 8-9/10. I really love it. I can see why some people don't. If you like games for story, especially catering towards a more historical fantasy or standard fantasy setting, buy this game IMMEDIATELY.\n\nTL;DR Summary [Possible Spoilers]:\n- There will never be a child more adorable than Hugo.\n- Amicia is best girl for all the right reasons.\n- Melie is best girl for all the typical reasons.\n- Rodric is the spirit animal of everyone who is tired of these damn stealth sections.\n- Arthur doesn't hang around long enough to matter.\n- Lucas is a huge nerd but so is everyone so really he's alright.\n- Rats are terrifying. Intelligent rats are my actual nightmare.\n- The Inquisition in this game is what every other fictional 'Inquisition' is trying to be.\n- When in doubt, solve all your problems with well-timed bombs and acid to the face.",Recommended
"I LOVED this game. Lovable characters, fantastic voice acting, an engaging story, and BEAUTIFUL graphics. \n\nNow i say loved because of one reason: The final boss. I have never seen a game destroy it's entire set of mechanics and create such a stupid gimmick like this game did with the final boss. It was frustrating, repetitive, and painful all around.\n\nI recommend everyone play this game, but stop before the final boss and watch the ending on youtube or something.",Recommended
"I really enjoyed playing this game, I really loved the characters they touched my heart. I wish if was there an Arabic subtitle. Recommended!!",Recommended
"Overall, the story of the game is interesting and good. But I cannot recommend the game for its gameplay and some aspects that made you disconnect from the story. At last, I kind of question a very specific mechanic that was given to us the players and I'll explain just down here.\n\nEvery time you'd start a new chapter (Or almost) you are suggested at the very beginning to hold X to skip the chapter. I question: Why ? Why would we skip the core element that makes the game decent ?\n\n\nAs for the gameplay category..\n\nThe game clearly doesn't sell itself for the gameplay and its mechanics it's mediocre and can be quite frustrating considering the one shot penalty if you mess up. The puzzle elements weren't the most savant ones but that in itself is okay because the game isn't about solving puzzles, but following a story. But we can at least compliment the effort of a small but present upgrade system.\n\n\nThe story\n\nIt ain't the most glorious, I'm probably beyond the targeted age the story wants to. It's basically a bunch of kids going against an empire (In this case the english) somehow capable of defeating trained soldiers who's got twice or thrice their age and discover that there's something ancient related to the plague that infest their lands.\n\nAnd somehow the main character manages to deal with all that with the help of a sling and an alchemy boy, I mean..  DUH of course.\n\n\nThe voice Acting\n\n\nNow if there's one thing I can at least give my love to, is the voice acting. It was magnificent ! I had the audio in english and I am french. But the actors did a fucking great job to get the french accent out of the french characters through the english vocals. It was splendid.\n\n\n\n5/10\n\nConsidering the price, I cannot recommend it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",Not Recommended

The acting was amazing the crew picked up really good voice actors. I love the fact you can use rats as an advantage to eat people alive, Everything about this is I rate and recommend 100%. But the only part I didn't like about this game was a dog's death as he gets sucked into a little hole as the rats devour him. I have 5 dogs and I'm one of those dog lovers who hate to see anything happen to them. But sometimes you gotta accept what the story line gives you even when it comes to a death of a dog.

"Great immersive story heavy game that uses all the available tools to deliver a great linear story adventure.\n\nI'd place this game into the same genre as games like Life is Strange or the Telltale games as it's single most important feature is the telling of a story and it's characters. However instead of only watching tons of cutscenes and occasionally choosing some meaningless dialogue options that fake story interaction ""A plague tale"" uses actual gameplay mechanics to let you experience the story through the shoes of it's protagonist.\n \nThe stealth mechanics are simple yet effective and put this game far above walking simulator games or games that take away your control and prefer to show you quick time events. \n\nThis is one of those games that have to be experienced and not just watched so I recommend it to everyone who's into story focused games... just make sure you're into dark and creepy atmosphere because ""a plague tale"" so far is the best representation of a plague infested gaming world where you have to walk through mountains of corpses while rats feed on everything that is flesh... at least compared to games that I played.\n\nAlso kudos to the devs for using light and the interaction with the rat hordes in this unique way!\nIt really makes the development and conclusion of the story something special after feeling those glowing eyes waiting for their turn to feed on you throughout the entire game.\n\nThe only downsight of this game is probably the length that is to be expected with games that completely pass on meaningless side content.",Recommended
"This game isn't perfect, but it gets pretty damn close to it. The story is unique, the graphics are gorgeous and each place you visit is amazing. The characters are well fleshed and quite likable. The whole game is packed with feels ranging from disgust and sorrow to happiness and serenity.\n\nMy only complain here is that the combat was a bit clunky but you don't have to do a lot of it anyway. Most of the time you'll spend sneaking around.\n\nIt is a bit pricey (writing this at launch), but I believe this is very strong contender for game of the year.",Recommended
To be honest at the point i saw the trailer i expected some game with nice graphics and a good story but was a little bit worried that it gets boring after some time and isn't worth the bucks. Gladly i was wrong.\n\nThe gameplay is versatile and the story is harsh and thrilling and at this game i had this feeling where you really get pulled in and just enjoy the expirience. I can recommend that game to everyone who do care about an amazing story and they will not shy away when things get worse. \n\nAll in all a sweet surprise and it was worth the time.,Recommended

"Absolutely amazing. This is a Recommended game.\n\nNearly everything in this game is perfect. The visuals, including the lighting, are mind blowing. The audio is absolutely top notch. The voice acting is so good I never once got taken out of the immersion. The music fits every part of the game. The emotional scenes, and there are quite a lot of them, really pull on your heart strings.\n\nThat being said, and as others have mentioned, this is a story driven game, with an emphasis on stealth, puzzles to figure out, and the occasional combat which really is just some rocks and a slingshot. It feels like it fits though, the character is not a hero, or a badass. She's a young girl that's been traumatized, and is trying everything to keep her brother alive and safe.\n\nSeriously, this is the type of game that we've all been wanting for years. Actual subsistence, actual story, beautifully made and not some rushed garbage that a company pumped out to make some quick cash. Support developers like this, or we'll be stuck with nothing but Call of Duty and Battlefield games forever.",Recommended
"Amazing thats it, this game is about 10 plus hrs long, worth every penny!!! Highly recommend this game, to all who love narrative driven games! Beautifully done, graphics are on point, it feels Legit 1300's! Just get it thats it!",Recommended
"This game has the best story since Witcher 3. It's so easy to get attached to the characters (especially Hugo!) and genuinely care about what happens to them. I found myself laughing, near tears, and afraid alongside the characters. It is beautifully written and incredibly compelling, plus we get to explore a period you don't often see portrayed even though it's so well known (everyone knows about the black plague, but you don't usually see it visualized). The choices each child makes are incredibly realistic, meaning I'd completely believe that each child would ask those questions or say things the way they do given their various ages and experiences. The music is also breathtaking. While not incredibly unique, it does have a distinct tone and emotion that suits the game to perfection. \n\nTech specs:\nRTX 2080\nRyzen 5 2600\n16GBs 3200MHz ram\ninstalled on a Samsung 970 EVO 500Gb M.2 drive\nWindows 10 Insiders Preview prerelease\n\nThe game played at anywhere from 45-60 FPS on 4K Ultra settings with draw distance on high, anti-aliasing on low, and depth of field on low (personal preference). I did, however, experience frequent micro stutters in the initial chapters but went away as I progressed through the story. After following some tutorials regarding Nvidia vsync and power vs performance settings, the micro stuttering has lessened but is still present. I am, however, hesitant to blame the game for this as I am using a beta version of Windows 10 and Windows bugs have caused this sort of problem in the past. \n\nI don't mind a generally linear game if it uses that focus to tell a fantastic story in a fun way, and this one does just that. It doesn't have many pure invisible walls, and instead uses rats, guards, fences, and actual building walls which I appreciate. This all makes sense given that you're usually running through claustrophobic and tightly packed french towns, or crawling through crypts and ruined castles. In those scenarios, you'd expect to find blocked paths. The puzzles did stump me a few times in the later chapters when you are required to figure out a sequence of actions or attacks instead of focusing on a single ability, but I was never stuck for long. Alchemy ingredients are plentiful so you can waste some ammo without worrying too much but crafting ingredients like leather and fabric (some of which are required to make the more high-powered alchemy abilities) are much rarer. This sometimes meant I had to weigh an alchemy creation against an equipment upgrade and more than once I wasted a bunch of the more common ammo to avoid having to make a big one. To be clear, you don't have to play that way; I just grew up on games where resource management was essential, and it's given me a need to horde rarer materials.\n\nOverall I give this game a 9.5 or even a 10. I was never bored or uninterested with the story, and the gameplay always left me satisfied. If you like a good story or want to try something relatively short, you won't regret picking this game up.",Recommended

Solid 9 out of 10.\nBut I am still going to thumb down/no for this game just cuz of the amount of hours you need to finish I't all. I spent 11 hours In this game and that was the end for me. In my opinion this is NOT a game that you go back to and play again. Sadly there Isent enough gameplay for that, neather content. There Is nothing makeing me crave to come back to a game with onely an amazing story. For sure its absolutly wanted to play and get through this amazing story. Tho for 44,99 euro, 11 hours is not worth it for onely a great story. Big no! A game with approximately 11 hours Is onely worth, In my opinion about 10 - 20 euro, and now Im tipping when im saying 20 euro. If this game was about 50 - 60 hours long I would agree with the price thats there right now. I honestly would say, do play this game, but wait untill its cheaper.\n\nIf you want to sell a game thats onely good story, nothing else and its onely 11 hours and full priced i think thats a BIG rip-off\n\nThanks for the game devs! Next time i wont alow the rip-off tho happen.

"With the best will in the world - this game is not good. \n\nYes, it's beautifully drawn in places, and yes, there's a touching and pretty well acted relationship between the two protagonists.\n\nHowever, there's serious issues. Despite what you've heard, rat physics are not good - just a particle effect that collapses if you scrutinise it for more than a second. Why is that an issue? Well, it means they aren't scary. \n\nAnd given that they aren't scary, there's nothing left to enjoy, because there's no gameplay. Just endless, simple, single solution progress areas that barely contain any so called 'puzzles.'\n\nThere's no challenges to get your teeth into. Every problem has a single, telegraphed solution. It's so dull. Were it not for the graphic content, this is essentially a game for small children, in pure gameplay terms. \n\nOh and that story - it's full of supernatural nonsense that quickly undermines the tense, murky tension of the period that is established earlier on. \n\nI'm not kicking the developer, I'm just upset I paid £30 for this none-game, and given the lack of gameplay - I wouldn't even buy it on sale. I don't normally write reviews, but I feel compelled to help at least one person save their hard earned money if they read this given the sudden attention (mysteriously positive) this game received upon release. \n\nIt's just so frustrating because all the elements were there for a cracking, head scratching, very scary stealth action puzzle game. \n\nBut it is not that.",Not Recommended

"Well I just completed A Plague Tale: Innocence a game created by a new Asobo Studio a company that I never heard of til now, looking at their previous games this game is a massive milestone for the company, due to it being something completely different and easily triple A quality in my opinion. \nThe game is set in a time not really explored within any game that I know of, during the time of the hundred years war, a war between both England and France and the black plague both two big events within history. The game really imagines these events in full detail and accuracy and at the same time putting on their own twist of fantasy, making it their own unique world and story, which for me was a hugely immersive and visceral experience.\n\nPros:\n\nGraphically this game looks stunning, the lighting the amount of detail and textures are like a piece of art at times. It brought me back to the times of playing Witcher 3 were I was fully pulled into the world because the amount of love the developers put into the game was prominent in everything you saw.\n\nThe story itself is fantastic, full of interesting characters and development to them helping you to care for them and their journey throughout. I really felt the story started with a quite simple idea and plot and then slowly evolved over time into something more unique and complex but still sticking to a method to keep the story easy to follow.\n\nThe music is amazing in this game, each piece is used in ways of evoking emotion at points within the game, were it things like fear, love, calmness and even the action within the game play. The music really adds to the entire experience of the game never overstepping its use and harmonizing well with every aspect.\n\nThe combat was something that really caught me off guard, at the initial viewing of the game, I felt it was going to be mainly stealth and perhaps running away, but the game is far more then just stealth. This is a key aspect of the combat at times but other times its more of an open combat. You use a sling as your primary weapon, something quite personal to the character and very unique in terms of a video game. Overtime you create special items to overcome obstacles and with this you have the ability to combat situations in different ways, giving more variety to combat.\n\nCons:\n\nStraight away one con personally for me, was a glitch I experienced within one of the chapters, it was really unfortunate as it broke the momentum of the game and actually forced me to replay an entire chapter, it was an actual soft lock for the game.\n\nConsidering the amount of hours it took me to complete the game, I feel the price could be a little lower, this is a minor issue because overall the game is fantastic but I also feel it is something that brings it down a little.\n\nI enjoyed the game so much I honestly cant find many faults with it, only other thing maybe a mode in which you are forced to not have auto-aim with your sling, making it more difficult.\n\nConclusion:\n\nOverall this game was fantastic and brought me to a world full of beauty and horror and fully immersed me into the story and the characters journey, it really wasn't what I was expecting and I'm glad because I truly experienced something unique and not afraid to delve into quite bizarre and interesting concepts.

For those that liked A Tale of Two Brothers and The Last of Us, I'm pretty sure you'll enjoy this game. The game should be set at 30 dollars MAX, The game isn't worth 45 dollars let alone 35. Still been enjoying it though, Glad I made the purchase for this game. MAKE SURE TO VERIFY GAME FILES SINCE IT WILL LEAVE A FULL GIG OUT FROM INSTALLING WHICH MAKES CHAPTER 12 CRASH EVERY TIME YOU START IT",Recommended
"A charming little game that is free from all the usual bullshit nowadays. No endless fetch quests to provide ""content"" or whatever, no loot, no grinding. \n\nI'm not going to tell you what it's about because you can see that yourself from the trailers. It is quite atmospheric and aesthetically pleasing with some cheesy (haha because rats, get it? My mom thinks I'm very funny!) dialogue here and there. If you want to just have a relaxing game you can spend a few hours on and laugh at french accents, I give it a solid recommendation.",Recommended
"Once in a while comes out a game so special you almost feel bad when you play it for long, you want to take the time savor it and that is exactly what I'm going to do.\nThe graphics are phenomenal, the characters acting and sounds are superb, the story is compelling, the game-play is immersive and in total this game has a tons of atmosphere.\nIt runs smooth like butter on my machine everything on ultra with occasionally a single micro-stutter here and there.\n\n10/10",Recommended
"Amazing game, great, engaging story (albeit a bit short). Great atmosphere and soundtrack and likable characters (i loved finding the ""flower moments"" between Amicia and Hugo.\n\nIf you are looking for a hardcore stealth game this is not it, the stealth is pretty easy and actually a lot of fun.\n\nThe only negative point for me was the final boss battle, which imo was way over the top, and i feel it didn't really fit the story, which up to that point was (at least somewhat) believable, a total WTF moment. All that build up and than a ridiculous ending like this.. but maybe i am the only one who feels that way??....\n\nOverall it was still worth the pre-order for me, and i really hope there is more to come....",Recommended
"This really is a remarkable game that went under the radar for a lot of people, myself included. The story, the characters and the single player game is very enjoyable and extremely rewarding. It really is worth checking out if you like a strong, character driven single player game which doesn't follow a lot of the traditional rules.",Recommended
"Before I opine on the nitty-gritty of this game, I think an important fact worth mentioning upfront is that this game was developed by around 45 people based in the city of Bordeaux, located at the southwestern region of France known for its wine. Hopefully it would be known for Asobo Studios soon too. \n\nOn to the review! \n\nI told myself I wanted to buy this game the first time I saw its gameplay, which was during E3 2018. Fast forward almost a year later, bought it and came away astoundingly impressed. Three points below justifying it.\n\n1) Story was captivating, exploring the interactions being the two siblings Amicia & Hugo as they escape from the protagonists with little to no weapon is rewarding. (Amicia is a teenager and Hugo is just a kid.) It elicits that on the edge of your seat feeling, cause you just don't know what's gonna happen next. So you're playing and playing itching to find out. Even though I've so far finished Chapter 1, I'm already sold. \n\n2) Gameplay was mainly stealth based, so more of using brains than muscles, cause you mainly use a slingshot while making the most of your environment to distract your enemies to prevent detection. Puzzles weren't overly difficult, so you won't need to crack your head figuring it out, a balanced mix I would say.\n\n3) This is where it really hits the spot for me, environment + sound. This game pulls you right in the moment you start playing. Oil painting inspired graphics and soundtrack composed specifically for this game takes the immersion to the next level where few developers are able to match. The developers truly done their homework and did their best to simulate medieval France in its dark ages, evident by its grim and hopeless ambience (and hoards of rats) plagued by deadly diseases. You'll just empathize the characters and feel bad for them while wishing for things to turn for the better, even if it's just a modicum of hope. To sum it up, this game is essentially a virtual time machine for me to explore France in its past with all the beauties and riches offered, a truly second to none experience.\n\nThese aspects already made it a very good game for me, almost perfect actually. But the developers went beyond that because they nailed a few things that other developers, even AAA ones failed, and these are all PC-specific. \n\n1) This game barely has any bugs or technical issues on PC, it's completely playable since day 1!! I know this shouldn't even be a praise cause it's a given that it should be shipped in a workable condition. But it's fair to say that many games nowadays have encountered FPS rate drops, weird glitches and bugs that ruin the experience or just downright crashing making it completely unplayable. So thank you developers for porting PC the right way!\n\n2) The controls feel extremely smooth and fluid, controllers are not required at all. I've come to appreciate this because I wanna enjoy PC games the native way, with the duo combination of keyboard and mouse instead of anything else. It's good that Steam supports controllers, but I'd much prefer the traditional PC way. \n\n3) No microtransactions that wanna milk maximum money out of you. So you get what you pay, a really well built game that leaves you wanting for more. Well priced at $45, but I just wish there would be DLCs, would definitely preorder for that. (Fingers crossed!)\n\nAll in all, this is $45 well spent, especially when all you wanna do is turn on your PC and enjoy a great time. This game is enthralling, exciting and gripping. Serves as a lodestar for other PC games to follow if you wanna have 93% of positive comments (it's 93% as of writing this comment). \n\nAsobo Studio, if ever you're reading this comment, thank you so much for what you're doing and pls continue doing it. All 45 of you are thriving and I can't wait to see what you all will have in store next. Be it a new game or upcoming DLCs, I'm down for it. \n\nAnyone that's browsing the comments contemplating whether to purchase, it's a resounding yes from me. Gonna be $45 you glad you spent.",Recommended
Was pretty good.,Recommended
"The game is fun. I did enjoy the game and while there are quite some frustrations in the game. I didn't mind them at all and the story kept me captivated to see more and more in the next chapters. Combat and stealth system is fun. It kind of mixes everything together and it's cool that the weapon isn't always easy to use which is why there are aim assist. Although, I would love to see more of what they can do with the game like a mini game or something. I would recommend to any of you who wants to try it out. Definitely play the game, it's not very long. I finished it around 15 hours. Though I do find the game's puzzle to be enjoyable and worth it despite me taking a long time to finally complete it.",Recommended

"Beat all my expectations, and I expected quite a lot given the reviews. The story is incredible, leaving you feeling very attached to its cast of characters. The price is a touch much for the amount of time it takes to beat the game, though in fairness I'm not a completionist. I enjoyed the story and didnt stray looking for achievments. \n\nAn honest 9/10 story with 8/10 gameplay which is simple yet effective.\n\nCouldnt recommend it more <3",Recommended
"Gameplay is fun, stealth system is working fine, rat swarms are cool. \n\nBut,\n\nThe game has some serious pacing issues, think Fahrenheit: Indigo Prophecy, they both started as a thrilling and intriguing experience, but at the last quarter of the story, it turns into one giant supernatural power battle. excuse me wtf?\n\nMany side characters aren't that developed, and are discarded in the most stupid way possible.\nTurning your back on the enemy, really? \n\nThe main characters are also not that likeable, the female protagonist is okay, however Hugo is pure pain to be with. He is simply an annoyance in the first few chapters, and proceeded to become a even bigger nuisance. I don't know about others, but I do love a more cooperative partner in game. [spoiler]I very much enjoy seeing Hugo gets eaten by rats [/spoiler]\n\nThe main villain is also retarded, he's the basically Albert Wesker Mk.2 with rats. And what's with that final boss battle, are we making oreos?",Recommended
"Pros : \n+ Beautiful environment \n+ Extraordinary ambience and atmosphere due to the settings, the light work and the sound work\n+ Very likable and well designed characters\n+ An interesting and compelling story\n+ Those damn rats\n+ Adds new ways of dealing with rats and ennemies until far into the game\n+ Full of small but refreshing gameplay and game design ideas\n+ I like the slinger, it's original\n\nCons : \n- May prove too short for some (10h)\n- Boss fights are not very great, even tend to be frustrating at times\n- A few gameplay imprecisions that may lead to frustrating game over \n\nNeutral : \n= Crafting system, not very necessary but doesn't hinder the game's pace (the game gives you what you absolutely need if you don't want to scavenge)\n= A few collectibles that have nice little descriptions, probably not interesting enough for me to play every chapters again \n= Puzzles are OK, I derped over one or two tho\n\nFor gamers :\n* who don't mind when story is far more important than gameplay \n* who don't decide if they like a game based on ""cost/hour"" \n* who like stealth and puzzles\n* who don't mind some ""die & retry"" up until they find the ""perfect way of doing it""\n* who like european medieval/middle ages ambience\n* who don't suffer from musophobia",Recommended

"9.6/10 from me.\n\nThis game, it's stunning in EVERY fricken' way people. Beautiful scenery, good story and story telling, unique and interesting characters, accurate depictions of the terror, mystery, and paranoia of those involved and affected by the Pandemic, a cool little fictional end to it with twists and turns to boot. The models are well made, and move and such pretty smoothly, the survival aspect is there, even when you think you have the game's crap down pat, you die. It's difficult and requires thought most of the time, giving you limited time to figure out most puzzles. The aspect of having a companion always at your side and can hinder you and your survival is actually pretty well done compared to others of the like. The story is captivating and interesting, throwing curveballs frequently. The ""villains"" are not really villains, but instead fighting for the same solution, just in a more controversial manner. The sheer effort and such put into making this game so amazing and the end product would normally make this an EASY 10/10 from me. Alas, some issues being early on, have arisen. Graphics popping out the butt, could very well be due to your computer itself, and I will be attempting to troubleshoot solutions common to games soon here. But one other major glitch (I say major due to it taking away from the beauty of the game along with potential investment into the story). The eyelashes and the ""glossyness"" or shine of every character's eyes/eyeballs come off and move around the immediate vicinity of their faces. Not a huge issue, just enough to detract from my personal experience.",Recommended
"I found myself really enjoying this title and the world it created!\n\nThe game itself is fairly simple. the stealth is extremely easy but it holds you in positions just long enough to feed you the story smoothly. the direction of the game i feel is very linear, there is room for exploration (which i love) so you can go about and look for collectibles and secrets without necessarily having to run everywhere. Honestly it feels as if you are on rails in a sense. but I'm 100% GOOD with that. The games strong suite is not in the game play but the story lovingly placed within. \nWITH THAT SAID...\n- The game play is not bad by any means. it's very good actually, if anything it's simple. (perfect for story telling)\n- If you happen to fail, the checkpoint/reload is almost instant which is always a good thing and doesn't disrupt the story. \n- I LOVE THE COMPANION SYSTEM. The friends you make along the way whilst taking this journey are VERY useful. They all have their own personalities and traits that truly make them memorable. \n- Combat and chases leave little room for failure but with the near instant checkpointing it works out well. \n- ALCHEMY! CURIOS, GIFTS and FLOWERS oh my! \nnormally i ain't a fan of hunting down the extra's but playing through this game i really enjoyed being a treasure goblin and searching around. I even learned quite a bit!\n - upgrade all teh things!\n\nPersonally i enjoyed this game so much i will be going back to perfect it but much like all good things however i was sad to see it end but i was happy to have experienced it. \nI highly recommend this game to anyone interested and i hope you enjoy the Journey as much as i have.",Recommended
"After so many disappointing AAA games in the past 12 months from every major studio it was refreshing to have something from an indie studio that is polished enough to fill that void. Asobo Studio really made a creepy, beautiful, atmospheric narrative adventure that deserves to win awards. It is definitely worth the cost of admission even though playtime is on the short-side compared to a AAA title. \n\nPros:\n  *  Graphically gorgeous and stunning\n  *  Strong narrative, tense/suspenseful pacing, and good story\n  *  Exemplar voice acting\n  *  Amazing Music (desperately needs an OST)\n \nCons: \n  *  Linear (with only a few places where you can explore off the beaten path)\n  *  Rather on the short side (12-15 hours)\n  *  Unoptimized (high CPU & GPU usage even in menus...common problem with Unreal Engine 4)\n  *  Occasional bugs after a couple of hours of gameplay (requiring you to restart game, reload last checkpoint, and try again).\n\nEven if you are well versed in other Stealth/Assassination games like Deus Ex or Assassin's Creed you will probably fail a Stealth Mission or two, or whiff an Assassination...but it's okay...other than having to try, try, try again you aren't penalized for failure. It is forgiving as a Casual game, yet satisfying enough for more seasoned Gamers. Just don't expect Dark Souls and expect more Telltale Games but with a far better story, pacing, graphics, voice acting, soundtrack, and mechanics.\n\n9/10 - Would bring plague rats down upon an Inquisition guard again",Recommended

Admittedly, I finished this game in about 8 hours. It is long as it needs to be and gave me quite a run for my money.\n\nIf story isn't your thing and combat is, I would ask you to take a step back. This isn't a combat game, or so much a stealth game, as it is a puzzle game with different aspects.\n\nIn all, I found no fault with the game, except for a bug which causes your character to jump back when at a ledge. Annoying, but not game-breaking. I'll be keeping an eye out for future games by this company.",Recommended
"8/10 apples\n(THIS REVIEW DOES NOT CONTAIN SPOILERS)\nIf you are looking for a story focused game that you get immersed in, then this game is for you. The game has its bright moments that make you feel hopeful, and its dark moments that leave you startled. Its a storybook with puzzels and minor horror.\nThe Good\n*Interesting story, it makes sense and there is never a moment where I disbelieve it\n*The gameplay pulls you in, playing as half story half game at most times, and you get to experience the growth between characters\n*Good use of music (Although slightly repetative towards the end, still sounds very good and unique tho :) )\n*Resources, it never feels like you are without choices but also you understand that you cant just use everything as you please, there are decisions to be made with your resources\n*Graphics, it looks very nice\n\nThe Bad\n*There are some visual bugs, but none that seriously affect the game as far as I could tell\n*Feels just shy of great, the game has many great features, but it feels like there just needed to be a bit more gameplay features\n*Little to no replay value\n*There needs to be a difficulty setting, let players pick if they want an easy story experience\n*I had some trouble with AI, bad guys running through things they shouldnt be able to and such\n*The ramp of difficutly, the whole game plays very nicely up until the end, then it goes from normal to not exactly hard, but annoying. The ramp unfournately ruined my immersion and really hurt the end story for me. This is not to say the story is bad at all. It is also very possible that I am not the world's greatest player.\n*There is also a question left unanswered at the end.\n\nThe goods are very good, and the bads are a bit of nitpicking\n\nOverall, if you have the money I suggest getting the game at its current price and supporting the creators, we need more games like this. If you are unsure, get it when it goes on sale eventually, you will not regret it!",Recommended

"First of all... the voice acting is really cool, then i searched in internet, and the voice was made by kids in around the age of the characters. \nthe story, soundtrack and graphics are really good. \nYou make empathy with the the characters, the first time Amicia kills someone is shocking, somehow you feel guilty.\nhowever after some chapters Amicia is fine killing people, and this goes kinda against the character arc. \nI recommend this game only if you like Narrative based videogames, the crafting, stealth and puzzles of the game are really really easy, but feels just enough to make you feel like your are doing something, this is good? \nin my opinion yes because the strong point of the game at the end is the story.",Recommended

"Honestly its games like this that made me love video games.\n\nThe people making this are a smaller group but damn they did well.\nThe game is simplistic, but well polished in the things it does and very few games have ever immersed me so well in the story.\n\nAside from a few cheesy boss fights the game is a great adventure story of a girl and her younger brother as they make their way through a world over-run by war, religious zealotry and war. Using a mix of stealth, alchemy and good old fashioned violence to forge their path.\n\nGood game for those who like fantasy-esque takes on history as well.",Recommended

Haha.\nI have been looking forward to this game for over 6 months and i my expectations were not disappointed at all.\n\nThe mix of medieval times, with a small twist of fantasy and such, blended incredible well.\n\nThe voice acting was very good - I liked the fact that the ""french"" voice acting were not done by native english speakers (Or at least it didn't sound like that) It added to the authenticity.\n\nMmmmh. The story is quite grim and the pacing of the game was nice, especially the beginning and middle section of the story were spot on.\n\nBut at the same time, the game was quite emotional and deep... If you really sit down and try to immersive your self, there are painful moments in the story.\n\nI can highly recommend this.... God.. I hope they make a sequel of some sorts.",Recommended
"It's honestly an interesting gorey experience. It has a lot of viscera throughout so keep that in mind if you're squeamish. I normally play gorey games and never seem to be bothered, but this one did on several occasions. The story isn't anything groundbreaking but they did a great job with how little they had to work with. It's a rat infestation of a plague, hard to make that fascinating. I bonded quickly with Hugo and Amicia and I think you will too. It's a solid buy for the price.",Recommended
"Now there's nothing inherently BAD about this game, there just isn't anything good about it either. It is a bland mix of boring mechanics and uninteresting characters, all themed around a meh plot with a bunch of themes that are hinted and unexplored. In the story it feels like every chapter was written by someone else, with something possibly interesting to explore, only to be ignored for the remainder of the game. The gameplay mechanics work, but they are just....meh. And yes there is crafting.\nFull review: https://youtu.be/yMAq2HbNgfc",Not Recommended

Not all puzzle obstacles need a genius to solve them, especially when the story is this captivating.\n\nAgain, a great game, full of emotion, a prime example of ""show don't tell"" and one where for once you get to see a perspective of a child in this cruel world that carries weight with each action you do.",Recommended

It might be shorter then today 'standards' for game length  but imo it worth every coin with the amazing storytelling, voice acting, plot leading and concept. \nIt fully enchanted me, pulled me into its world and story and even if it had some minor bugs (guards noticed me through walls, got stuck on impossible spot and didnt reset for me to retry.. etc).\nIf I could compare it to something maybe a ""Telltale /but better/ Hellblade edition game"". \nStory driven with amazing graphics and partial puzzling partial sneaking gameplay. I additionally loved the creative idea on the hero main weapon of choice. It was unexcepted, new and by it interesting and fun.\n\nIt is though not without issues. \nSome sneaking was frustrating and downward annoying but the variety I got as I progressed the game a bit balanced for me this aspect. I not quite like some control concept, it could have been done better.  \n\nBut overall this is how I can imagine a good story driven singleplayer game. The options with various NPCs I could use their various abilities for my advantage was a nice addition. Made the gameplay part refreshing and not feeling repetitive. I liked the character's personality they were all well written ones, I could feel them in the situation they were thrown into. \n\nI really only can recommend this game. A pure gem.",Recommended

"This is one of the most amazing games of 2019, which blows my mind because this game came out of nowhere. Do you want a game that has a compelling story with absolutely zero distractions? Buy this game. Do you want a gorgeous world that grips you with its detail and environment? Buy this game. Do you want meaningful characters and emotional moments? BUY THIS GAME.\n\n A Plague Tale: Innocence reminds me of what games used to be like before mircro-transactions and DLC. It's meant to be an experience that everyone can enjoy to the fullest. Gameplay and progression are smooth as well. I always felt that new mechanics and items were being introduced just as I had gotten used to the previous gameplay loop, making the game always feel fresh and keeping me on my toes. \n\nThe two crowning achievements in this game is surely the characters and the world. It's been a long time since I've seen characters act so realistically, where idle conversation not only serves as exposition, but also makes the characters feel like they're actually trying to be friends, even when the world is in chaos. They cry, joke, laugh, shout, and even get annoyed with each other. It really feels natural. The world is also extremely interesting. 1300's France during an unimaginable plague reminds me a lot of Dishonored's world mixed with Vampyr's world, except A Plague Tale outshines both of those worlds entirely (And I really love the Dishonored franchise). Villages and cities are packed with death and disease. Horrors in the form of rats and humans terrorize our protagonist but she must keep moving forward despite the trauma. No environment in 2019 has captured my attention more than A Plague Tale: Innocence.\n\nMy only complaint from the game is that a certain boss fight (Not gonna mention it specifically in this review) was difficult to understand how to beat and required me to die many times over just to figure out what to do. \n\nOverall A Plague Tale: Innocence is an amazing game. I would rate it a 9/10, and I'm looking forward to the game studio's future projects. Perhaps even another game that spins off from this one. That would just be wonderful.",Recommended

It does not drag on and was a great experience all in all. \n\nThe story threw me for a loop a few times but not in the way like ""Unexpected=Everybody will like it"" Like this new GOT season.

The final boss battle is literally like something out of resident evil 5, it's entirely combat focused which doesn't really work well at all with the set game mechanics and[spoiler]your little innocent brother hugo turns into some rat sorcering demigod because of his sickness, however it's never explained as to how that works or why, it's just there because.\nIt's just a shame such a rich story had to turn into some sort of rat vs soldiers/rats pokemon battle later on.[/spoiler]\nA very, very dissapointing conclusion to an otherwise amazing story driven title, however the ending really let me down i still had +/- 9 hours of an amazingly detailed linear story game with well developed characters, which is rare nowadays.",Recommended
"Well the game has one of the best atmospheres in a game, music is on point graphics are beutiful, besides some clunky animations. Voice acting for the main characters is solid, but the Guards and other Npcs simply just have the same voice. Those things are understandable since the game had a pretty small budget I guess. Overall buy this game, such a great experience.",Recommended

We also have a YouTube channel where we post our first impressions of games.[/url][/code]\n\nI've been meaning to play this game upon seeing trailers and Asobo Studio talk about it last October. A Plague Tale has an engaging premise and after playing through the first chapter, I can say that it continues to be interesting. We are immediately introduced to Amicia and Hugo's family, their priorities and dynamic. On top of that, the game helps you get well-acquainted with stealth mode pretty fast. I'm guessing this will play a HUGE factor in the succeeding chapters. I have some issues with AI reacting too slow in certain circumstances such that mere crouching is considered 'stealthy'. Hopefully, this improves in succeeding chapters. Other than that, I'm looking forward to getting deeper into the story. \n\nIf you're curious about Chapter 1, I made a first gameplay impressions below.

"TLDR:\n+Beautiful graphics\n+Amazing sound design\n+Good story\n+Getting invested in the characters hits he feels.\n-Extremely short\n-Linear ( offers little to no exploration )\n-25-30€ game not worth at 44€\n\nGame is extremely short took me about 12 hours to finish doing everything l could, missed few collectibles tho. \n\nThis game is really linear and offers little to no exploration, but still if you decide to explore its rewarded with small conversations, collectibles and resources.\n\nStory is good not many games are set in this era or have such a dark theme to them. Story has some plot holes and is in no way perfect but still better then average. if you play this game you should definitely try to appreciate scenery, listen to the surroundings and the character conversations.\n\nEven tho this game is short you really get invested in the characters, after helping your little brother trough the entire game it really hits your feels at some points of the game. Tho some puzzles and challenges the game present really take you out of it and make you feel bored.\n\nDefinitely too expensive for what it offers in play time. Most of the production has clearly gone in the beautiful graphics, amazing sound design, and good story writing. \n\n7.5/10",Recommended

"If you liked [i]Ico[/i] or [i]Naughty Dog[/i] style games, you'll probably like this. I was really wowed by the first half, absolutely gorgeous game art and fun storytelling. I felt like the second half sort of tapered off a bit, it didn't quite feel as polished... The ending felt a bit rushed. There's a sort of awkward insertion of the credits between the penultimate and final chapter. It would have been nice if they had wrapped things up a bit more before rolling the credits the first time. \n\nMechanics generally feel alright, they get a bit clunky here and there, but never too much. There was one or two times where I would turn a lamp like 5 degrees off of where it should be and get killed by the environment or forcing me to redo a puzzle that left me saying ""really?""  but these moments were minimal. 7/10, looking forward to seeing more custom IP from this developer.",Recommended

"Simply excellent game. Tightly focussed story doesn't outstay its welcome, the stealth gets off to a slow start, but then you get a really nice drip feed of new abilities (some of them surprising!) to vary things up, and even go on the offensive.

"Aesthetically amazing - graphics, music, atmosphere and voice acting are all top tier.  The setting is unique and the story is of a good quality. Being anchored around the young characters, it is interesting and somewhat though provoking. This time period  is not one often explored in video games, and that this game is anchored in real historical events lends it additional gravitas. \n\nThe gameplay is quite railroaded and you are very much playing through the developers story, rather than telling your own - however I think they have been pretty clear about this through their promotion, so set your expectations accordingly. \n\nEyecandy 10/10\nGameplay 6/10\n\n\n",Recommended

Add Sean Bean to that and well, need to say more.",Recommended
"This is a phenomenal indie game. The gameplay is not like Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice, but it has a similar look and feel, very beautiful and quite polished. So far it is my Game of the Year. It isn't overly difficult but it is a great experience.\nIt is a stealth game that is almost a walking simulator at times, but there are enough puzzles and clever uses of various slingshot ammo to keep it entertaining and interesting. I haven't had so much fun taking down enemies for a long time. But you can often sneak by if you're careful. The story is good with a few fun twists that also add to the gameplay variety.\nIt is a linear, story-driven campaign that reminds me a lot of The Last of Us (without heavy gun combat). It is also a bit like Thief with the sneaking around and putting out torches with your slingshot. It also reminds me of The Last Guardian (minus the platforming), Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons, and A Way Out (but single player). It has a few fun boss fights that reminded me of the 2000s Tomb Raider games, or maybe Baba Yaga from the reboots.\nThe first two hours don't do it justice, but it is worth full price is you like story and character-driven adventures.\n",Recommended

"Alright so, in short, this game is a story driven experience with relatable characters in a fantastic setting, let down by some pretty frustrating gameplay, mostly during stealth sections.\n\nOK, some of it was player incompetence, but still, ""learn by dying"" based mechanics is bad game design in my opinion, and being killed again and again by various guards (that apparently all use the same character model) is extremely frustrating, especially with a checkpoint system, where you may have to redo a few minutes of the sequence, only to fail a bit further down the line and have to redo that whole part of the sequence once again (including waiting for the scene setup dialogue between guards to finish). Of course you expect the player to make some mistakes here and there, but there are also moments throughout the game where it seems you are given little or no chance to plan, and have to redo some of the sequence armed with hindsight in order to progress. \n\nFor the first few chapters, it seemed that a  a non-lethal option to each scenario would be a thing, and I did try this approach as much as possible, however as the game progressed, this approach became a thousand times more frustrating than just killing everything in certain scenarios, and in the end, it seemed better just to take the easiest way out in order to avoid frustration. I guess these days the majority of video game protagonists can be cold blooded killers (in the name of justice and stuff) with little or no consequence to their actions. Who cares about cognitive dissonance anyway, especially if ""innocence"" is in the title of the game.\n\nThe game does make an effort to mix up game mechanics and offer new approaches to different scenarios and this kept things fresh, but this is done in a linear fashion, presenting the player with a new method of attack every now and then, rather than empowering the player with a choice between different approaches. This makes choosing sling upgrades pretty much useless, as you never know quite what the game is going to throw at you next and thus have no idea what to prioritise. Basically just upgrade everything as much as possible and hope for the best.\n\nThe game is visually beautiful, the voice acting is mostly decent and the story is interesting enough, and I really wanted to get lost in the whole experience, unfortunately I just couldn't.\n\nI know some people like the kind of gameplay where you die a lot and that’s fine, after all, games like Dark Souls are famous for this, however when frustration overrules the emotions the game actually intends to evoke, immersion suffers greatly.",Not Recommended

This game reminds me why i love to play games in the first place. Totally worth it.",Recommended
"I'm always supportive of when a journeyman developer can come out with a breakthrough project that delivers an uncompromised single-player experience. Having finished A Plague Tale: Innocence, I hope that Asobo can join the likes of Ninja Theory with Hellblade in critical accolades and commercial success for their fantastic effort. While it obviously lacks the polished production values you might find in the Naughty Dog games it's trying to emulate, A Plague Tale makes up for with memorable characters, an involving story, and a lot of ""heart,"" for lack of a better term. The stealth gameplay is mostly competent with the occasional frustrating instafail sequence, the controls aren't always entirely fluid, but really, what you're mostly playing for is the engaging narrative anchored by some great, emotive performances from the two leads. You can tell that this was a project for the studio unmotivated by how many units it would sell, but on crafting a unique single-player experience that people could enjoy. Everybody likes to complain about the current state of AAA gaming with its focus on live services and microtransactions to continually extract money from people, but fewer will actually support truly weird, creative projects like these. I hope people don't make the same mistake for A Plague Tale because it is worth their recognition.",Recommended
"Well, let's begin.\nKingdom of France, 1349. Life seems normal for those living in the kingdom, despite having to deal with political unrest and all the difficulties that come from simply trying to stay alive. These difficulties, however, are nothing compared to the terrible calamity that is set to strike the kingdom, a plague brought by some vicious creatures, a plague that destroys everything it touches, whether it is nature, animals or humans. When entire armies fall to this, how could a 15 years old girl and her sickly brother survive after losing their home, their family and everything that mattered to them? A Plague Tale: Innocence is the story of how the will to live is stronger than any danger, and how bonds forged out of necessity can make the difference between life and death.\nA Plague Tale: Innocence stars Amicia de Rune and her younger brother Hugo. One fateful day when out hunting with her father Robert, Amicia discovers something sinister that devours life. Hastily returning to the family’s estate, Amicia is soon forced to deal with yet an extremely complicated situation that will change her life forever. The Inquisition is after Hugo de Rune, Amicia’s younger and sickly brother with whom she never truly bonded. Upon the Inquisition’s arrival, Amicia’s mother tasks her with protecting Hugo at all costs, escape the estate and seek Laurentius, who seemingly knows what is afflicting Hugo. Things, however, become more complicated very quickly, as Amicia and Hugo will not only have to deal with the Inquisition seeking them out but also the plague itself, which is starting to ravage the land and spread fear among not only the French population but also the invading English army.\nA Plague Tale: Innocence looked and sounded great on paper, but it’s probably even better than most expected. With an emotional and gripping story enhanced by the charming characters, mature storytelling and themes, a great atmosphere and solid gameplay mechanics, A Plague Tale: Innocence is, without a doubt, one of the best games released this year so far.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wORYxwz1Zlk",Recommended
"Received this as a gift from one of my friends, but I had planned on buying it anyway at some point.\n\nSome occasionally bland stealth sections do not ruin this wonderful game that focuses on narrative, and a unique twist on the historical times of the plague. Clear inspiration from The Last Of Us and Ico when it comes to gameplay, especially in managing a companion and building an emotional connection through gameplay, rather that just cutscenes. Not only a promising sign of things to come from Asobo Studio, but an overall fantastic title that will please fans of well-crafted linear, story driven games.",Recommended
"Gotta say, I really enjoyed playing this, you don't get much in games that are story-driven nowadays but this game is definitely worth the price.

I don't play a lot of stealth games mainly due to them boring me with how slow the game feels but this game has entranced me I thought about it non stop at work and had to beat it. It ties combat with stealth beautifully as well as has an amazing tool mechanic every item is suuuper useful in just about any situation as well as the gameplay itself looks amazing and has one of the best storylines I have ever heard. point is if your thinking of this game id highly recommend it,Recommended

"I've wanted to play this game since I watched the first few trailers and honestly when I actually played through this game it seemed like the chapters were going by quite fast, however I do have to say there are a lot of chapters to this game so don't worry.\n\nI wouldn't say you will finish/complete this game within a day, but if you tried you obviously would be able to. But I would strongly suggest to play through it once without trying to get to the end as fast as possible. The story and character development is pretty interesting along with the twists to the plot that the game has.\n\nI loved the story in this game and would honestly love to see something else like this in the future it was fun and captivating. Seriously a must play or watch if you're into those kinds of things. But none the less it's like one of those games you need to experience.\n\nThe graphics for the game are amazing, along with the performance but it would depend on your system honestly. The gameplay was a little funky in places for example not being able to do certain things in certain areas and guards catching you in weird places etc.\n\nI loved every moment of this game though would strongly recommend if you're into story games. 10/10\n\nJust wish there was a longer story to it because now I'm hoping there's another or at least a similar game like this that will come out soon.\n\n~Blood",Recommended

"*I will update my review when I have beaten the game but here are my thoughts so far*\n\nI had a feeling that smaller developers would pick up the torch dropped by the triple AAA developers when it comes to single player narrative driven games. The always online loot/grind model of recent games is really not my cup of tea and honestly this is not where i expected the industry to end up when I was playing my N64 and dreaming of what games would eventually be like. Luckily the industry is huge and just when I was becoming concerned that single player narrative focused games would go by the way side this game comes along. Much more than a walking simulator but also lacking the bloat of current open world RPGs, A Plague Tale strikes an excellent balance and provides long sip of something missing from the industry. This game is excellent. Also for PC players...everything worked right out of the gate. This game is finished and polished.",Recommended

I'm not the biggest gamer when it comes to singleplayers but oof, this game owned.\n\nPros: \n• No performance issues (Used a 980 for this and had 65-80+ fps and never lagged once on maxed settings.)\n• Nice graphics\n• Controller support\n• Movement, looting and changing ammo is straight forward\n• Sneaking around is hella fun\n• The atmosphere of the Plague, Rats & Murderous men give a real feeling of ""don't f*ck up or you're dead""\n• The action can be really intense at times. GLHF\n\nCons:\n• Wish the game was a lot longer. Finished the game in around 13-14 hours \n• Game would be more worth the price tag of £25-30.. 40 is a bit much for what you get.\n\nNOTE: No side quests or other stuff, this is NOT some Skyrim, Quest, Quest, Quest, Side Quest, OOOO A cave! type of deal.. This is purely a main story game.\n\nI'm going to leave it there but in all honesty the game is really worth the play! \nGood luck to you!",Recommended
"Good story, had a few things that didn't make a ton of sense towards the end/were unexplained, and there was one section of the game that was just filler.\n\nThe gameplay is... mediocre.  \n-The stealth was sufficient, but not something to boast of.  \n-Combat is the alternative to stealth, and... it's quite boring.  Your shots are aimed with auto-aim and you're using a sling.  Right click to aim, left click to shoot.  It becomes a bit mindless towards the end, albeit, with the only other 'weapon' that you get which I'll omit for the sake of spoilers.  \n- There are puzzles which range from simple to mildly difficult because it was difficult to see something. \n -The last thing in this category is the collectibles, which add a small bit of lore, though they feel unnecessary and tacked on.  I never ran out of resources when crafting things.  Quite easy in that regard.\n\nThe mood and music are high points, these are why I plowed through the game.  It's dark, albeit, not as dark as I was expecting as a result of many of these reviews.  The only negative thing in this regard is the actions taken of the child, Hugo, who acts like he's missing a few brain cells.  You might be able to rationalize this as him being so young, but he's downright suicidal at times.\n\nOverall, I don't think this game is worth the asking price of $45, but I do think it is worth getting at a significantly lower price..  If it goes on sale down to $30, that'd probably be a lot better.  It's around 6-7 hours of gameplay/storytime, and not much replayability..\n",Recommended

"A very solid stealth/puzzle game, reminiscent of hellblade and dishonored. You play as children, so it's not a brutal frontal assault kind of game. Stealth isn't an option, it's the key feature of the game.\n\nPros:\n-Amazing attention to detail in the graphics. The game is very crisp and floored me from the very start.\n-Good, memorable characters. Even the characters that showed up fairly briefly were very colorful in personality\n-Structured mystery plot. Plain and simple the game takes a good focus on storytelling.\n-Easy to understand but still challenging and engaging to execute. The mechanics are very simple, but timing and planning and strategy all come into play.\n-No bugs, no crashes, no real hiccups. It's pretty smooth, I've only had some minor clipping and only because I was rushing a second attempt, and it was barely even noticeable.\n\nCons:\n-Personally I found the plot telegraphed itself a lot. I found myself able to predict the major plot extremely early on, [spoiler] and even found myself starting a scene just knowing that a major character was about to die at the end of it [/spoiler]\n-I found some of the interactions a bit misplaced towards the middle, like there was a hole in the game plot they needed to hurriedly patch up (IE characters behaving as though more familiar than they were)\n- The ending is kind of open ended and doesn't explain a lot of questions I had [spoiler] IE Why were Hugo's parents trying to slow it down and the first half of the game is focused around it when the first thing his mother tells him is to embrace it when they meet later. Counterproductive to everything she had been trying to do? That's just one of them I had. [/spoiler]\n\nOverall it's very cohesive and fun to play. It's a game done pretty well and is satisfying to complete. The animations have a way of some parts feeling programmed while others feel very real, possibly even within seconds of each other, but there's a lot more good than the mildly distracting (you can't even call it bad).\n\nI think I'm looking forward to more titles from this publisher.",Recommended

The music, atmosphere and constant element of caution leaves you wondering where to step next and whether there are soldiers or masses of rats waiting around the corner.\n\nHugo's childlike take on the world around him was something I find very believable and I felt quite protective of him through the reactions to animals, people, fear and death around him expressed by his voice actor. Amicia is a great character too and she is definitely well thought out a young girl who doesn't always know what to do under stress. The puzzles and ways of progressing and getting past threats are quite inventive and fit seamlessly into the story without any Recommended gripes.\n\nI really enjoy this game and hope others do too.",Recommended

"I've never left a review on steam before this. However, felt this would be the best game to start. This is easily the best game of 2019 so far. Shining through the sea of AAA devs releasing unfinished games powered by loot boxes and promises of future content. You have this gem. An amazing story which kept me at my seat for hours because I HAD to know what was going to happen next. I've read another review which expressed issues with frame rate drops and straying from the intended path makes the game unplayable. I can tell you I've not experienced either. There is an obvious path for the player to follow. However, you are not punished for not taking it. You simply have to find an alternate path or way to clear an obstacle. The only thing I hate about this game is knowing it'll be a long time before I play another game this good. If you're tired of same old crap from recent releases PICK THIS UP. It'll be well worth it.",Recommended

If you are looking for a game that is action set piece driven this is not for you, but if you are looking for a beautifully detailed world and great story look no further. \n\nThe main draw here is the story and relationship of the main protagonist and her little brother. The game does a wonderful job of depicting this bleak world of lost innocence.",Recommended

"I don't do many reviews, but for games that I absolutely feel like I should, I can't help but to do so.  I played from start to finish in a single day, and I have to say, Asobo Studies, how could you do this to me?  I've loved every second of this, from the graphics, to the ideologies, to the setting, atmosphere, gameplay, everything.   The characters felt real, and varied.  They had personalities that were their own, and I honestly, HONESTLY cared about each and every one of them.  \n\nSome of the fights, [spoiler] like with The Captain [/spoiler] were a little anti-climactic, while the dialogue itself was fitting and wonderful.  \n[spoiler] When Rodric died, I actually teared up, and it reverberated. [/spoiler]  [spoiler] Though, when Arthur died, I didn't feel too much, but I put that toward not having played much with him around. [/spoiler]\n\nThe take on the bubonic plague were completely epic, with death and sickness sweeping through all of Europe, but in this case [spoiler] being an ancient disease [/spoiler] was a great take on it.  \n\nThe animation was a little strange, like with Amicia's neck being a little elongated until she wears her new clothes, and the lip sync didn't line up, but I take that to being a different language than English (since it seems to take place in France rather than England).\n\nOverall, I give this game an absolute 20/10, and look forward to anything else you put out.  I'll keep on playing through A Plague Tale: Innocence and find all the little things I missed the first and second time around.",Recommended

"Usually I don't write reviews, but I have to make an exception this time. The strengths of this game are the impactful atmosphere, beautiful world and story. The gameplay was pretty fun in my eyes, but you have to decide yourself, if it offers enough for your liking. Unlike many other games your companion, the little brother, doesn't get more and more annoying as the story progresses. He is very helpful, especially later in the game when he gets an essential part of the gameplay. Moreover, crafting isn’t a pain in the ass and makes sense, since you have to craft different types of ammunition to survive in this by rats infested world. I didn’t encounter any bugs or performance issues. My best spent 45 bucks for a long time.\n10/10 Would slingshot again!\n",Recommended

"Pros:\nA well written storyline with an interesting plot and a small cast of characters.\n\nCharacter models and the world are well detailed and polished, and the animations are realistic and well made.\n\nThere is a nice crafting and upgrading system that uses the resources you gather as you journey though the chapters. They range from giving Amicia more space in her bags to carry more resources and reducing the noise she makes, to upping her prowess with the slingshot and alchemy skills she learns throughout the story.\n\nThere are collectibles hidden around the world for you to find if you're patient and curious enough to look around your surroundings, and certain items (I believe) are displayed at your base, once you've reached that point in the story to unlock it.\n\nPuzzles are light and fun, they usually don't require too much energy or thought to figure out, and if you do find yourself lost, usually one of the characters will give a hint or the game may show you a button to press to focus the camera on the object you need to interact with to advance on your journey.\n\nEven though you have a set path in all chapters and there is no open world, the level design of the world is still large enough that you don't feel confined or controlled to go one way and there is enough space to explore a little before continuing to the next area. The path ahead usually always makes sense enough that you feel confident pushing on, like it was always your choice to go that direction even though you're only allowed to go in said direction to begin with.\n\nThough Amicia is the main character you play, there is one chapter where you play as little Hugo! (which surprised me and reminded me of a chapter in ""The Last of Us"" and that gave me sweet feels)\n\n----\n\nCons:\nPuzzles do not always react the way you want them to, especially the area of effect light sources cast. Sometimes, even though you may think you can run past that small area of shadow between the lights, you won't always make it! The horde o'rats see all!\n\nCombat was designed to be long distanced only. The only weapon Amicia wields is her slingshot, so if a guard gets too close, she is instantly one-shotted and there is no way to escape their hold because there is no grapple cue to dodge away from until you unlock a craftable alchemy item that can knock them out before they land their hit. There has been many times where I wish Amicia was armed with at least a small dagger to help her when they get too close, but I understand how the game was mainly designed with stealth in mind.\n\nAlso to note; the crafting wheel opens in real time, and Amicia will stand still while you select or craft the item you wish to use, so you have to be very strategic while using it in combat.\n\nThere are certain key moments when the game lagged for me, though they were quite rare, and only while doing puzzle instances that required a lot of light sources appearing at once or fast movements like a cart rolling down a hill at high speed. However my computer isn't a heavily modded speed demon, just modded slightly above average with the game running on high, so I can't say it will do the same for someone else that may have a better system than mine. Though usually I do not lag playing other games, depending on how they are optimized. Just putting it out there. I'm sure it can be patched if so.\n\nAlthough the storyline was much longer than I expected it to be the replayability for this game (for me) feels very low. Once the game is completed you are given an option to replay a specific chapter, so you can go back and find any collection pieces you might have missed. It's a nice option, but I've never been too much to care about collecting every single collectable item in games. However, I know some gamers do, and it is nice to see that there's an option to go back and find it for them!\n\n----\nWith all said, I really did enjoy my time playing the game. I wish there were key plot points explained in greater detail, but over all the story is gripping enough to keep you pulled in and the banter between the main cast of characters was enjoyable to listen to. Especially for someone who likes playing episodic themed games like Telltale's games or Dreamfall Chapters!\n\nI'd recommend the game, especially since the price is lower than most AAA titles♥",Recommended
"I'm only on chapter five of the game but man this game is amazing. The visuals are stunning, the story keeps you curious, and the characters are easy to adore. If you are looking for a game with a great story then buy A Plague Tale: Innocence. It is   definitely one of the best games I've played this year and I have to say it is well worth the $45. Now go kill some rats!",Recommended
"TL;DR\n""A Plague Tale: Innocence"" is an extremely well designed story driven, linear title, with exceptional 'sound beside gameplay orchestrations' and impressive floods of rodents.  Horror, drama, and immersive gameplay amalgamate into a brilliant piece of art.  Live, breathe, and maybe even die in this terrifying rendition of the Black Plague.\n\nHoly Fuck Me. Where do I begin.\n\nI guess with a summary of the game's introduction.  The game takes place during the Black Plague, albeit with some wicked embellishments. You play as Amicia, a young french girl and her younger brother Hugo. The introduction which serves as a tutorial for a few of the games mechanics also has some fantastic character development.  Within minutes I was smiling, nearly crying, and trying -- to keep my mouth shut at this games fantastic visuals and storytelling, all while learning how to fucking snipe some apples, medieval style.  Right from the get go I was impressed with the graphics, and while they aren't ground breaking, the lighting and setting has got me swooning over every god ray that penetrates the forest canopy.  Without spoiling too much, things quickly go awry and the sudden change in mood is reflected wonderfully by this games backup string instrumentals.  Something eerie lurking around? A low string on a violin is continuously strung, slowly, and unwavering, signaling dreadful pungent polluted air, or maybe evil lurking around you.  Oh! What's that? Did a guy just get fucking brutally murdered all of a sudden? Violin Sting!  The music is so well timed with all of the games details it's fantastic.  It really escalates the drama.\n\nOnto gameplay.  If you're a fan of stealth games expect a walk in the park. Hugo your younger brother is only 5 and can become scared if left alone, but he fits into small spaces and can help you get through certain areas.  When you haven't explicitly told him to brave into a gap or through a jail cell grate, you hold his hand and guide him around essentially playing both Amicia and Hugo at the same time.  It may sound clunky to you but the controls handle quite nicely.  There's only one issues I've had with the controls so far but more on that later.  And! If you're a fan of ""The Floor is Lava!"" then you've really struck gold.  Prepare to play, ""The Floor is Infested with Hundreds of Thousands of Tiny Starving Flesh Eating Mammals!"".  \n\nAnimations... So far just about all of the animation have really impressed me.  The moment I noticed Amicia's nostrils puffing out a little when she breathed in deeply I was gone.  And the rats, don't even get me started.  The horror!  It's fantastic. The amount of entities on screen is truly amazing. If you look closely, they squirm around and step over each other wildly, viscerally -- climbing and clawing each other just to get a bite of whatever's living, and if you look from afar it's as if a massive black ocean is fluidly engulfing obstacles and pouring out of holes in the walls.  Watching the swarm of rodents scurry hurriedly away from any source of light is exciting, and carving paths through the oceans of rats with torch in hand is satisfying.\n\nNow onto the only negative I've drawn from this game so far.  It's a really minor thing.  Sometimes when I press the spacebar to climb over obstacles it dodges Amicia backwards and it's gotten me caught and killed a few times now. Both by rats and humans.  So far it's the only ""bug"" (if you can even call it that) I've found and I'm extremely impressed with the polish on this game thus far.  That being said I haven't finished the game yet and if I find any damning bugs or horrible design later on I'll be sure to post it here.\n\nIn conclusion, this game is on of the BEST story driven games I've ever played and at the very least a quality linear tale for you to enjoy.  The price is certainly reasonable for this games, polish, story, and design, and I can't remember playing such a good story driven title since ""Bioshock: Infinite"". (and even that one in ended in flames).  Hope my review helps you decide to buy! I know you wont be disappointed!\n\n",Recommended

" The visuals in this game are quite exceptional and it really drives home the atmosphere. I didn't experience any significant bugs or issues while playing. The story contains only a few light emotion moments, which is less than I would have liked. The puzzles were easy, but that didn't bother me because I felt that wasn't the focus of the game. Overall it's an interesting, if a bit ho hum story. The final action sequences were a bit more arcade-style than I would like, but I suppose that makes sense for them being the last few battles, I think I would have preferred something more puzzle oriented. In summary, I emphasize the price point as being for the visuals and not for the game systems or the story. I do not think it is bad, but at it's full price the story is interesting but not exceptional.",Recommended

"One of the best games I've ever played. The plot is magnificent and grabs the player instantly. If you have some money and not sure what game to get, this would be a great choice for you.",Recommended
"I didn't think I'd be able to find a game that matches ""Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice"" in terms of tone and emotional investment. And yet, here we are. I completed the game just today, and here is the good, the bad, and the ugly.\n\nThe good is the story. While it wasn't flawlessly executed, I had no trouble getting through it. In fact, I found it engaging. It did have some pacing problems in the beginning and it started to come apart at the seams, especially in the third act, but it does manage to pull itself through before it completely collapses under its own weight. There are a lot of elements to the story that I don't feel was well shown. And I feel like the explanation for events was very unsatisfactory. The ending was good, though.\n\nThe characters were really what held the story together. The developers did an excellent job in striking the balance in characters by making them flawed, but not annoying and immature, which they could have easily done. Amicia is an angry girl. Sure, she's not a brat about it, but she is angry and this anger often shows in spurts of frustration. She's not trying to be mean or hurt people, but she is dealing with feelings that haven't been resolved. \n\nThis game is technically an escort game, but it doesn't feel like one. It's kind of like that bad game ""Amy"" where you also escort a kid around. The difference between ""Amy"" and Plague Tale: Innocence is that Plague Tale actually did it right. Hugo isn't getting himself into trouble every five seconds. Yes, he will cry if you try to leave him alone (just like you would cry if I left you alone in a plague ridden hell hole full of rats and people trying to kill you) but he's more of an asset then a liability. And I know what most people are thinking: ""Is there that moment that he ignores all sense of self preservation and runs off into the clutches of the bad guy? Because that's in every other game with children."" The answer is yes, that's in there, but it's done surprisingly well. First off, the story builds itself well enough that when Hugo does do that, you actually understand him. Secondly, Amicia doesn't follow up Hugo's foolish action by being an idiot and blindly running in to rescue him. Finally, it ends up Hugo was right to do what he did, so you can't complain.\n\nThe bad of the game is how it was advertised. It's being advertised as a stealth game. It isn't. It's a puzzle game with stealth aspects. The AI is far too simple and the game mechanics far too basic to be a Recommended stealth game. Don't get me wrong, it's interesting combination because for the most part, you do have to think about what you're doing before you do it. So lit a stick, what are you going to do with it? It only burns for so long, so you best plan how you're going to move before you light it. So you threw a rock at the guard's lantern, now what? However, it doesn't match up to other stealth games.\n\nI would also like to point out that often times it felt like i was playing an extended tutorial. The game does hold your hand just as much as Amicia holds Hugo's. And that got a little annoying.\n\nThere also isn't a lot of replay value in the game either. Like I said, the story starts to crumble in the third act, and so there's no real analysis to do on the story either.\n\nThen there's the ugly. Oh boy. I just have one question for the developers. How the hell did you mess up pushing cart mechanics? You push a damn cart. That's it. However, this game somehow messed it up with some pretty wonky controls. It's kind of silly. \n\nAnd then the menu. Don't get me started on the menu. I mean, it's nice and all, until you have to use it. The wheel system that they implemented for your inventory is just not good. There's is a lot of times where you have to switch ammo on a fly, but the menu isn't built for quick switching. It's downright broken, in fact.",Recommended

"Alright, so guys if you want a straight up review I am going to give an honest opinion. I play alot of singleplayer games, and this is a gem, although its certaintly not the best game I ever played, its far from the worse. It is one of the better games I have played singleplayer in a longtime, but each game has its flaws.\n\nPros:\nGorgeous Graphics\nRuns Flawless on my PC\nGripping Story (actually im stunned at the quality of it)\n\nCons: \nStealth isnt bad, but isnt anything overly hard or different than other stealth games\nPuzzles aren't super hard but atleast you have to think a bit.\n\nIt is however linear with a bit of room for some exploration. Which is fine, if a game is linear but does a good job telling its story it doesnt need sidequests or open world. Not every game has to be OPEN WORLD. I am quite enjoying it and sure there are harder stealth games than this, but just because its easy doesnt mean I dont enjoy it. I still do. And the story and graphics are amazing. \n\nTake it for what its worth. Game is worth the money, just dont expect a dark a hardcore stealth game. \n\nAnd just remember they are not a AAA studio so it will not be perfect. In my opinion this is one of the better games singleplayer games with a amazing story ive played in the last 10 years. Gameplay isnt anything new, but at the same time you can overlook some weaknesses for other strong points. Still worth playing in my opinion.",Recommended

"I don't think you need to rush to buy this. It can be as annoying as you might expect a game-long escort mission to be. I have seen the AI do some incredibly stupid things. It doesn't seem well optimized as I can hear my PC working harder than on any other game I have. This is far from the most clever stealth I have ever seen. You have one or two options in every situation, throw a rock at conveniently placed metal items, or throw a clay pot. It never really becomes more clever, just more frustrating in scenes where they have you trying to get past 6 enemies at once. It's not really open in the sense that you ever see multiple ways you could address a situation, at least not in what I've played so far. It's always pretty clear that the game needs you to do A, B, and C to get yourself through the area.\n\nI hate games like this with collectibles because it is immersion-breaking that you are supposed to be worried in this intense situation, but I am stopping and checking random corners and corridors for items. On the other hand, it's already not a content-heavy game so there would be less to do without items to pick up. But that doesn't make it an interesting task. And I don't know yet how the game might handle going back to get what you missed. Nor will I probably care to 100% it. \n\nI think it makes a very compelling game for about half of the price it is selling for at release. \n\nI hope it does something in the remaining hours that will make me want to insist that people play it. Otherwise so far, it has nice graphics, I am adequately invested in the story, but I don't think anyone absolutely needs to experience it. \n\nI hate that stream reviews are supposed to boil down to 'do you recommend it', yes or no. I wouldn't tell anyone dying to play it that they're absolutely going to hate it. Nor would I tell anyone considering playing it that they absolutely need to. I'm seeing some overly positive reaction to a game that so far seems meh to me, so I guess I'll tick mine as a negative.",Not Recommended

Very fun! Lots of puzzles and great graphics!,Recommended
"TLDR; 6.5/10, not worth the money due to the decline in the quality of the game in it's 2nd half\n\nSo. Let's talk about this game.\n\nA Plague Tale: Innocence. Imagine a fantastical realism game that takes Rule of Rose mixed with Amnesia: The Dark Descent, along with some stealth mechanics and (limited) puzzles for good measure. The reason I pick these games to compare is because, like Rule of Rose, the main characters are children, and the gameplay mechanics are frustrating. I pick Amnesia, because the setting and the puzzles have a similiar vibe.\n\nThere are some good things about this game. The visuals, the atmosphere, the shock factor, and the level design! \nUnfortunately, there are also some really bad things. The weakest, WEAKEST things by far are the narrative and the gameplay mechanics.\n\nThe first half of the game is honestly great. I feel like the story was progressing nicely, the characters relationships were being developed, I felt like I had to do some really really awful things in order to advance the story, and I don't mind being forced into those descisions because I felt the reasoning was compelling enough. The atmosphere of some environments were chilling. There are definitely a few moments that caught me by surprise (in a good way) with how gross they were. Basically, I was really, really enjoying the game at this point.\n\nUnfortunately, the game falls off HARD around the second half. I think it's because they simply added too many things. \n\nThe gameplay gets more complicated as they introduce items, and for the most part I hardly ended up using them after the first time they were introduced. This can be quite annoying because switching between ammunition means I have to scroll through these useless types of ammo or reach my hand across the keyboard, and then it's hard to know which button to press because it is not displayed on the screen. I could understand this in the immersive UI mode, but I wasn't playing with that UI. Also even though its a ""stealth"" game it feels like a majority of the time it was simply easier to just use force to get through sections because there's absolutely no repurcussions for doing so.\n\nSome characters are added in the 2nd half that feel really weak, and I think this is because a lot of them feel added for one gameplay mechanic that, again, hardly gets used, and then the writers are like.. uh.. what now? There is only one side character I could see as being neccessary: [spoiler]Lucas, the alchemist apprentice.[/spoiler] The writing of the characters really starts to just bomb so hard. The villian is not compelling and is really one-toned, which is probably the biggest narrative oversight. I'm not at all convinced by what happens to Hugo in the slightest because it just seems So Random, and overall it just feels really confused. The line between ""fantastical"" and ""realism"" causes the game to go a bit too far in the fantastical direction in the second half, and some things that seemed dangerous just seem hilarious and laughable.\n\nTHE WORST ASPECT BY FAR IS WHEN FRUSTRATING GAMEPLAY AND IMPORTANT NARRATIVE EVENTS HAPPEN SIMULTANEOUSLY. There are times where you will die and you don't just go back into what you were trying to do, you have to sit through a whole conversation. There are times where this happens and the whole mood the story is trying to build up dies. There are many times where I just became so disinterested in the narrative because of having to do a clunky event over and over.\n\nThe reason games like Rule of Rose get away with awful gameplay mechanics is because they have a compelling story. The reason Amnesia's gameplay is so good is because you feel like whats happening is real, there's a give and take happening.\n\nThe only thing this game truly has to fall back on are visuals. Plague's gameplay isn't compelling, and the beliveability of it's story simply doesn't hold up the further you get into it, and is only hindered by the clunky gameplay.\n\nIt is not at all worth the money, but if you are interested in the story I would wait until someone uploads it to YouTube so you can get it without experiencing the frustration of playing the actual game.",Not Recommended
"We need to applaud this game.\n\nIt feels like forever since a played a game like this.\n\nDoes it do anything new? No\nIs the narrative amazing? Well no\nIs the gameplay innovative? No it feels like its been done before\n\nThen is this game any good? Big yes.\n\nThis game take you on an adventure with a sibling couple fleeing both the inquisition and the mysterious and supernatural plague. An adventure full of horror and setbacks, while you still manage to fight your forward. It is all so well put together. The dialog is surprisingly good, the characters are believable and the story is alright, but is mostly lifted by the characters.\n\nI love this game, because it's really a breath of fresh air in this dark time ""plagued"" by early access, survival, building, lootbox, fps, microtransaction and so on ridden times.\n\nPros:\nOkay story\nGood atmosphere   \nBelievable characters\nSome nice puzzles from time to time\nThe plague is actually interesting and scary in a way\n\nCons:\nThe gameplay is clunky at times\nIt is pretty repetitive\nThe inquisition is inhumanly evil for the sake of plot\nFew bugs (very rare for me)",Recommended

This is worth it for the story and adventure and control and audio make the settings in this world amazing, no bugs or crashes throughout my entire play through this game brings back the single player narrative. This is what games should aspire to be!",Recommended
"After 10 hours into the game, my impressions are overwhelmingly positive. This game is a gem, offering a compelling story starring relatable characters, the graphics are stunning (those lights !), the musics really powerful and immersive. The interactions between Amicia and Hugo are adorable. The rats bring a fitting tension. I was afraid I'd find the gameplay too directive but so far I don't feel like the game forces me doing anything, it's pretty instinctive. My only regret is the animations being a little bit too uptight. \nI'd say go for it !",Recommended
"Watched the trailer of A Plague Tale: Innocence and the opening scene alone made me buy this game in an instant. It reminded me of Senua's Sacrifice, which in my book is a freaking masterpiece.\n\nI was not disappointed. A Plague Tale: Innocence delivers an amazing experience across the board. Storytelling, environment, music, overall tone, graphics, voice acting, you name it - everything is truly outstanding.\n\nEnvironment artists deserve a special mention here. The amount of detail they put into the world is simply incredible. Every little thing feels authentic, from the Middle Ages architecture, through clothing, armor, common items, to livestock, terrain, rivers, trees and everything else.\n\nThe only things I'd like to see improved are facial animations during dialogue, transitions between animations and positional audio.\n\nOverall a solid 9.5/10. A must buy.",Recommended

"Not another bloody bell...\n\nThis is an amazing game. Just the general feel of it really pulls you into the story unfolding. The music is wonderfully paced giving you moments of relief and moments of lingering horror. The characters personalities are all very well developed, both sympathizing and becoming frustrated with their behavior. The story after all revolves around two kids and like kids they don't always understand the severity of a situation. Which gives the gruesome things that occur so much more weight when you start to realize these kids were once sheltered and living a life of comfort, now watching as war, plague, and death come eating away everything in a very literal way in some cases.",Recommended
"An amazing game and one of the few games I did not have buyer's remorse after playing. \n\nIt does suffer from FPS drops a couple of times in the game and the AI can be a little wonky, but small bugs aside, Plague is an amazing game and well worth a playthrough. \n\nIf you like heavy story games with a little bit of Lara Croft action and crafting in it, you can't go wrong with this game.",Recommended
"I'm really enjoying this game. To be honest, I've had an envious eye on some of the AAA PS4 exclusives in recent times. This is probably the nearest thing on PC to something along those lines. It kind of reminds me of Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons as well, if anyone knows that one.\n\nI really liked how the game brought the player into the story. A bit reminiscent of Dragon Age: Origins (the city elf story anyway) and Kingdom Come: Deliverance in that regard - beginning in a mundane environment before things begin to spiral and become very tense, as oppose to throwing you into the middle of everything and expecting you to care.\n\nThe gameplay isn't particularly complex. It's a mixture of puzzles, stealth and some fighting but it does just enough to satisfy. The real strength of this game is in it's storytelling, characters and immersive environments. I've been dying to play a game like this for a while and there isn't a great deal of these kind of games on PC.\n\nAlso, it runs just about ok on my 5 year old PC and looks stunning. Big thumbs up.",Recommended
Very refreshing game to play in 2019!\nthank you Asobo studio for your hard work. for years develop this game.\nreally looking forward for next IP in future,Recommended
"This is an absolute beautiful game.  So far i've played about 2 hours and I think it is totally worth it.  Of course there are a few bugs with rendering things, but it's still an awesome looking game.  I love the mechanics of sneaking around and the use of the sling and alchemy.  The historical relevance is pretty damn cool.  The black plague and the 100 years war ravishing the lands.  But then it has it's own little cool twist with this sort of magic you could say.  And then there is the best part of the game and what the developers pushed for.  The story of Hugo and Amicia is a heart rending story.  It shows like in the title their innocence.  they still want to act like children, but at the same time they had their parents killed, they've seen massive piles of bodies and have men hunting them down.  Hands down this is an 8/10 for me so far.  I can't wait to see what else they do with this franchise.  because for sure they have to do more with A Plague Tale.  The title makes it seem like there will be more so im hyped.  Hopefully a seperate but interwined story with it's own special mechanics.",Recommended

AMAZING!!!,Recommended
"After 4 hours of playing, this game is just awesome. Who loves LoU, probably also loves this game. The control and handling of the figure, the crafting of objects, the improvement of equipment, indicates that the developers did not copy it, but were inspired by it. The variety between quiet and fighting passages is very well done. Easy puzzles, stealth passages, special enemies everything seems just perfect. In contrast to LoU, you have to fight here with huge herd of rats or the Inquisition. The use of fire against the rats, just something new. The graphics and the setting of the areas is just awesome. Who has not always wanted to wade through a battlefield with 10,000 dead bodies? I'm currently on Act 7 and hope that the Game Story moderately has much to offer. 10/10, because I have not found anything that displeases me or that I'm not happy with. The German Synchro is also well done.",Recommended
"Videogames industry, has lowered my expectations and made me skeptical about almost every game i see these days. it's wonderful when there are still titles like this which restores my hope.\n\nBeautiful, heartwarming and heartbreaking. it does not try to be ground breaking, it's simply taking safe steps toward an entertaining experience.",Recommended
"Absolutely incredible! If your like me, always saying you want a return to the epic linear story game, then this is perfect. The story is unique and gripping. It non-stop has you on the edge of your seat wondering what is going to happen next. Now the story is out of the way, lets talk looks. Hands down the most beautiful game i have EVER played. The nature scenes come to life and the darker, grittier city scenes make you feel like you are actually walking through a plague riddled middle-age France.  This is an absolute MUST buy if you want that story rich, beautiful, unique game to not only keep you entertained, but to suck you in and make you  forget the world around you for a few hours.",Recommended

[/spoiler]\n The game is beautifully done both in story telling, graphics and game mechanic's. The stealth can get a little old, but you are a young girl with very little training in the combative arts, so it's realistic that you would choose stealth over combat. The story keeps you hooked and has you asking a lot of questions early on. This is not a Disney story by any means, it's harsh and brutal.

Even more after knowing the story.\nThe visual is awesome, pure art, I like the atmosphere of the game. \nKudos to Asobo's artists who made a good job for its visual. \nEven more for the music. Good job for its composers and audio designers.\nTo be honest, I dont know anything about music and sound design but I can feel it when its good for my taste and the game when it match the atmosphere. You know, sometimes a good art needs a good music and sound to complete it and made the atmosphere feels real.\n\nFrom the start, I know I'm going to experience repetitive gameplay or maybe bug, bad AI, because this game is too focused on story. Just like the other semi-indie games out there. No one can blame that. But if you thrive about story, then sometimes you'll think to the hell with that, right?\n\nNot complete it yet but I'd say you'll love it if you play this game for its story.\nMaybe will update it after completing it.",Recommended

"I'm a sucker for anything gothic/ medieval but not usually into stealth/ walking simulators that this game appeared to be.\nI took a chance on it and was hooked immediately.\nStunning graphics (getting over 100 fps on ultra with an RTX 2080/ I7-8700K @ 1440p), fantastic sound quality and a story that just grips you from the very beginning.\nSo far I'm on chapter 2 and am going to take my time. I don't want this game to end anytime soon.\nI can tell already that the devs/ story writers have some real talent for translating emotions and genuine tension and I'm going to be avoiding spoilers until I'm done.\nI have a horrible feeling that this story is not going to have a happy ending and there'll be traumatic moments along the way; but I'm sure I'll enjoy every minute of it.\n10/10",Recommended
"Simply put... stunning! \nThis has to be one of the most beautifully optimized games I've ever played.\nI'm shocked such a small studio has pulled this off.\nIf you're a fan of stealth action games then ""Plague Tale: Innocence"" is the game for you.",Recommended

Really good story and atmosphere.,Recommended
"I don't normally pay full price for games on release, but seeing the marketing for this game had me intrigued. So I treated myself and bought the game ready to install for release. So far I am happy with my decision. \n\n2.5 hours in and I feel like I'm really just getting started with the meat and bones of the story. That's not to say it's a slow start, rather that the character introductions, theme, and atmosphere as so well done and expertly integrated into the game-play that if feels like you're reading a book, watching a movie and playing a game all in one. \n\nNot much more I can say really, the strength of this game is in the atmosphere of it, which if you let it will suck you in entirely. \n\nEdit. I'm now 6+ hours into the game and the narrative is still going strong, that passed the value for money threshold for me. Also forgot to mention how good the music is.",Recommended

"A Plague Tale Innocence is a neat game with a great theme and a unconventional approach to stealth gameplay. It all works well together aside from the aforementioned fiddly bits which don’t feel right at times. That said, if you can battle through the less favourable moments you will find a captivating experience that handles stealth and story-telling very well. Hats off then to Asobo for making a chilling, gritty but engaging game with wonderful audio visuals that should keep players well-hooked.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFNpNNA4XZo",Recommended

"I returned RAGE 2- which was an absolute piece of trash, and picked us this absolute gem of a game, everything about this title is quality. ENJOY!",Recommended
"After finishing this game, I must say that I highly recommend it to others, however there are definitely things that need to be said as warnings that may put off some people.\n\nThis game has an amazing story, which is the backbone of the game and what makes it such an experience. It is the gameplay where it falls a bit short at times.\n\nThe gameplay is quite mundane and can be a bit repetitive at times, however I did find as the game went on, it did eventually get to a point where the gameplay was challenging. This was about 75% of the way through, so if you want a hardcore difficult game from the get go, this isn't for you.\n\nAnother thing to mention is the AI. This game has a very oldschool feel when it comes to the AI, as there are only very basic things they can and will do. I found a lot of the time NPCs would detect me when I felt like they really shouldn't, and vice versa, which made it feel a bit inconsistent.\n\nOverall I definitely think the story is good enough to justify the gameplay, but if story based games aren't your thing, do not bother buying this.",Recommended
The Rats of Us. 10/10,Recommended
Way better than Rage 2.,Recommended
"This is a fun Older SIster simulator. Throughout the game, you collect various younger siblings that you need to take care of. They are basically worthless and it really makes you appreciate how much older sisters have to do to take care of their nearly suicidal siblings.\n\nThe game uses lighting to control enemy swarms and vision. This is very cool from a technical standpoint, but every now and then, a shadow lands on you because you tried to light a torch from the wrong side of your worthless younger sibling and you get pushed into rats and die. This is not frequent, but it has happened to me ~ 10 times in 8 hours. Luckily, auto-saves and checkpoints are frequent and, reliable older sister that you are, you persevere. \n\nGood game.",Recommended

"The game is stunning, engaging, etc,  but I dont know why regardless of my preset ultra or low, the cpu temperatures reach 100ºC. Its not my processor nor its my thermal paste, every other game like Battlefront 2, Overwatch, and other games are running on max settings 60fps and never get past 70~80°C.

"Please support this game, we need more small game studios these days and i can already tell this is going to be one of my favorite games of the year! PLEASE ADD ULTRAWIDE SUPPORT!",Recommended
"Pros:\n- Beautiful graphics\n- Gripping Story\n- Well done sound tracks\n- Unique game with an interesting take on the genre\n\nCons:\n- Buggy AI\n- Game is prone to FPS drops and freezing\n- Multiple bugs which can force you to restart from your last checkpoint\n- Doing things out of order / in a different way then intended (resources instead of the environment) can freeze the game\n- No ultrawide support\n- Short (EDIT: Finished the game within 8 hours, despite dealing with bugs. Just to add a time frame)\n\nDespite being an incredible game, I cannot recommend it at the moment. The AI in the game are very buggy, doing something in the wrong order, or using resources instead of an environmental item, can lead to the entire game becoming unplayable, or forcing you to reload a checkpoint. \n\nThe companion AI, have a habit of running away from duo objectives, making progress tedious at times (having to do the same part twelve times before it worked) etc. There are issues with the frame rates, there can often be large drops even on more modern hardware (1080ti / i7-8700k). \n\nThe game-play itself is truly great, but it's the smaller issues which feel like they ruin the experience. Effectively, this is more of an interactive movie, where your skill will impact the length of it. If these are fixed, or if it goes on sale - it'll be worth getting 100%. However as it stands right now, the game costs too much money for the issues it currently has.\n\nEDIT: Since some people seem reluctant to read the full context of the review;\nThe game itself is good, aside from the shortness of it and the abrupt ending. (the story itself is 6-8 hours, maybe 10 if you collect everything). There is also no after-game content. I'm not saying the game is bad, I'm saying that right now, I cannot justify the cost of it to another user. \n\nThat being said, there are no hardware issues that would cause the bugs mentioned above, the optimization just isn't right. For an idea, I'm running a 1080ti, i7-8700k (5Ghz) and 32GB RAM.  This is totally normal, it's not a massive studio, issues like this were bound to happen. With time i'm sure it'll be fixed, and over in the discussion tab there's a few player-posted work arounds for some issues. If you think this is an issue with my PC, solely for this game, please visit the store discussion page where you will find other users with the same issues, running 20XX series cards and some AMD users. \n\nThings like AI breaking, cut-scenes being goofy or progression being frozen have nothing to do with hardware. These are related to the game itself. There are other bugs currently being looked into by the devs in the discussion section too, such as a certain part of Chapter 7 being literally impossible to do if you encounter a rare bug (no spoilers). \n\nThese issues do NOT effect everyone, but on the chance that you MIGHT be affected, I cannot recommend the game at this moment in time. If it's patched, or goes on sale - it'll be worth it, provided you're aware of the length of the game and accept that (I mentioned this as many people won't be satisfied with 8-10 hours for £40/$45). \n\nBefore complaining this is isolated to my PC, please do some research into the topic as I did, prior to posting this review. \n\nThe game itself was good, but is it currently worth the asking price? In my opinion, no.",Not Recommended

"A Plague Tale is a breath of fresh air during a time when the games market feels like it is stagnating with sequels and remasters. Originality and polish make this a fantastic story focused adventure with very good stealth and puzzle elements thrown in. From the very get go the story keeps the action coming at an excellent pace, making even stealth heavy sections of game play feel like you are always making good progress forward.\nI feel invested in every character that I have met, and am hooked on finding out what the heck is going on. The world is brought to life around you with amazing attention to detail. The smallest of background dialogue or NPC activity makes the world feel very deep, making up for how narrow the world you move through is.\nA masterful soundtrack adds to the atmosphere echoing the emotions of Hugo and Amicia at times, and getting your blood pumping when a hoard of plague rats descends upon you at other times. \nHours into the game immediately after release and I haven't encountered a single bug or glitch. Considering the burning dumpster fires that are most of the pricey games released these days that barely provide functioning code for all the cold hard cash you hand over, it has been a real treat to play an actual working game.\nOverall so far A Plague Tale feels like a labor of love, and I am loving every minute of it.\nI highly recommend this to anyone who is a fan of story or stealth focused games. And for the price, it is well worth checking out.",Recommended

"I do not review games often, however, this game was an exception. While some may find this kind of gameplay boring, it reminds me of the last of us, and taking care of Ellie. It has unique premise, and I think it is worth the 45 dollars.

Similar to Tomb Raider in ways.  You can take multiple approaches to situations as well as craft new items.  So far I've thoroughly enjoyed the game lots of collectibles and after finishing the game I'm very glad to have picked it up.  Another plus it has a good amount of playtime especially if you like to explore.  Would love to see another one.,Recommended
"Almost 2hrs in and I must say the game is amazing so far. Totally worth the $38 I spent. Thank you devs for doing some amazing optimization on the game as well.

The bond between the sister and the brother is unique in it's own way",Recommended
"Heres my review so far.\n\nThis game is definitely NOT for everyone. I do not say it in a bad way, but i know some people will find this type of game boring. I personally gave it a chance and im absolutely loving it. What type of game is it? well, for starters its semi linear, the puzzles are fairly easy, you spend most of your time hiding, running, crafting, interacting and more hiding. This game is very story driven, and i say that seriously. \n\nNow, is it worth $60? HELL TO THE YES. Even though this game may not be for you, i strongly encourage you to support these developers. They did an amazing job, and in my opinion, this is one of the best looking titles of 2019. The acting is Good, visuals (as stated), Story is awesome so far and Hugo (the little boy) is cute as hell/funny and amazingly voiced!!! (same goes for the sister). The story takes place in France during the Medieval Era. A plague has broken out, causing man eating rats to destroy anything in its path and ontop of this, the Inquisition is on the hunt for you and your brother. \n\nI will not spoil anything as you have to play this game. I know it may not be everyones cup of tea, but the devs need recognition for such hard work trying to give us something different in this over saturated gaming market. So with all that..................................................................................PLEASE BUY THIS GAME. \n\nIF ANY DEVS SEE THIS PLEASE CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING BELOW\n\n*What i want to see improved*\n\n-The odd freezing of frames (last for 1 second and pop up randomly, not often, but enough to notice)\n-Mod support for custom outfits (imagine fully plated knight armor?!?!)\n- ULTRA WIDE SUPPORT 3440X1440 21:9\n-ADD NEW DLC STORIES FOR FUTURE\n-MORE HUGO",Recommended

"From what I seen, this game is a absolute gem, It is extremely story driven, a tale of survival, a sister and a brother against the dark forces that are destroying their lives. It is set in around 1348 in France during the hundred years war and the black death, a time of turmoil and all sorts of horrors.\nThe graphics are breathtaking and voice acting is superb, the story is heart-wrenching, and all the while you are saying to yourself ""Please oh please make it out alive...""\nAmicia has her trusty upgrade-able sling she can use to distract enemy solders, knock down objects so they can slip through the swarms of rats, and even smack the men in the face, she also can use alchemic chemicals she finds to do various tasks.\nMost importantly, the game is over all about stealth and puzzle solving in most parts, going guns blazing will only get you killed in most parts.\nSome may be a bit thrown off by Hugo, with how he needs to stay by Amicia's side most of the game and maybe the tantrums he may throw, but as you play the game he very much shows that he is no weakling.\nSomethings in this game a few may find historically inaccurate, and others may complain about the use of more supernatural elements, but It's all about the story, I recommend just focusing on doing your best to keep the characters alive.\nReplay-ability may seem limited, after the story is over the game is pretty much done, but you can use the chapter select to replay levels and find things you didn't pick up before, and you can always replay the game from the start if you desire, seen some people play thought it in about 6 and a half hours with a few saying maybe 15 max per session is about the run-time.\nOverall, gorgeous game, one that I'll be playing though on my own time, both as someone who appreciates a good story game, and a avid rat fan.",Recommended
"A Plague Tale: Innocence is an intriguing stealth game set during the Black Death. Amicia and Hugo lost their home and family and they have to journey together in this ravage world while supporting and relying on each other.\n\nExcuse the minute run time but you'll understand why I had to get this review out ASAP. \n\n[h1] Gameplay [/h1]\n\nThe main body of gameplay is stealth and puzzle solving. You have to rely on Hugo in some heart-beating situations that will render you speechless. Yes, I know. WHY on gods green earth doesn't Amicia have a sword? This is explained in the prologue chapter. And ultimately i think it's serviceable. It's easy stealth and not over-the-top\n\n[h1] Audio & Visuals [/h1]\n\nThe visuals are the most impressive thing that I have ever seen in the year 2019. Truly. Each moment is just beauty struck with incredible detail. The voice acting in this is incredible, and overall it works just as well.\n\n[h1] Story [/h1]\n\nI'm not going to spoil the story. But! I will make mention at the overall growth of Amicia and Hugo as the game progresses onward. You really begin to see a change in tone of Amicia and Hugo. And by the end of it, it's actually perfect. A sort of callback to Naughty Dog's 'The Last Of Us' \n\n[h1] Outro  [/h1]\n\nThere is a reason why I got this review out ASAP. Some might call this a visually impressive stealth game. Nothing more. But! ultimately the story narrative and overall growth of the characters Amicia and Hugo is what captures the price tag. There are some issues in the game, but that can easily be fixed. Overall its a recommended.",Recommended
I've only played through 3 chapters but I love the story so far..\nMy only complaint would be the combat mechanic where you have to dodge and take out pieces of armor off your opponent. It's clunky and I just feel like it takes too long - I'd prefer a more puzzle-like approach.,Recommended
"4 chapters in, will update when I complete the game but wanted to get positive feedback out into the wild right away. While the gameplay is fairly trivial and the roots of this game are in adventure and not action, the story and character interactions are gripping right off the bat and I'm genuinely looking forward to seeing how it all plays out. Also, I find that even though the variety in gameplay isn't crazy or anything, each encounter does feel wholly unique, if a bit linear (though I hope there are a bit more puzzling scenarios in the latter half).",Recommended

"Where do I begin? From the graphics to the story-line, A Plague Tale: Innocence has so far been everything that it lived up to be. I'm already hooked and I'm only 1.4 hours in. The game so far is very stealth oriented, there is no other option of just fighting your way through things if you don't like being stealthy (Think Dishonored). However this adds a lot of realism into the game, so imho this is a plus. Also (not that I know of) there is no difficulty setting, but this is not needed as your not fighting hordes of people, but going through a story. Overall, the game is really good and I do recommend it.",Recommended

The plague has arrived in France. Villages and cities are deserted, the people that have survived are barricaded in their houses, praying that they won't be the next ones burnt on the pyres.  In the midst of the chaos, we follow the journey of Amicia and her little brother Hugo, mysteriously pursued by the Inquisition because of his illness. Robbed of their family, their house and everything they've ever known, Amicia and Hugo will have to go through unimaginable horrors and face the hardest choices yet.\n\n\n[h1] ✅ Pros: [/h1]    \n• Amazing characters, with remarkable personalities\n• Voice acting more than just easy on the ears\n• Fun stealth mechanics\n• Gear upgrades system, allowing for bolder strategies the more you go on\n• Interesting relationship between the siblings\n• Every character that joins you has a trait that makes them unique, and very helpful in the journey\n\n\n[h1] ❎ Cons: [/h1]    \n• A few graphics bugs\n• Supernatural swarms of rats\n• In its uniqueness, the swarms of rats make the whole thing a lot less believable\n• Main characters take a good while to grow on you\n\n\n[h1] 🎮 Gameplay: in depth [/h1]     \n[u][b] General information [/b][/u] \n\nA Plague Tale: Innocence is a wonderfully crafted grim tale. A journey filled with choices that are hard to make, horrors to be seen, and feelings to be taken and shattered in about a billion pieces.\n\nUpon starting a new game we can decide whether to pick a Standard experience or an Immersive one. It's very self-explanatory, but the Standard mode will let you experience the game from a more solely story-driven perspective, while the Immersive one robs you of all those features that in the Standard mode would make you all cozy and lazy. No indicators, no markers, many of the interface elements would be gone, and, most of all, no tips. Ever.\nIt's two very different ways of living A Plague Tale.\n\nA Plague Tale is a story that unfolds in many different chapters, and the more you progress through them, the more grim and dark it gets. The game begins with a very brief tutorial, you'll shoot with your trusty slingshot, you'll sneak through tall grass, hop over obstacles and crouch under them. All of this aided by your father, who apparently is not a man you get to see much. Same goes for your mother, as it's hinted that she's always taking care of your sick brother, Hugo. \n\nOverall, the characters' models are very well done, the animations and facial expressions feel smooth and not too unnatural. That is if it's a scene in which two characters are not actively interacting with each other. It's in those occasions that we can point out some much more faulty and stiff animations, breaking the spell of a natural, smooth exchange.\n\nA Plague Tale has a companion mechanic that we've seen in other games, recent or otherwise (The Last of Us is a pretty close example in this case): Hugo, smaller than you, can crawl or squeeze through very small enclosures and spaces, that would otherwise be an impossible obstacle for you. Other than that, Hugo will always stick close to us unless told otherwise. Mind you, journeying hand in hand with Hugo is a must, he'll not move without you and if left alone for too long he'll start panicking and his cries will attract enemies in the area.\n\nIn general, the game seems to be divided into sections: human stealth, rats' hell, running from either. Once you get accustomed to them, the gameplay per se won't hold many surprises anymore, other than those once-in-a-lifetime situations in which you could, for example, make use of a catapult. Because apparently, a scrawny kid can easily use a catapult.\n\nThe game offers you a gear upgrade system, through the smart usage of workbenches spread throughout the world. Materials can be found pretty much anywhere around you, so long as you look. Often times the game won't punish you for not taking your time exploring an area more thoroughly, but know that the greater the risk, the greater the rewards. \nYou've been warned.\n\nThrough workbenches you can upgrade your sling to make it shoot faster and more accurately, you can also upgrade your gear to make yourself move more silently, or increase the size of your ammunition bag and your pockets.It's all very basic upgrades, but they still allow you to make for bolder strategies. You're armed to the teeth - kind of, except, the game wants you to be stealthy, and I can't stress that enough. The game itself gives you a big no-no Hugo mode whenever you kill someone you REALLY didn't have to kill.\nStay out of unnecessary dangers... And fights.\n\nAt times, the game will have you face situations in which you could potentially decide someone's fate (mostly just NPCs you find along your way). A good 99% of the times there's a way for you to save these people, rather than dooming them. However, it usually comes at the cost of your own resources, which could potentially slow you down instead. It's hard to say who deserves mercy and who doesn't.\n\n[u][b] Content [/b][/u]    \n\nThe game progresses at a steady pace. The chapters are neither too long nor too short, for a total of 17 chapters and about 10 to 15 hours of gameplay. Each chapter has an extensive area annexed to it, full of dangers to survive to, materials to be discovered, pretty flowers to be found for Hugo's happiness. It's overall a short journey, but it showers you with goodies and nice views if you go looking for them.\n\n\n[h1] 🔬 Technical Analysis [/h1]    \n[u][b] Graphics [/b][/u]    \n\nThe graphics are just as good as they were advertised. The characters were made with a great deal of attention to every minuscule detail. The sceneries can be just as breathtakingly beautiful as breathtakingly horrid and grim, and sometimes I'd wished they didn't pay SO much attention to details. But they did, and the end result is absolutely grand.\nThe possible graphics settings choices are Low, Medium and High, only.\n\n[u][b] Music [/b][/u]\n\nSoundtracks must give you that extra adrenaline that makes every gaming experience just that much more worth it, and A Plague Tale delivers that extraordinarily well. Every piece is a crescendo in each and every aspect: it starts out slow, peacefully, with an almost relaxing tune to it. Then all of a sudden it starts picking up, mildly at first, and suddenly bursts in a desperate loud march, spurring you on. \n\n\n[u][b] Bugs Encountered [/b][/u]    \n\nSo far, I've faced eyelids animated of life of their own, disappearing walls and goofy trees. The first one is especially annoying: whenever there's a close up to two characters talking to each other, or just one even, the eyelids will casually separate themselves from their owner's body and start dashing around the screen.\n\n[u][b] Performance [/b][/u]\n\nPlayed on the highest settings on a fairly not-so-new machine, the game runs without as much as the slightest hiccup. There have been no frame drops, nor crashes.\n\n\n[h1] 🎬 Conclusion [/h1]   \nA Plague Tale: Innocence is that one incredible story-driven game that I've never known I always wanted and desired. It's dark and doesn't go for half measures. It's an all in of gore and despair, intertwined perfectly with the fate of two siblings looking out for each other and trying to survive against all odds. It's definitely not for everybody, and not everybody will like it, but for the price of 44,99$, it would be a crime to just scroll past such a hidden gem, without even giving it a chance.\n\n\n[i]This product was reviewed with a key provided for free by the developers.[/i]",Recommended
"A Plague Tale : Innocence wears its heart on its sleeve with this phenomenal narrative experience. Reminiscent of other triple A games like [i]The Last of Us[/i], the player follows the story of Amicia and Hugo de Rune, two siblings who journey across the disease ridden kingdom of France. \n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\nVery-well written and paced, the story mainly follows the intimate relationship between the siblings. The Inquisition endlessly pursues the younger brother for reasons you will learn as you play. Instantly gripping and violently portrayed, I was very attached to the duo and the plethora of characters they meet. The narrative is thought-provoking, complex yet simple to follow, interesting enough to keep you hooked, and most importantly unique and emotional. It holds no punches and constantly surprises you. \n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nYou play as a fourteen year-old girl who needs to hold Hugo's hand. As bland and boring as this sounds, the gameplay differentiates itself by its stealth segments and puzzle-solving mechanics. The stealth asks the player to work in collaboration with the brother to distract and sneak past enemies by using your sling to throw rocks and other various objects around the environment. The puzzle-solving is very dynamic and complex, most of them involving swarms of rats through which you must navigate, the light being your only safe space. The rats themselves are a treat to look at, as they swarm in massive numbers towards you, or slowly retreat away from your torch. There are also chase sequences, boss battles with one on one combat with dodge mechanics, simple and complex puzzle-solving. The gameplay is engaging, constantly changing, and most importantly fun. Keep in mind this is not a combat/fighting game, but its uniqueness and fun factor might surprise you. \n\n[h1]World/Graphics[/h1]\nThe graphics need to be seen to be believed. Its legitimately far better than most triple A games on the market right now. The attention to detail is unbelievable coming from an indie developer, from the pig testicles to the foliage to the weather effects to the animations to the scenery; the game constantly amazes you around every corner. Absolute eye-candy, prepare to take screenshots left and right. It also runs extremely well with every setting maxed out.\n\n[h1]Overall[/h1]\nThere are not many single player games of this quality, and the developers need to be praised for what they have achieved here. Masterpiece all around the board and an instant classic, this game proves the potential of narrative in video games and pushes its boundaries even further. If you are on the fence and enjoy this kind of game, this should be an instant buy, especially at its discounted price. \n\ntl/dr \nGreat story, amazing graphics, fun gameplay, with well designed stealth puzzles and cool rat physics.",Recommended

"The scene of crossing a battlefield, with hundreds of lifeless bodies piled over each other, only to see a swarm of rats bursting out of a horse’s bloated corpse is just one of multiple sights that A Plague Tale: Innocence inevitably etches into your mind.
