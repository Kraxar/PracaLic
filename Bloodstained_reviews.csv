review,recomend
"2D Metroidvania is my favorite videogame genre, hands down. This one is pretty good. As expected, it hits a feverish nostalgic nerve for Castlevania: Symphony of the Night.  The unexpected result of which was that I started to wonder if SotN itself is somewhat over-rated.  This was mostly due to the difficulty imbalance that both games share.  It is too easy to steamroll bosses if you encounter them for the first time with OP gear found elsewhere, which is something that is hard to get right it nonlinear games. However, this games has a few more issues than SotN.  This review is a warning about the shortcomings.\n\nWhile the overall graphic design is pretty slick the zones in this game are extremely generic and their placement within the 'castle' lack rhyme or reason.  They switch between boilerplate garden/lava/sand/ice/library/lab/japanese-shrine environments at the drop of a hat.  I'm not saying Dracula's MC Escher style castle in SotN had a realistic layout or anything, but the design felt much more cohesive. Also, some zones clearly got more development time than others, with the later zones in particular being extremely underwhelming. \n\nFarming.  I don't think there is any point in SotN where you have to farm item drops from monsters but doing so is a core game mechanic in Bloodstained.  The demand is two-fold: It is needed to rank up your shards and you need ingredients to cook meals.  Shards are magic attacks or attribute buffs and each shard levels up separately.  The problem is there are dozens of shards. The end result is I ignored 95% of them completely because I'd get the level one version which would invariably be weaker than the ones I was already using.  If you want to level up a shard, fight the monster you got it from originally, don't expect it to pop up later on a similar monster (bear in mind drop rate in early game is around 5%).\n\nQuests.  The quest system is deeply flawed. Four NPCs give you sequential quests where you have to complete the current quest to unlock the next quest. Two of these NPCs require you give them specific items to complete the quest. I didn't have said items and assumed they'd pop up later in my travels.  Nope.  The problem is many items only drop from one monster type and at very low rates. This is also a problem for cooking in general.  There's an item that a lot of mid-game recipes need (Beast Milk) which is dropped by only one, unremarkable enemy type.  There is exactly ONE of that enemy in the entire castle, unless you know to farm it your recipes will stall and the quests that require cooked items will as well.\n\nAnother example of a stalled quest.  The NPC requested a fire circlet.  I had already discovered a thunder circlet from a chest, so I assumed I'd find a fire one eventually.  Nope, literally nowhere to be found.  You need to buy an otherwise useless circlet from the shop, and then all of a sudden you get the recipe to build the fire circlet.  Why didn't I think of that?  Well, every other recipe you discover in the game shows up in the crafting screen regardless of whether you have all the items to make it.  I try to play games without looking at walk-throughs and it was end-game when I finally caved to find the solution to that one.\n\nOverall I liked the game, just not in stand-out ways I can articulate.  The control is crisp, there are quality of life improvements over SotN, and its a variation of formula I enjoy. I would say that the production quality is fairly high, but lacks polish.  They've done one balance patch already, so maybe it'll continue to improve.  Of the 15 or so metroidvania games I've played this one is squarely in the middle of the pack.",Recommended

"The best Castlevania experience since Order of Ecclessia. This game builds up on the concepts first pioneered on SOTN and built up on the handheld trilogies, especially Aria & Dawn of Sorrow. \n\nOverwhelmingly positive experience overall with this game, never had a single crash or bug in 25 hours of gameplay. Combat is fluid, movement, dodge, action cancel, all feel intuitive and have the same mix of ""easy to pull off, difficult to master"" concept of old. \n\nThe only downside I'd point out is the lack of a proper difficulty curve. Your character quickly outpaces enemies damage and skills, especially given how insanely OP some of the shard powers are (Draconic Rage and Void Ray combo is just insane). By mid-to-late game you just cruise through until the end.",Recommended

"Really a top quality game.  I enjoyed it from start to finish.  My only complaint is that at one part it was nearly impossible to figure out what the next step was and it is the only time the game does not give you hints (by talking to NPCs).  Otherwise, what an awesome game that can be played how you want to a certain degree (ton of customization and options for you to pick your preferred play style).  Highly recommend this!",Recommended
Absolutely AMAZING game.  Truly a great castlevania experience.\n\nEDIT: Just beat the game and I still stand by it's a fucking amazing game.,Recommended
"Overall a solid metroidvania game, although I had my few annoyances with it. If you liked Hollow Knight you will probably like this one as well.\n\nPros:\n-Enemy and environment designs\n-Soundtrack\n-A lot of powers/weapons to use\n\nCons:\n-Game is fairly short, was able to finish it with a 90-ish completion in around 15-18 hours.  \n-Practically no real way to heal except to go to a save room, which sometimes required me to just rush through a game section frantically looking for it\n-The items(including healing) are way too expensive, requiring significant grinds. I've managed to complete the entire game with a Recommended ending and only having earned a total of 25-30k coins, large heals(3rd or so hp) cost 1000, whereas good gear and upgrades(16 or 32 bit coins) are within 10-20k+ range...\n-Save rooms and fast travel rooms were sometimes far apart, requiring a lot of backtracking to get to save.",Recommended

"Unlike Inafune, IGA managed this game well and successfully followed through with the kickstarter campaign to make this game the most authentic successor to the Castlevania series especially SOTN. It's exactly like a blast to the past. Both Hollow Knight and Salt and Sanctuary are meh in comparison.",Recommended
"It's not a bad game, just not for me. My 2nd time trying it and I thought the previous game Bloodstained: curse of the moon was an awesome platformer but this game feels more like dark souls than a platformer and the grinding involved, I just don't want to know about it.",Not Recommended

"This is one of those games that you already need to like in order to like.  \n\nA quick look through the reviews made me realize that this game has a heavy nostalgia factor, as well as familiarity with the franchise's universe, with a dose of kickstarter-investments; combined together these put the game into a different light for those who are already invested in it, versus newcomers like me.\n\nAs someone who's unfamiliar with this universe, the game was simply too clunky and slow, with a lot of backtracking involved.  The story was not interesting and the combat is dull.  I did give it a fair try but eventually lost interest.  With that, can't recommend unless you already know what you're getting into.",Not Recommended
"I KickStarted this game years ago, and I am very pleased with how it came out. It feels just like the classic's the Koji Igarashi is known for, but it's also got a lot of newer content that really helps bring newer life to the game. Character customization, good weapon variation and combat, varied familiars, soundtrack and story are all fantastic. Dialogue can be 'strange' at times, but I found it grew on me quick. I do have two complaints. One: the shard animation needs a 3rd setting, only activating on story specific or rare gathers. I turned it off pretty fast, but I wouldn't mind seeing it for the important shards that are needed to progress or are very powerful. Two: The Aqua Stream shard needs to be either a 100% drop for your first kill, added to shardcontainer, or be much less cryptic. I wandered for about 2 hours before I had to look up that a random mob drop was required to progress. Every minute I enjoy the game more and more though, and would absolutely advise it to those who haven't played yet.",Recommended

Best game dawn of sorrow 2,Recommended
"It's way better than expected. Looks great, plays like the very best Post-Symphony Castlevania games but even richer in features. The map is HUGE. 3 hours in and I've only seen like 17% of it and less than 10% of the monsters I think. So many special moves, ways to customize your play, and just great design. Truly amazing game. The only thing it's missing is the Castlevania name, but I'm hoping that we see more of Bloodstained in the future and it becomes its own franchise.",Recommended
Great game,Recommended
"Like most, I backed this project as a huge IGA-vania fan. I play and replay Symphony of the Night a couple times a year and even break out my DS to play those games too. Bloodstained does a remarkable job of capturing the spirit of those games while still managing to feel fresh and new.\n\nCharacter progression gives you a ton of options and the end goal isn't whether or not you'll be overpowered, but how you'll be overpowered. You may grind a bit to get there but the end result is always worth it. There's no one way to play the game so depending on what drops for you and when, you'll always feel like you're powerful. It definitely fulfills that power fantasy niche. \n\nThe music is catchy and tends to get stuck in my head rather often. Visually, the game ranges from passable to stunning. I'd say the graphics are possibly the weakest link but only in comparison to the quality of everything else.\n\nWhile the game itself is incredibly fun and polished in a lot of ways, the endgame is a bit anemic. I got to the final area and quickly beat the game and it felt a bit like ""...That's it?"" I think this may be something resolved by continued developer support\n\nRegardless, if you have any love for the Castlevania series between Symphony and Eccleisa, there is no excuse for not playing this game.",Recommended

"Great game; there's some very obscure exploration to be done once you near the end-game, don't be afraid to look online.\n\nIt's only fault is that if you've played Symphony of the Night (or any of those Castlevania games) to completion you might find this game too easy. Literally nothing in this game gave me trouble, combat wise.",Recommended

"This game is great, Going to the obvious first, it shows alot of influence of Symphony of the Night and Aria of Sorrows including the familiars and in some of the achievements however it still make a unique experience for me\n\nThe visuals looks really good and the graphics are great too, keeping the 2.5D style during all the game and the areas are distinct between each other so you can remember them easly. For Gameplay, its very good but still have 1 or 2 glitches that need to be fix but they don't break the game too much, the controls are responsive.\n\nI like this game and was nice to complete too, but get ready to grind if you want to 100% but only in some achievements, if you play it casually you can end it without need to be level up too much but that doesn't mean this game is easy either",Recommended
"This game is pretty much a successor to Symphony of the Night, but expands into the things that AoS and later titles did with skills.\nOn top of this there is a proper ""town"" area that where you can get quests to help you progress through the massive list of foods and equipment there is to make in the game.\n\nThe price point is a steal for the level of content that is within. I have supported them by buying the game both on PC and on Switch. Both options are amazing.\n\nMy only gripe would be the lack of monitor selection for the game to load into but a simple launch command in steam fixed that issue. (Feel free to DM me if you need it.)\n\nOther than that the games soundtrack is amazing once more and the game feels and plays like SotN. Worth 60$ if you ask me.",Recommended
"The game is fun, don't get me wrong. it's Recommended to what it's trying to do, and felt like a fun callback to symphony of the night.\n\nThat being said, it's not really as deep as it would imply. the game is relatively short, and a lot of the mechanics kind of felt like they were added just to say they did. I didn't find too much joy in the crafting, and crafting gear instead of finding it took away some of the joy that makes metroidvanias fun. \n\nThey have been hyping all of these free DLCs and new characters to play as, but so far the only DLC is not only small but also wasn't free.\n\nIt's definitely worth playing, but 100% not worth $35. Especially since Hollow Knight is so much cheaper and such a better game.",Not Recommended
Took a break from gaming and wanted to jump back into it but not with your classic long ass JRPG/RPG. This was absolutely breath taking found it honestly fun and didn't take long to finish. Sometimes the classic style games are just what you need!,Recommended
"I'll be honest, I was skeptical, but this game is nothing short of a masterpiece. \n\nEverything great about Symphony of the Night and then some. There are so many references to SOTN it's crazy. The map, mechanics, secrets are the exact same, but polished. I could not recommend a game more than this. 1,000/10",Recommended

"Pros:\n+ Spiritual successor to Castlevania series\n+ Hundreds of different weapons & powers/skills to collect\n+ Enormous world to explore\n+ Main Story\n(+ No microtransactions)\n\nCons:\n- Requires lots of grinding if you want to upgrade powers/skills\n- Shallow and simple side quests\n- No alternative outfits to find and collect\n- I wish it was more difficult\n\n\nDo I recommend:\nDespite its few flaws I definitely recommend this game, especially if you're into old 2D Castlevania type of games. This is probably my 2nd favorite game of this year thus far at the time of writing this (summer 2019).\nSo skip the next AAA extortion game that you intent to buy and support these indie devs instead, because unlike AAA studios indie devs still make games for gamers.\n\nVerdict: 8/10 - I wish there will be sequel.",Recommended
"I am a Castlevania fan. And when I say fan, I mean I have almost every single Castlevania game in my gaming collection. This is such an amazing addition. They have really outdone themselves.\n\nThe only complaint I really have, is that if you use the bunnymophis shard it makes the game stupidly easy. I actually had to get rid of the shard because of how I plowed through every boss. And that's it...my only complaint. 5/5",Recommended
Need moar!,Recommended
My only regret is buying this game on sale. IT IS WORTH EVERY GOD DAMN PENNY.,Recommended
"I hate to say this, but I cannot recommend this game.\n\nAll-in-all it's a real shame. I played Symphony of the Night, Super Metroid, and Hollow Knight, and I was super hyped to play Bloodstained. But for a $40 price tag, this game fell short of those god tier games.\n\nIn summary, without spoiling anything, this game fails on three major points for me:\n- The movement mechanics must be equipped and are clunky, slow, and really not fun to use\n- You must play on the lowest difficulty and this is far too easy, you will facetank almost all content\n- Most boss fights lack any depth or challenge and all together about 3 of the 12+ are interesting\n\nSpoilers ahead. I played on PC with a keyboard/mouse.\n\nFirst, the game has a horrible requirement to ""equip"" some of the movement mechanics before you can use them, and they share slots with other abilities you use on a regular basis. On top of that some movement mechanics require you to use your mouse to aim them, so you can't keep both hands on the keyboard (I use arrow keys for movement and the left-hand side of the keyboard for abilities). This is horrendously clunky and I immediately hated the Reflector Ray, Aqua Stream, and Dimension Shift. Reflector Ray usage means open menu, scroll down to it, equip it, lift my right hand to hold my house, hold right-click, aim it for 2-3 seconds, then confirm with another click and wait 2-3 seconds for animation. Compare this to super dash in Hollow Knight where I hold a key and boom 2 seconds later I'm off. This is a massive step backwards in game design.\n\nOn top of this, too many chests/collectables required one specific movement ability in late-game areas, not in areas you would have to backtrack to (which is a staple of Metroidvania that I love). Being in a late-game area and equipping my Reflector Ray to get a chest feels like the devs are trying really hard to justify their poorly designed movement mechanics. It's also worth mentioning that Dimension Shift is used in a single room in the game, and you still have to equip it and use the clunky mouse aiming. There were also no puzzles at all which required clever use of movement mechanics to get a reward at the end. Given how slow and clunky the movement mechanics are I would have liked to use them in a puzzle context a lot more in this game.\n\nNow, I should mention there IS a hotbar where you can customize loadouts, including equipped abilities, and switch to them by holding TAB, pressing an arrow key and confirming with a button press. I ended up using a custom loadout per movement mechanic so I wouldn't have to go into the menu as much. BUT, the hotbar is bugged and if you had double accessories equipped or changed any part of your loadout, it was really liable to mess up your main loadout. Every time I switch back to my main I'd have to re-equip my accessories and double-check the right abilities are being used. It was also non-obvious how to make my current loadout the default for other loadouts, with specific overrides. Poorly implemented band-aid to simply not putting movement abilities on key presses directly.\n\nSecond, the game forces you to play on lowest difficulty during your first playthrough. This only irritates me because the game became braindead easy after the Zangetsu fight (the second boss in the game). Up to the Zangetsu fight the game has its challenges and the Zangetsu boss fight itself was pretty tough for me, I died about 8 times learning it. However, immediately afterwards I acquired Welcome Company, Riga Dohin, and Rhava Bural and shredded through the rest of the content super easily. I was really disappointed that I never had to switch up my loadout and beat all bosses easily on the first try by standing in front of them and unloading. The game really had no interesting gameplay to offer after Zangetsu and that's just unacceptable to me, there should have been mounting challenge over time. I really wish the game had let me play on a higher difficulty.\n\nThird, as I already touched on the bosses are really uninteresting. Zangetsu was awesome and gave me high hopes for the rest of the game, and Bloodless and Alfred did not disappoint for challenge and putting on a show. But the rest of the bosses in the game were really boring, easy, and unmemorable. A couple of flashy bosses like Twin Dragon and Bael were interesting to look at, but packed zero challenge. The final fight was extremely anticlimactic.\n\nTo be clear, the game looks good, performs pretty well (a few frame drops with Welcome Company and Familiar: Dullahammer Head maxed), and is highly polished, but the fundamental game design choices break it.",Not Recommended
"Disclaimer: I received this product for free after backing the game on Kickstarter, even if I regrettably did it as a slacker backer.\nAlright, having played nearly 150 hours of this game since it came out, I think it's high time I wrote a review about this game.\n\nOVERALL THOUGHTS (aka. the tl:dr section):\n-Beautifully crafted game despite initial and current bugs that are being patched\n-Encompassing of multiple playstyles despite the overlying Metroidvania genre, which call back to traditional Castlevania controls\n-Very fair difficulties; it provides multiple settings that accommodate both new and veteran players\n-It set out with a mission and multiple stretch goals, courtesy of Kickstarter, and met requested standards, with the promise of additional content\n-Soundtrack that is out of this world\n-Story, while not as detailed compared to games like Bioshock and To the Moon, hearkens back to traditional Castlevania plots and even adds unique spins (more on this later)\n\nGAMEPLAY:\nThere are so many ways that people can play this game and you quickly start to realize how many ways you can plow through this game. I stuck to my traditional approach to these sorts of titles aka. ""pick a melee weapon of choice and use it on everything until finding something better"", but with progression and repeat playthroughs, I began to experiment with various fighting styles. For instance, with the right items and levels, your new game plus run can consist of infinite shard spamming or using exclusively techniques to wipe enemies to the floor. Alternatively, you can focus on using firearms and crafting many types of bullets to combat various enemies. Some would argue that this game doesn't do much in terms of new playstyle and while I can agree to that to a degree, I feel it's important to remember that Bloodstained is a reminder to what made Castlevania games fantastic and shouldn't feel the need to branch out from traditional forms that consistently worked. However, if there is a Bloodstained 2 (which I would be hyped about), then it would be a good idea to try and experiment.\nSpeaking of crafting, the crafting system in this game rewards you more than expected. Not only can you craft consumables to keep Miriam alive longer as she explores the castle, but you can also craft armor and weapons that boost your stats. This by itself isn't anything unique until you add shard level mechanics. I was surprised to see how the items I craft are also important to upgrading shards, some even requiring weapons and armor to reach higher levels. It is also worth mentioning that the meals that Miriam cooks boost her stats... permanently. A quarter of the way into my first run, I failed to realize how imperative meals were to improving Miriam's abilities and frequently died because I'm too stubborn to abuse consumables (I'm the kind of person that tries to abstain from using healing items even when I clearly need it). Even after learning this, the bosses and enemies still pose a threat if you play carelessly.\nOn the subject of enemies, from what I know of Castlevania titles, there is often a huge conglomeration of foes and this game is no exception to this rule. Based on how they attack, you need to exercise caution lest you discover that half of your health bar gets whittled down before you know it (personal note: screw Cyhyraeths). While there is no one way to take down enemies, you'll find that varying your style may be needed to efficiently farm them for shards and items. What's more interesting is that if you look up some of these enemies (particularly bosses), they tie back to actual figures from mythology, much like various Castlevania titles stuck to. Even the final boss's design is Recommended to mythological depictions (seriously, look it up; the resemblance is near uncanny).\nThe difficulty is what I would consider fair. While I've watched some Castlevania walkthroughs, I never actually played a Castlevania/Metroidvania game (the closest I've came to was minor online flash games and Metroid Prime series). With regards to Bloodstained, I definitely started the game on normal difficulty given my somewhat unfamiliar approach to this game (not that this is anything unusual for anyone, short of knowing the ""Nightmare"" cheat to unlock all difficulties) and I died a fair amount to bosses. As I became more acquainted with the game, I found myself dying less and familiarizing myself with enemy patterns. While there are some parts of exploration that I found tedious (such as finding a certain shard to navigate through the Forbidden Underground Waterway), I never felt bored trying to 100% the game. Even on new game plus runs, I had a ball of a time trying to no damage bosses for bragging rights or starting a fresh Hard run that presented more enemies in certain areas as well as different enemy attacks. Right now, I'm trying to do a fresh Nightmare run which, to its credit, is a nightmare to accomplish. I probably died 15+ times to the first boss and still haven't gotten around to beating it.\nThere are a number of bugs that hasn't been patched yet, though thankfully nothing game-breaking that I stumbled on so far. The most aggravating one in my opinion is how whenever Miriam talks, her speech is slowed down compared to everyone else's with the background music slowing as she talks. At first, I thought it was just my computer doing that since I brought this laptop mid-way through high school and I've now graduated from college for 2 years (aka. it's old), but I found that other characters like Johannes and Gebel having a normal speech speed. What's more is that I checked forums and saw others with the same problem, although not everyone has the same issues I had judging from various videos on Youtube. Other common ones I noticed are character dialogue not matching the written text or sometimes certain words being omitted as well as items getting stuck in walls and ceilings. Thankfully, these don't significantly detract from the game, albeit somewhat annoying at most. Furthermore, subsequent patches do make an effort to fix these problems. To wrap this up, for others who may feel deterred from this game because of the glitches, remember that this is, despite the beauty of the game, considered an indie game. Since Konami is a miserable pile of pachinko machines (there, I said it), Iga-san had to produce this game with less access to resources that triple AAA titles would otherwise have. It is impressive in its own right that the game turned out as great as it did, but I wouldn't be shocked at the few bugs this game has and even so, they don't take much away from the game itself.\n\nMUSIC and ENVIRONMENT:\nSince my computer is literally a potato even when all settings were lowered to as low as I could make it, I wish I could comment more on the setting of Bloodstained without the overall lag that my computer can't keep up with. That said, the visuals are absolutely stunning even with low quality and add to the setting of all the stages. As a 2.5-D game, there is only so much you can do in a certain plane, but the developers really put an effort into crafting the levels. A good example is half of the stage in the Tower of Twin Dragons or most of Bridge of Evil. Just casually glancing at the background of Dian Cecht Cathedral, Livre Ex Machina, and the Hall of Termination is also a treat for the eyes. It's a noticeable enough difference that imagining the game without the environmental art would seriously impact my feelings towards Bloodstained. It's just that good.\nFor the music however, my ears were rejoicing with many of the tunes played through Bloodstained. As someone with a significant musical background, few things are important to me as the ambiance established by the compositions, regardless if they can be played on their own or within the setting of the game in question. The prequel, Curse of the Moon, blew me away with stage music (Stage 1, 5 and 7 being my favorites) and... (see comments)",Recommended
"Literally a post-SotN Castlevania game, and completely unapologetic to the point it throws some references of the original IP. By just renaming characters and enemies, fans can keep enjoying the franchise under a new brand as keeps everything they love about it. If you played a metroidvania before, this is a very solid pick of the genre which only major flaw is minor graphical glitches (Mainly some enemies after being killed and hair physics). There's some item grinding as well, but is manageable as you gradually build your character. There's really nothing much to say, as is pure Castlevania action with a new coat of paint.",Recommended

Hard modes provide a very good challenge especially if you wanna get the medals and beat every boss no damage.

I thought I wasn't gonna be able to run this game (i7 processor, 8gb RAM, Nvidia GT 525m) but it barely worked. It just doesn't run at 100% speed (except the hidden 8 bit dungeon) but I couldn't complain, as other than some input screwiness doing the techniques on a controller everything works fine and is responsive.",Recommended

"It's.........good, really good.",Recommended
"I guess I played this game a little, so here's my first Steam review ever.\n\nIf J.J. Abrams was hired to make a [i]Symphony of the Night[/i] sequel, this is what you would get.  [i]Bloodstained[/i] is flashier than its predecessor, and is a wholly satisfying adventure on its own, but it hits all the same notes as its predecessor in incredibly predictable ways (especially looking at you, [spoiler]sword familiar found in a stained glass-filled cathedral level that becomes a weapon when you fully level it[/spoiler]), the music isn't as good (even though the same composer was involved) and our hero just doesn't move as nimbly as her predecessor (weird back dash lag).  It's not the lightning in the bottle that [i]Symphony[/i] was, but it's still a great game, and highly recommended for anyone who enjoys games in this genre.\n\nAs someone who almost exclusively plays Japanese games with Japanese audio (if the option exists), I also wanted to add that the English voice acting in this game is surprisingly solid.  Yes, some of the midlevel bosses still sound like accounting department fill-ins ([spoiler]Bloodless[/spoiler] was especially painful), but for the most part the English performers are entertaining and just the right level of campy.  During my second and third playthroughs I switched exclusively to English.\n\nFinal thoughts: this game gets broken in some really ridiculous ways if you outlevel the content.  Some of the shards are incredibly overpowered at high levels, to the point that you can ignore nightmare mode boss mechanics entirely and just nuke them in under 20 seconds.  For me, that's fun, but it might not be everybody's cup of tea.\n\nP.S. I was not a kickstarter backer and did not purchase the additional ""Iga's Back Pack"" DLC, so this review does not include an assessment of that content.  The Back Pack DLC was supposed to be a backer-exclusive reward for supporting the game early (at a price point $20 higher than retail), but was later made available as a $10 purchase.  I don't agree with that.  Exclusives should remain exclusive, period.",Recommended
"Aight babes, I've put 90 hours into this game, maxed out all the achievements, beat it twice and if these facts still don't convince you I'm fkin serious just take a look at my profile pic\nBefore I start let me say I've never really delved into any castlevania/metroid/metroidvania game before. I know people who think castlevania isn't a metroidvania, I know people who think metroid is a bad metroidvania, I don't give a damn about plotting a niche with some weird ass nomenclature for this or any other game. Oh yeah, actually I tried Hollow Knight once but it didn't appeal to me for some reason, maybe I picked the game in the wrong time, idk, now to the actual review;\nBloodstained is a fun as hell game.\nNow, please understand me, this might turn out to be a long review, since tearing this game into tiny bits and describing everything about it is just as satisfying as playing it.\n\nSo the game (a 2D sidescroller btw) is basically about a girl who absorbs demon powers and has to explore a big ass castle to acquire ass kicking abilites and beat the living crap out of the final boss, Harry Potter the Prime Evil.\nAlright, so the first thing that turns me on is the game’s artistic embrace, I mean the story+graphics+sound combination. To start with, hell yeah, the story is predictable and cheesy in every possible way, but the other two components together make such good use of that fact that the whole vision turns into your favourite juicy burger with some extra bacon slices. Graphically it's really appealing, charming and eye-catching, it made me stop zooming through the castle to take a deep breath and admire the details so many times I lost count after around 69. The audio side is equally amazing, it's the only video game soundtrack I like to listen to outside of the game that is neither boring nor causes me a headache. The audio themes suit locations very well and help the background to narrate and build up the atmosphere. The tracks are so uncanny I'd gladly write a separate review for them, since they're suitable for both causal playing 'somewhere in the background' and attentive, observant listening.\nThe final component for the triumph of Bloodstained's artistry is the way it estabilishes atmosphere with solutions on the lore side. Every demon you encounter has a little bit of personality attached. All rooms tell stories, some major, some minor, with visual themes guiding them (there are cathedral rooms, desert rooms, asian forest rooms, McDonald’s parking lot rooms, etc.) and enemies fitting the determinants set up by the narrative. It never feels empty or out of touch. There's always something you’ll gain from clearing the same room, a new shard, a resource, a part of equipment. There's always something that will surprise you: a giant demon-cat with horns casting fire storms; a pumped up knight throwing a monster at you that looks like a lion's head with goat legs attached. It's lively, jampacked with rewarding subtleties and tempting to be explored. And this magical feeling never abandons you in your mad adventure.\nGameplay-wise, it's very simple, but despite the humble paradigm of combat/exploration elements, it still manages to create some impressive space for experimenting and playing around. You can have up to 5 skills active, one of each type;\n-a conjure skill, activated with one press of a button (e.g. 'Death Cry', that summons some edgy medieval emo princess screaming at your enemies, dealing damage in an area);\n-a directional skill, that allows you to cast a directed ability (like 'Directed Shield');\n-a 'manipulative' skill (these are the most interesting ones, for example 'Bunnymorphis' turns you into a hot steamy sexual bunny girl that literally kicks ass);\n-a familiar skill that summons a demon follower to help you out;\n-a passive skill that, well, passively grants you enhanced stats or effects\nThroughout the game you will also be able to receive a functional shard, like double jump. Every single shard is acquirable either from the environment or from one of over 100 different enemies you'll encounter. Some shards are craftable. You can upgrade them and change mid-combat. I've put 20 hours into only experimenting with every single one of them and, despite a couple singular exceptions, a grand majority of them is usable. Some are situational, some will define your playstyle, all have strengths and weaknesses. My only complaint is some skill shards that are harder to obtain lack a punch or are ridiculously costly in your mana pool (a good example would be the skill shard you get from the first boss that suffers from both issues).\nAnother big part of the gameplay is your inventory: equipment, which is weapons and gear; food that will grant you bonuses; crafting materials and recipes; usable items, like potions, waystones, or antidotes. There are many types of weapons, including swords, whips and guns, and every weapon is viable through the whole game. You’ll find some of the cool items doing dull quests that are fill-ins for an actual cool mechanic of side activites that the game needs.\n\nThe combat itself is quite deep for its prosaic envelope: enemies have at least a couple weirdo moves that you’ll have to learn to minimize the risk of dying or losing a chunk of your HP. Then, there’s the part your technique plays – you’re gonna want to learn that atk -> backstep -> attack -> special atk combo to pull the most out of your weapon. You’re gonna want to find and learn special moves of your weapons. This, together with the shards system and your inventory highlights the game’s sandboxy manner of handling builds and sets that you can also change in the middle of combat. Yes, you can have, say, a caster set equipped and swap it into a katana kombat (get it?) set and it takes like 0,5 seconds.\n\nDespite the great gameplay design, difficulty settings struggle to keep up with a progressing player. The problem is, on normal and hard difficulty, if you grind enough, you can out-level pretty much any enemy in the game. Gotta say I struggled with normal mode at first, but on my 2nd run I picked up hard mode. It was hard for like 5-7 hours and then it kinda played itself. Nightmare mode is a different story. It’s cruel. Many of the working tricks to make the nightmare mode easier were patched. I’m doing my 4th run on nightmare and the first stage left me sweating bullets. It’s not incredibly frustrating (as for now), but it’s very challenging and demanding. It will kick your ass. Also, bosses receive new moves, starting from hard mode.\n\nNow, the final and probably most important thing, is the length and replayability. If you only want to pick the game up and beat it once, it’s a 15, maybe 20 hours long game. If you’re the type of guy to max out a game completely, the game is 40-50 hours long. If you’re nefarious and love to experiment, it adds 5-10 hours (it added 20 to me but I’m especially wicked, I mean look at my profile pic again). If you’re a madman wanting to master a game and tame it’s wild mechanics on the hardest difficulty, or a speedruner, boy, this is gonna take at least a hundred hours to completely master the game.\n\nEvery time I finished the game I was like ‘man, I wonder how it would feel to play the game with a different approach’. The first run I was wielding a katana and maxed melee combat, the second I mainly focused on magic and that’s how I beat the final boss. You are free to do whatever you want.\n\nTo cut the long story short, Bloodstained is a great game. It’s the best game I’ve played this year and I can see myself playing it much more. Every minor thing you do comes with so much satisfaction and the attention to detail and soul put into making every aspect of this thing is astounding. I still have the nightmare difficulty to beat and I’m always enthusiastic turning this game on, which is why I give this game a score of over 9000/10 and give it my ‘the Big Fish In This Sea’ award. Good job, Igarashi, you did it again, baby.",Recommended

"TLDR: It's a castlevania SOTN clone, but not as good as the first. That said, it's still pretty good.\n\nGood:\nIt has the side scrolling action of SOTN basically copied down to almost the last detail. The environments really look like more of a reboot of SOTN than it's own game. There's even a cave system with waterfalls below the castle.\n\nGreat:\n... IDK what's great here. they didn't screw up the core gameplay too badly\n\nBad:\nIt can seem like you're playing a worse version of SOTN than before.\n-it's a little slow for my liking\n-the enemies are a bit repetitive by comparison to SOTN (yes if you make a SOTN clone everything gets compared)\n-the regular baddies are easy to defeat and the game doesn't challange you until the boss fight\n-fetch quests\n-kill x number of y monsters quests\n-some of the bosses/monsters are plain silly, (like a giant magic house cat - it could be funny but it didn't deliver it that way) or a stained glass window hand thingy.\n-the music seems also like a slightly worse copy of SOTN's tracks. SOTN had brilliant tracks, so no living up to that isn't terrible unless you obviously made a clone.\n\nThe Ugly:\n-WTF is a J-Pop star the protagonist? I've met women who can fight, and no reasonable one would expose so much skin while doing it. But that's not even the worst - she does j-pop moves when you control her and move her around the map\n-the characters, story, and writing. Admittedly it was pretty weak in SOTN, but it's markedly worse here\n\nIn conclusion:\nNot the worst, but it is making me miss the good old days of metroidvania titles. I'd rather download an SOTN ROM and play it again instead of playing this one, but I might finish it now that I'm pot committed.",Not Recommended
"TL;DR it's an amazing game with a fantastic soundtrack.\n\nThe game plays very much like the other Metroidvenia games with an ever expanding map, abilities, and bosses to fight. Combat is handled very well with plenty of weapons to pick from. The map is massive requiring plenty of exploration to 100% it. Boss fights feel very satisfying to beat with just the right amount of challenge. The art is absolutely stunning as well; highly detailed areas, enemies, and items. The game's soundtrack is also very well done; a perfect background to the amazing world of Bloodstained.",Recommended
"Okay so a little bit of backstory before I go on to the game. I was in my teenage years I think, and I really wanted to try out Symphony of the Night after hearing the critical acclaim in many videos. So, I eventually got my hands on a copy and played it. I thought it was alright, only alright because I kept getting lost very early on. Back in those days I wasn't as patient as I am now, and quit.\n\nFastforward a few years, and here I am, interested in Ritual of the Night after playing Curse of the Moon (which is fantastic btw and only 10€, highly recommend) After being gifted this game by my best friend I started playing. I thought the gameplay was a bit simplistic in the beginning, but everything else was already starting to get me hooked on playing more and more. So many new weapons, spells and areas constantly getting thrown at me. Slowly yet surely, I noticed time was speeding by like a bullet train. Playing for 30 minutes quickly became a couple hours, which then quickly became full days of me just playing as Miriam, exploring every nook and cranny of this massive castle. \n\nThe game is a Metroidvania, obviously, and when I, who was skeptical of the Metroidvania genre (I already told you my experiences of Symphony of the Night, but also I  haven't enjoyed Metroid all too much in the past either) tell you that this game is really fun and addicting, I think it's safe to assume this is a great Metroidvania to jump into. The game imo has a very gentle difficulty curve. The game can be challenging, but only brutally so if you choose to play on harder difficulties, or if you limit yourself in terms of equipment/healing items. It's not baby easy don't worry, and even if you're really good at the game, it's just satisfying demolishing everything in your path with Miriam, a character with so much diversity, it's almost absurd. \n\nThere are some parts of the game where I got lost and had no idea where to go, so let me give you guys a tip if you are going to pick this game up, When you get to a place where you cannot proceed or get an item, mark it on your map! \nTrust me, the map is your best friend in this game. \nThanks to the marker system, I was able to beat the game without looking up anything on the internet. The game does a (mostly) fantastic job of guiding you where to go next if you look at the map and pay attention to your surroundings.\n\nAs for you hardcore game folk, the game has higher difficulties, as well as a Boss Rush and Speed Run mode (unfortunately the Speedrun mode doesn't disable cutscenes, so be sure to spam the ever living fuck out of the start button a lot.)\nThe game also has a few movement techniques that the game doesn't tell you about, but are really fun to discover by yourself. They aren't required to beat the game however.\n\nSo, in conclusion, I can highly recommend this game for, well, basically anyone if you think you're interested! The map is well designed (although if I had to nitpick, I wish the areas were color coded to signify it was a different area, but I understand they wanted to keep it traditional and not make the map a rainbow, but I digress) Miriam is a joy to control, the story isn't going to win any awards but it serves it's purpose well! \n\nIf you're a fan of the original Symphony of the Night however...\nYou NEED to play this game. I know coming from me, someone who hasn't even come close to finishing it doesn't hold much water, but you just...\nJUST PLAY IT. \n\n\nalso the game has many refrences to a certain popular anime series...\nI'm sure you'll know them when you see them.\n\nEDIT: Although Bloodstained: Curse of the Moon is called a ""prequel,"" it is NOT canon. So you do not need to play Curse of the Moon to understand Ritual of the Night.",Recommended
"I played castlevania symphony of the night, rogue legacy, ori, salt and sanctuary and many other metro games. \nThis was the worst balancing-wise:\nx normal monsters are 1-2 shots maximum,\nx bosses...they go down so fast on normal and hard that u cant even see their whole move-set.\n\nThe soundtrack is very repetitive and is annoying at times. \n\nIf you are not interested in a balanced game and want rather an Im n op champ who destroys everything experience. If you like metro games and the castlevania saga. If you are casual and say ""hey, this is a single player game, who the fuck cares bout balancing""...go for it.\n\nThis game has nice graphics, cool moves and...well that´s it...\n\nAlot of dlc are still expected and a balancing patch came out (it mostly lowered early game dmg of spells, which is bs since magic scales so hard and mana usage is too low so you can still magic spam every boss to death)...so maybe this game will get better and wont stay a one button win game.\n\nIf you played this and think my review is bs...then ur just a rly bad gamer, because no real fan of metro games likes it to be too easy.",Not Recommended

"This is more of a neutral rating. It starts off strong and is very good until about halfway through the game. Once you start working your way towards the Recommended ending, that's when the game gets weird. If you liked Symphony of Nights really really [i]really[/i] lot then you'll get your fill with this! I had far more fun playing Touhou Luna Nights though, which is a very similar fan made game, just shorter. I'd recommend that instead of this, if you haven't played it already.\n\nAt times this game is the prime example of how not to do 3D graphics on a 2D playing field, with the Recommended ending final boss being the worst offender. The hitboxes are all over the place, important information, such as incoming enemy spells, are often obscured by the big enemy models (honestly, I don't understand why the spell animations aren't just ""always on top""). To give you an example of how bad the hitboxes are, I've had cases where I already bumped into the enemy and took damage, yet my wide katana slash didn't register as a hit (happens with Recommended final boss almost all the time).\n\nHowever, the places where this game does excel are level design and spells and the combat system. The map is very big, complex and the environments are pretty nice after the overhaul. You always acquire a lot of new movement skills to access new areas throughout the game to unlock new stuff. It uses the extra dimension in 3D in a very smart and nice way here, as you're climbing up a spiraling tower!\n\nThere's a lot of spells and a lot of them look and feel amazing (Riga Storæma being my absolute favorite). It's just a shame there's no skillful way to regenerate mana, as it gets very scarce towards the end of the game, so a full-on mage build is not really viable. Plus, your weapon skills also use mana and those are lot stronger than spells towards the end of the game. Speaking of weapon skills, most weapon have them and you activate them the same way you do special moves in fighting games, like street fighter for example. The input is correctly recognized like 95% of the time, although there are some moves which will be difficult to pull of because they share key inputs with other moves.\n\nThe story is... well, predictable. You do have to pay attention to what the characters and the lore books say though, if you want to get the Recommended ending without following a walkthrough. English voice acting is pretty bad though. I recommend switching to Japanese with English subs.",Recommended
"This is probably in the top 3 castlyvania games ever made, its pretty much everything that makes the more equipment focused castyvania games good with all of the fat cut out. The game controls lightning fast, has a great world design with a ton of options for how to play and where to go. It got stuck once or twice on me forcing a restart (and a loss of a little progress), but the levels have a fun enough run that I never minded doing it again. Great music, huge combat versatility, cant wait for the free extra characters so I can beat it again.",Recommended
"An absolutely stellar metroidvania. I'm only part way through it, but already I can tell that it takes the best of previous Igarashi titles and packs it altogether in one great experience.\n\nAdmittedly, the experience starts slow and feels simple, but you have to give it chance. Keep playing past the first boss and the game starts to open up. Very quickly, you will come to realize that this is more than just a pretty, cell-shaded, 3d modeled castlevania. I don't want to give too much away, but there are NPCs, and quests, and the usual souls and gear chasing, along with a number of other added mechanics.\n\nIt's so refreshingly deep. I look forward to 100%ing it.\n\nUPDATE: So I've finished the title completely. I really enjoyed my time with this game. My previous review still stands. The only slight I can give the game is that it loses the pixel charm from Symphony of the night. Otherwise, it's arguably the best Castlevania title to date.",Recommended

"After Koji Igarashi's departure from Konami in 2014, many wondered if the famed [b]Castlevania[/b] mastermind would continue his work in the genre.  With Igarashi free to do his choosing as an independent developer, a Kickstarter for the first post-Konami title was made.  With over $5.5 million funded, the wheels to [b]Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night[/b] started churning.  After nearly 4 years of planning, developing, and building, the tale of Miriam and her quest to rid the world of the plague of demons is finally upon us.\n\nSet in 18th Century England, the followers of Alchemy were seeing their relevancy quickly dissipate through the technological advances of the Industrial Revolution.  Seeing society move forward with the advances of the future, The Guild of Alchemy found a way to summon demons and show that Alchemy was still a need in the world.  In order to bring these demons to their realm, Crystals charged with demonic powers were forcibly infused to humans and then sacrificed to complete the rituals to bring the demons to their world.  What was meant to show the need for Alchemy became a horrendous massacre that wiped out not only most of the Guild, but most of England as well.  Through the chaos, only two humans infused with crystals, known as Shardbinders, lived: a man named Gebel, and a woman cast under a mysterious sleeping state named Miriam.  After ten years of slumber, Miriam wakes to Gebel bringing the demons back into England to rid the rest of the Alchemy Guild, and it's up to Miriam to help the Church in saving England once again.\n\n[b]Bloodstained[/b] was an interesting product for myself, given I've never played any [b]Castlevania[/b] games in my life.  So any running comparisons are lost on me.  That being said, I can understand why people favor the style of game so much.  Right from the get go, I loved the flow of combat, especially the diverse amount of weaponry that really allows you to tinker your favorite style to your liking.  With Miriam being a Shardbinder, she is able to pull Shards from the demons she defeats, using their powers to help slay her foes.  The amount of different types of magic is staggering, bolstering an already impressive amount of depth with even more freedom.  The castle's many areas are filled to the brim with detail, with each new section of the castle having its own personality and being super fun to navigate.  The castle's lore is scattered throughout bookcases that dive further into its history.  These bookshelves also have books storing special combos for each weapon type: ranging from supersonic throws with your daggers, to countering attacks with your katana, and much more.\n\nThough I did have a ton of fun with [b]Bloodstained[/b], it does carry some faults.  While the game starts out with a heavy handed, but difficult tutorial: [b]Bloodstained[/b] feels a little too easy when venturing the castle.  Throughout the game, I only died once to common enemies.  Though this qualm can be easily fixed with the harder difficulties available after you complete the game, [b]Bloodstained[/b]'s real test come through the bosses that are littered throughout the castle.  There are a decent handful of main bosses that are such a treat to face, with each boss bringing a new style and challenge to the battlefield.  The boss fights are easily the most enjoyable facet of the game, with the later bosses and optional bosses easily humbling you, which makes the Boss Rush Mode that much better when you unlock it.  One other issue I found is it's really easy to get stuck wondering where to go next.  [b]Bloodstained[/b] plays with a breath of non-linearity, and will require a bit of circling and backtracking about the castle.  Though there are teleportation rooms scattered throughout, it is possible to fight some bosses out of order, or miss them completely if you aren't careful or looking to run the Recommended Ending.  Acquiring all the steps necessary to receive the Recommended Ending can feel like a ridiculous scavenger hunt that you'll most likely stumble into, if not eventually reaching for a walk through.\n\nBut all of that pales in comparison to the blast of a time I had with [b]Bloodstained[/b]. The bevy of content out now will have you pumping hours into unlocking everything that is in store; but the amount of free DLC down the pipeline: online co-op, versus mode, speedrun mode, and much more, give [b]Bloodstained[/b] a glowing future to look forward to.  The astonishing amount of customization within fighting styles, topped with gratifying bosses, complete the package of this game being just plain fun.  [b]Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night[/b] is an easy recommendation now, and will be even more so in the future.\n\n[quote][h1]Follow [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/33247611/]A Review Is Worth 1,000 Words[/url] for more content.[/h1][/quote]",Recommended

"This was a game where the criticism almost pushed me away from the game at launch, but I'm glad I stuck it out as this has become one of, if not my favourite Metroidvania type game.\n\nThe story isn't too deep, some twists and turns pop up and is pretty simple to follow; however, it's in no means a bad story. I just don't feel that's exactly the focus of the game as it's not some RPG that is story based where you can log upwards of 40 hours from dialogue alone. Instead I feel the game shines the most in it's mechanics, OST, and nostalgia, be it you played the original Bloodstained or if you make a comparison to the Castlevania series.\n\n\n[h1]Controls[/h1]\n\nThe controls were absolutely fluid for me in a lot of ways and I was able to even abuse the way the mechanics work to get faster movement before you get any real movement speed increases. I didn't really have any problem with jumping between platforms, attacking whilst jumping or quickly attacking in a different direction. I did have trouble with some combos, but I also struggle with getting corner inputs on any controller that's not a GameCube controller (smash life...)\n\n[h1]Graphics[/h1]\n\nHands down one of the absolute most appealing Metroidvania titles out there. The different scenery throughout the castle and the little details in certain areas like the library for example are perfect. Character models are also pleasing to the eye. Effects in the game at times can become a lot depending on what you're doing with attacks, shards and what the enemy is doing but it's handled well enough where it's not overbearing. I can't tell if the graphics are hand drawn or not, it's kind of in that mixed area of look for me. Colours that are supposed to be vibrant are vibrant for the most part and colours that are supposed to be dark, gritty, match up pretty well.\n\n[h1]Soundtrack[/h1]\n\nFantastic soundtrack, seriously. The first area of the game kicks you off with a banger. I know the dev(?) doesn't like being compared to Castlevania too much but I heard plenty of scores that reminded me of Castlevania music and that made it so much better to me. The title theme even has it's own little easter egg music later in the game that is all piano and can be piano with lyrics which is a solid piece of music.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\n\nGameplay is kind of a mix with things. There are definitely some cons, some of which I know got patched out, but I'll be leaving those for the cons section coming up. Before that, the gameplay was solid for 9/10 times, minus a few things here and there. Exploration was great and I only had one instance of where I got lost. The map is a great size for people who like to explore and there's plenty of enemies to get new shards. There is a plentiful amount of weapons, with some being overshadowed by others, but nonetheless, there is a lot of variety to it. \n\n[h1]Cons[/h1]\n\n- Shards. There are a fair amount of shards in this game which act as your magic/spells and others are passive abilities to help you get further such as double jumping, while others give an effect for say more defense. The problem is/was, some shards are simply pointless in most ways or get completely overshadowed by other shards. There were shards that would let you run through the game without having to worry about managing your health or playing on the defense. This might not be a problem to some people, but to others it may take the fun out of the game when you're rewarded for using those and either punished or dragging out boss fights for using other shards.\n\n- Weapons. As I said earlier, some weapons are simply outclassed by others and this couldn't be more truthful. For a Metroidvania type game, you would expect to be able to run around and dish out consistent damage without feeling so sluggish right? That's Recommended for some weapons; however, others put you at a clear disadvantage against some enemies. Some weapons are just so slow that you need to have near it's maximum range spacing just so you have time to start the attack animation, hit, then run away and repeat, where as others you can run in and get multiple hits in and either kill the enemy or space yourself out of their attack range to run back in.\n\n- Combos for the most part don't feel worth the risk. They use up MP, are for the most part slow and don't deal nearly as much damage as you would hope. I did find myself rather just spamming the attack button for physical moves instead of really going for combos.\n\n- Aegis Plate. Okay, this one made me feel so damn stupid. This is a piece of armour that lets you traverse traps without taking damage and is needed to get to a new area. The problem is, you can't obtain it until getting a certain power and even then, it's not mentioned where to go for this and it's in a rather odd spot that you really wouldn't check. This is what was preventing me from moving forward and I ended up buying a bunch of potions and food and running through the spike trap and just tanking what I could to cut through. I am not the only one who had this issue and it made me feel a little less stupid that I wasn't the only one with this issue.\n\n- A bug that can get you stuck in water. This might have been me just breaking the game with my movement speed ""glitch"" I was doing, but multiple times when I went into water doing it or at times attacking before I had a Shard to let you float down, I would get ""stuck"" in the water. I was able to move around, but I couldn't jump or attack. If there was a slope/hill I could just walk onto, I would be fine; however, if there wasn't one, I was virtually stuck there and had to use a Waystone to get back to the home base. If I didn't have a Waystone, I would have been stuck there and had to lose my save area. I'm hoping this has been patched, but again, it simply could have just been me abusing a movement increase I found out myself from and caused the issue.\n\n[h1]Summary[/h1]\n\n- Fantastic OST and one of the better soundtracks I've heard in not only Metroidvania type games, but games in general\n\n- Very fluid controls. Responsive, easy to manage and easy to manipulate, for better or worse\n\n- A great amount of items, weapons, shards, demons and map size to discover and collect. Made the game live on a little longer which is very appreciated.\n\n- Beautiful graphics that are somewhat rarer on the Metroidvania side of games. Really hoping this slowly becomes a trend as I believe a lot of Metroidvania games with going for a more detailed graphic perspective may add to the immersion of the game. \n\n-[spoiler]Miriam is bae[/spoiler]\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\n\nBloodstained: Ritual of the Night was a game I was excited for, heard very mixed reviews which almost put me off the game. The game has had it's problems, I won't deny that, but some of the problems are really up to the player if they wish to see it as problems. One person may not care that some shards are borderline useless while someone else may take offense to it. Some people may not care that the Great Sword weapons are super slow because they're running around with Katana weapons only, whereas someone else may feel their options are limited now so the game doesn't punish them with slower attack speed. With that said, it's still a fantastic games despite the flaws it had. I enjoyed the game very much. It wasn't stressful where I was getting enraged at some cheap death, but it wasn't something that was so easy that I got bored with it. The whole time playing I was just looking forward to getting to new areas to see new enemies, see the layout and get to hear what soundtrack would be associated with it. Bosses were also pretty cool and another element I was looking forward to seeing. All in all, it was well worth my purchase and a game I seriously enjoyed and didn't want it to really end just yet. Really looking forward to what the devs do next with this game and any future projects down the road.\n\n10/10 game, worth every cent, highly recommend you give it a try!",Recommended

"I was pretty excited to try this being a huge fan of the 2D Castlevanias, one of my earliest memories of gaming was playing Simon's Quest. Overall I would have recommended this game despite some pretty bad art, uninspired characters, poor plot (even by Castlevania standards) it was fun and it was still Castlevania.\n\nThe final area however is an asset recycle that accounts for 20% of the map. This is so unbelievably misleading, lazy, and shockingly tacky.\n\nGet the game if it's 20% off since 20% of the content is tacked on filler.\n\n___\n\nGame was completed on Hard difficulty.",Not Recommended
"excellent game.  decent graphics, and yes, there's the AWESOME castlevania nostalgia factor.... but, besides that, it just holds up GREAT.  it's balanced.  not too hard... but rewarding.... there's a great pacing so that as you level up you feel powerful, but there's always a challenge ahead... nothing insurmountable; but nothing too easy either.",Recommended
"Symphony of the Night + Order of Ecclesia = Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night\n\nAnd damn is it good!\n\nIf you love either of those Castlevania games, then definitely get this!",Recommended
"I didn't Kickstart this game... and now I regret it.\nI wasn't really interested in Bloodstained when it was first announced, but after getting my hands on an E3 demo and then watching trailers for it, it got me excited for the game. I've never really been a fan of the Metroidvania style of games, but this game has given me a new look at the genre.\n\nI love Miriam as a character, I think she was well written, designed really well, just overall a great character. I'm disappointed we didn't get see more of Gebel but what can you do eh?\n\nThe soundtrack for the game is absolutely fantastic! The opening level music has stuck in my head, as well as the music for when you enter the castle. All the music in this game matches the levels perfectly.\n\nMy 1 gripe about the game is that it is still quite glitchy. I have noticed a coupled of times that hits don't register even though you're literally next to the enemy or boss, I encountered a glitch that almost soft locks the game after going into the inventory menu, Miriam's head will randomly disappear and if you're coming out of the menu it will just load none stop. So admittedly these glitches being present and not ironed out just yet, is a bit disappointing but it didn't hinder my experience that much.\n\nOverall I'm really happy with Bloodstained: Ritual Of The Night. Well made game by an iconic developer, brought back into the modern day when games always seem to be Action Adventure or Shooters. I would love for there to be a potential sequel, I'm not sure how it would go story wise, but if there isn't one, I won't be disappointed. I really enjoyed my time with this game, and would encourage anyone to give it a go!\n\nMy overall rating of Bloodstained: Ritual Of The Night is - 8/10",Recommended
"There's a lot to like about Bloodstained, but there is a whole boatload of problems that just cannot be ignored, enough to even sully a review's recommendation. \n\nThe good consists of incredibly smooth gameplay, a strong and deep character building system with the Shards and weapon creation, which expands even on what was seen in Castlevania: Aria/Dawn of Sorrow. With that depth, you can easily overlook the incredibly bland levels, the forgettable music, and the downright comical enemies. However, there are some deep flaws that cripple the game, preventing it from being anything other than just another IGA style Castlevania, (and probably the worst of the bunch, to be perfectly candid) and that is the game's difficulty. \n\nRitual of the Night is not a fair game, by any stretch of the imagination. Unlike the infamously difficult Order of Ecclesia, it is rare that a death in Bloodstained feels deserved. Hitboxes are far too punishing, as simply brushing up against the majority of bosses will inflict just as much damage as their attacks, and they move with little rhyme or reason, with zero wind up. Not to say that you cannot overcome obstacles in this game, but you don't win by meticulously learning the moves and dodging well. You simply get into a damage race with each and every boss, chugging healing items until you win. It is not satisfying whatsoever, and to learn the patterns instead is an exercise in futility. As early as the second boss, it is a roll of the dice how any boss will behave, and it never, ever gets better.\n\nAs well, the game has enormous technical issues. Game crashes are constant, and save points are scarce enough that you will lose progress when Bloodstained inevitably and inexplicably decides to fizzle and die.\n\nIt's still enjoyable. It's a Castlevania game, and there was plenty of love that went into it. But at the end of the day, if either Konami starts making proper installments again, or Ritual of the Night receives a sequel that answers these concerns, this will simply be viewed as a forgettable step down. The game is a C- at best.",Not Recommended
"This is everything I could have wanted from a spiritual successor to Castlevania: Symphony of the Night and it's descendants. Bloodstained looks amazing, has sharp controls, wonderful environments, beautiful music, excellent bosses, and a ton of weapons, armors, items, spells, etc. \n\nThe work Igarashi and his team have done on this game is nothing short of mind-boggling. I really appreciate the love and attention put in to the game, and I cannot wait for the DLC. \n\nIf you love class SotN, you are almost guaranteed to love this as well.",Recommended
"Ehhhhh. Some spoilers, obviously. Play the game first, you dingus. It's good. tldr at the bottom. Do note that I backed the Kickstarter, just in case that might make me seem biased in one way or another.\n\n[h1] Good Things [/h1]\nIt's great at the core. The level design is top notch. There were always little moments where I said to myself ""how can I get there"" before returning later and having that 'aha!' moment that Igavanias are so good at inducing. You can also use a few movement options in creative ways to get stuff a tiny bit before you're supposed to. Not a whole lot of sequence breaking that I found. Once you beat the Underground Sorcery Lab's boss the game really opens up. Secret areas were well spread out and usually pretty well telegraphed. Managed to clear to whole map without a guide, but I needed some help for the last few breakable walls that didn't lead to separate rooms. Tons of other fun little easter eggs as well. The piano was a treat.\n\nCombat is a lot of fun. Movement is crisp and weighty, attacks are fast, sliding and back-stepping are fun options but don't feel as strong as other Igavania games. Back-step cancelling is a thing but I never really found it useful. Jumping to the other side of a boss when it attacks and wailing on it is usually the best option. The bosses that break this formula are the best in the game. Techniques being weapon specific even when mastered is a bit of a downer, but otherwise it's great. Tons of cool shard abilities to play with, although some are pretty much strictly better than others. As an example, Void Ray can be acquired before Tis Rozain and it's pretty much just better. Lots of really cool abilities by the end game. No major spoilers, but the super boss drops one of the coolest powers in any game ever. \n\nThe 'you didn't actually beat the game yet' trick is decently well thought out. It's pretty much split into two halves; acquiring the means to reveal the Recommended final boss, and then travelling to and fighting the Recommended final boss. The first half is done really well. Unique level design and boss fights on that end of things. The second half isn't as great. Once you use the  McGuffin to reveal who's really pulling the strings, the rest of the game is just a scaled up and repainted version of the Garden of Silence and Forbidden Underground Waterway areas with harder enemies. You even get the speed boost shard in this area, which sucks as it would've been a lot of fun to use throughout the rest of the game. Pretty big letdown. The Recommended final boss is rad though.\n\n[h1] Bad Things? [/h1]\nOkay now the not so great stuff. The soundtrack was a bit disappointing to me. It was fine, but only a couple of songs really stick out in my mind. They're generally thematically appropriate but just feel weakly instrumented. Could use some improvement. The graphics are a mixed bag. Miriam animates smoothly and looks great, the enemies are awesome in terms of design, and the areas generally look really nice. The other NPCs look muddy and ugly. The models are pretty rigid and don't animate well. Some of the bosses also have this issue, particularly the humanoid ones. Any time the game attempts to have a cutscene it looks like a mess. They're rendered using the game's engine so the actors are usually under-textured and poorly animated. In particular the cutscene before the train sequence made me pause and put down the controller to think about how awful it looked. The voice acting is awful, period. Miriam might be the only exception, but her constant grunts and cries in combat are grating. I ended up turning off the voices completely eventually. \n\nThere were a few small game play issues I encountered. Take these with a grain of salt as they might be induced by error on my end. Enemy loot drops would regularly get stuck in terrain and force me to wait for them to automatically fly to my inventory. Miriam was also prone to clipping some terrain, although this was relatively infrequent and was usually just fixed by mashing jump. Shards would occasionally just not activate when I pressed the button, but would still consume MP. Some of the hit detection is pretty funky, especially on a few bosses. There were one or two instances that left me scratching my head wondering how I had taken a hit. Even if it's consistent, being consistently unclear is still a bad thing in my opinion. \n\n[h1] Final [/h1]\nWow, thanks for reading. Overall Ritual of the Night is great at it's core. It's fast paced, it's tight, it's expansive, it's everything that an Igavania needed to be a great game. But it lacks a lot of polish. I'll definitely return to this game frequently if DLC is published as was promised by IGA, but I think a sequel that addresses a lot of the little polish issues would really bring this new take on exploration based platformers to the next level. If IGA ends up producing another game in this vein after Bloodstained (ignore the pun), it could be one of the best games ever given a little more love and attention to detail on the little things. \n\n[b]TL;DR[/b]; it's great, tons of fun and replay value. buy it, support the devs, be wary of a few issues in terms of overall polish. The sequel has potential to be absolutely incredible if these problems are addressed\n\nedit: some formatting",Recommended

"If you're a fan of Metroidvania games, or a fan of Castlevania, then you will enjoy this game. Aside from being created by one of the creators behind Castlevania's arguably most classic titles, the game lives up to the feelings that I believe all Metroidvania titles strive for. Heavily comparable to Castlevania: Symphony of the Night, this game takes the fundamentals and builds off of them. Fantastic level design, a marvelous soundtrack, and game-play that (while reminiscent of older titles) comes off as being innovative and fun. What I think is the most fun for me, is that the game comes chalk full of references and Easter eggs that are subtle (or even sometimes not so subtle) nods to other titles in the genre. The game is well worth the price, and has replayability with new game plus and boss rush modes. Take my word, and absolutely pick this title up!",Recommended

"It’s interesting to see how long development cycles can impact how a game is received. Back in 2015, a spiritual successor to Castlevania (featuring much of the original creative staff) was an appealing prospect. Konami showed little interest in Castlevania, or indeed any of their other dormant IP they kept drugged and strung up in the Konami dungeons. Four years later, and it feels like a new metroidvania hits steam every other week, and Bloodstained is now up against some fierce competition.\n\nAnd on that point we might as well address the bone golem in the room, which is the price. 35 quid is pretty bonkers for a 2D platformer unless you’re working with Nintendo’s production values and brand recognition, which Bloodstained just isn’t. The 2.5D graphics are a mixed bag, looking rather lovely at times and shockingly amateurish at others, despite the complete overhaul that delayed the game by a year. The walking animations of some of the supporting cast in particular are dangerously close to someone who has twisted on 20 and is shuffling to the nearest toilet. The likes of Hollow Knight and Monster Boy have really upped the ante in terms of presentation, and Bloodstained is pretty underwhelming in comparison – though I will say the music is excellent.\n\nIn terms of gameplay, Bloodstained is pretty much just Symphony of the Night, which should come as little surprise to anyone who backed it as that’s exactly what it was sold as. While Bloodstained might be a recast it’s a bloody convincing one - if you love SoTN, you’re all but certain to enjoy this as well. It perfectly understands what made that game tick, and I can’t fault the controls, combat or sense of interlinked progression the genre is known for. There’s always something new to keep you interested – there are about 6 billion different weapons, spells and pieces of equipment to find, which does mean that the difficulty curve is closer to a difficulty waveform at times.\n\nThat’s assuming you don’t just break the game completely – like SotN, balance between spells and weapons is all but non-existent and there are a couple in there that render most of the bosses quite trivial after a massive difficulty spike near the beginning.  Personally, I find that discovering all the broken combos is part of the fun – it’s a single player game, so you’re spoiling nobody’s fun but your own.\n\nIt’s a sizeable game as well – while it can probably be completed in about 10-12 hours if you rush, there’s plenty to do and find off the beaten track, and as you’d hope it frequently rewards you for doing so. I don’t think it’s much of a spoiler to fans of SotN to suggest that there might be a Not Recommended ending about half way through the game, and all in all I spent about 25 hours fully exploring the map and defeating all the bonus bosses. The last 20% of the game was unfortunately a notable drop in quality, and felt a little rushed compared to the mostly excellent level design up to that point. It’s clear that these last couple of areas were not given the love they needed so that the devs could actually ship the product, and after 4 long years in development I can sympathise.\n\nWhile I’m moaning about level design this brings me to my biggest criticism of the game - sometimes the key to progressing in Bloodstained is unnecessarily cryptic or illogical. There was more than one occasion where even after looking up the solution I don’t feel like I would have eventually worked it out myself except by accident. As an example, you often get ability shards from bosses that grant you abilities that open up new areas. Every regular enemy can drop a shard as well and these will have magic, familiars or stat boosts when equipped. These are not required for progression, and are essentially optional equipment and abilities…except for an underwater area about 60% of the way through the game where the key to advancing is a shard dropped from a random regular enemy.\n \nIt’s worth noting that shards do not always drop, and in fact can be quite rare. That so many people get stuck here is not a surprise – gating progression behind a random drop is frankly terrible game design and I’d honestly expect better from Koji Igarashi. As a much more minor quibble there are a few too many items hidden in breakable walls – while this is a nice mythology gag it does mean testing out every wall in every room to check no-one hid a health upgrade in the pipes. \n\nSo is Bloodstained the worthy successor to Castlevania that it pitched itself as? Overall, yeah, I’d say it is – even with a few rough edges and dodgy design choices it’s a really great game, and the heavy RPG elements and incredible number of weapons encourage multiple playthroughs. After many of the nostalgia fuelled kickstarter revivals landed with a wet splat, it’s encouraging to finally see one live up to the promise. Is it worth 35 quid? That’s a tougher question, and there’s no doubt it feels very expensive compared to other Metroidvanias on steam, including ones I’d say surpass it both in production values and design. \n",Recommended

"I wish I could give this game something other than a yes or no rating I really enjoy it but there's lots of little nagging issues that make me only want to play it for an hour or so at a time. It's got all the castlevania things we like. It costs 40 bucks... and with all these nagging issues... It's hard to advise someone to pick it up unless they REALLY like Castlevania.\n\n-a lot of the weapons are kind of useless because they're so limited in the way they attack or the windup time it takes to make the attack is limiting etc when compared to the sheer amount of enemies comming at you in some areas.\n\n-Enemy's touching you deal damage to you and their hitboxes are generous sometimes to the point where you just can't attack back if you are too close to them.\n\n-The map design is typically confounding for a Castlevania type of game. Causes you to do a lot A LOT of backtracking on your first play through and there's no good direction as to where you should go. You go in a direction until you can't go there, then you pick another direction, I'm 6 hours in and I'm running out of directions. Locked doors or weird contrived barriers designed to block your passage aren't marked on your map so you end up with this sprawling map with LOTS of uncompleted areas that are just uncomplete because you can't reach them yet so if you ever put this game down for a while and come back to it a bit later you're just utterly clueless as to exactly which piece of empty map you need to complete.\n\n-There's no clues in the game as to where you need to go next. Npc at your main base area tells you to ""go to the soandso place"" but you don't have an omniscient knowledge of the map locations and the names don't clearly tell you where they would be, it's not like ""Go to the basement for the thing"" or ""Go to the top of the clock tower for the thing."" instead it's ""Go to the room with the stained glass"".\n\n-The crafting system is in depth, but its super grindy / farmy  to the point that I don't even try to dive too far into it unless I just happen to have all the ingredients I need to make the thing I want.\n\n- most weapon groups have an attack mode that is used with the down, diagonal, forward ""street fighter fireball"" attack motion and some can even chain... and then some weapons within that group will inexplicably just not work with that special attack mode even after you've mastered the technique for it.",Not Recommended

"Before beginning my review in earnest I must proclaim that not only am I a backer of this title, but a $300 one at that.  Considering this information I would understand that there is ample expectation that I would be an overzealous advocate for the title.  I will do my best to put forth an honest and fair evaluation regardless of my investment and initial expectations of the game.\n\nTo start with a summary for those who aren't interested in a complete rundown, the game is good.  I would say it is all around very well made with some areas better than others, but without any specific parts having significant drawbacks.  The criticisms I will provide are all somewhat negligible so for anyone interested in purchasing I would say that without a doubt the game (at it's current iteration before any major patchwork or DLC) is very worth it.  Take all of the following with a grain of salt over time as there is plenty of free content and updates coming down the line that may alter or invalidate parts of this review.\n\nTo start off, I would like to address the gameplay mechanics.  Anyone familiar with metroidvania games will quite easily pickup the playstyle here.  I have played all the Castlevania games to date so I seemlessly jumped in with absolutely no learning curve necessary to figure out.  I would presume the simplicity of the mechanics would lend themselves to be easily picked up even by those with no prior experience however.  As you progress through the game new mechanics will unlock that also act like keys of sort to advance to areas that were previously not accessible.  This is a pretty familiar style of implementation in Castlenvania games so it likely come as a surprise.  It was a nice surprise that a couple of these mechanics were not spoon fed in nature like most games, so there is a small amount of out of the box thinking in order to proceed through certain areas for the first time.  The ability to attain these new mechanics outside of the standard ""kill boss get skill"" pattern was refreshing.  If there is a drawback from this it is that some of these mechanics are barely used.  One even gets exactly one use ever in the form of progression which makes it feel slightly under utilized.  Considering all of these have uses in standard combat and traversal though it is easy to not care about this.  There are several types of optional combat mechanics that can be used viably so varied playstyles are supported for progressing through the whole game.  I even went the extra mile of tying the hardest bosses on hard difficulty with wildly different setups as to test how viable the different types of combat actually are.  I can safely say that while I personally believe the different weapon and spell types could be better balanced, they are all well represented and usable throughout the game.  As far as the different mobility options are concerned, there are some mechanics that can overlap in usefulness so it also can come down to preference in many circumstances as far as traversal options.\n\nAs far as audio and visuals are concerned, I am personally of the belief that they are very good.  The game will definitely not be the best looking title you play this year, but it definitely has artistic nuance and details that are beyond what I had expected.  The initial pitch did present a purely 2D sprite based look but this ended up not being the case.  The game takes place on mostly 2D plane with 3D models for the character and all the enemies.  The background are also three dimensional in nature with some of the areas presenting some gorgeous effects.  I can say that there were several times I stopped momentarily to admire the design.  I found the foreground to have received noticeably less attention.  It's not that the walls, ceilings, and doors are badly designed but rather that it appeared that there was a definite choice to make the background the focal point for visual design.  There are a few areas where the foreground was uniquely implemented however.  The camera remains locked for nearly the entire game with very select instances chosen to manipulate the viewpoint in order to show off extra design choice.  My criticism here is that the moments where these changes happened made me desire more of such designs.  Largely the visuals are appealing while playing and the areas have enough variation that you probably won't get bored of any single scenery type before you move on.\n\nThe audio is quite well composed with a definite overall theme but with solid variation so you will likely be able to identify each area by the soundtrack alone.  There are a couple surprised in the compositions as well so even for those coming in with expectations based on previous igavania works there is a pleasant selection provided.  As far as other sound effects are concerned, the sound design is well matched with all of the attacks and creatures.  I don't believe for the most part that the sound effects with become repetitious.  The exception to this rule will likely lie with the player character herself.  There are certain dialogue lines that will be repeated whenever you cast certain spells that you may end up hearing dozens of times.  The voice over work is well done though, so it shouldn't ever become grating even if it is repetitious depending on your consistent use of the exact same moves.\n\nThe enemy variation honestly surprised me.  I didn't expect there to be such a wide array of enemies.  This comes with a caveat of the fact that certain enemies may appear somewhat ridiculous.  Certain backers were able to have their pets added to the game as enemies so coming across those may throw you for a loop.  There are a couple other enemies that may also feel slightly out of place thematically but not enough so to pull you out of the experience.  The variation in designs is also reflected in combat with different encounters requiring different different tactics to avoid a drawn out combat at times.  I will say that as with almost any game, it is possible to get to the point where you will use one weapon or spell for almost every monster.  This is largely personal preference though as I spent over an hour killing with only one gun soon after swapping from playing all night with only one sword with no issues.  This provides a malleable experience while fighting that let's you experiment but still retains some challenge.  After the first play through, I did feel like the enemies were sadly not as challenging on hard as I had hoped based on my previous experiences in dealing with them on normal.  Similarly nightmare mode provided even less of a scaling challenge as it appears to be the same level of difficulty as hard simply with the limitation of not being able to level up at all.  Overall while the game is initially challenging in both normal enemies and bosses, you will likely need to place arbitrary restrictions on yourself to keep challenge after multiple play throughs.  It is hard to complain about overpowered weapons or spells though since they provide a nice crutch for players with less experience or skill to progress.  The power ups like these are also mostly out of the way or grindy to get so you won't be flying through encounters right away.  The bosses themselves are well varied but not exactly consistent in progression difficulty.  There were definitely a handful of boss fights that were unexpectedly easier than previous ones.  There are a handful of hidden bosses and mini-bosses to spice things up as well though.\n\nThe weakest point of core of the game is undoubtedly the story unfortunately.  While the dialogue isn't poorly written per se, there is definitely no real depth to the story presentation.  Most of the plots points you encounter while progressing are quite straight forward and quick to move from point A to point B.  Some of the exposition feels like little more than this happened so do this dressed up in a few creative naming conventions.\n\nRating: B+",Recommended
"First metroidvania I ever played and it's quite good. Graphics is nice, music is not bad, gameplay is fluid and not too difficult and story is not bad. \n\n7.5/10 will cheese all boss with the shield weapon (try it, it's amazing how R1 spamming can get you so far in a game lol)",Recommended
"Have to say that Bloodstained really feels like a ""real"" Castlevania. Game mechanics are quite similar to Castlevania titles on GBA and NDS (in a good way.) The fighting is solid, the music is fantastic and the graphics are good. The game runs really well even on a mid-tier rig on MAX-settings. Started playing with V-sync off and had some tearing, but the screen tearing vanished after turning V-sync back on. Overall the game feels really solid and I could recommend it to any Castlevania-fan out there.",Recommended

Just an idea, but overall you have to try this if you are a Castlvaina completionist.",Recommended
"A quick explanation of what the Metroidvania sub-genre is will hopefully help those unfamiliar with it to get through the review, and will more or less sum up the majority of Bloodstaineds gameplay. The term is thrown around a lot these days, but its definition isn’t as vague as you think. If the game doesn’t comprise of these elements it isn’t a Metroidvania: \n\n- It has RPG mechanics (without RPG mechanics it would make more sense to just liken it the Metroid series)\n- A large open-world map, generally grid-based in structure \n- The game is a 2D side-scroller (If it isn’t a 2D side-scroller then it wouldn’t make sense to compare it to Castlevania or Metroid – both of which are 2D side-scrollers)\n- Exploration centers around finding new upgrades which are needed to traverse particular obstacles, often requiring backtracking \n- The game offers choice in which order you can explore the world in and how you customise your character (to an extent obviously)\n\nA staple of the Metroidvania sub-genre is choice. Choice in how you play the game and in what order you play the game, and Bloodstained is no exception. Alongside the array of Shards to find and use, players also get to decide on what equipment they use, how their character looks, what order they’d like to explore the castle and other choices regarding their character. A great addition I thought was the Shortcut Shard, which let you make preset equipment load outs which you could switch to on the go. Meaning you didn’t have to constantly pause and search menus to equip your character again when you wanted to try something new. Something strange I found however, is that you can only find 4 of the 8 Shortcut Shards per playthrough, meaning you can only have 4 loadouts on your first playthrough. This seems like an odd choice, as most players probably won’t replay the game a second time, and having the full 8 accessible would have meant more freedom with experimentation of playstyles. Still a great addition however, and a small critique. \n\nThe game is consistently giving you new ways to play and new areas to explore. And one of the ways the game does this is by using some abilities as a necessity for progressing through the game. Now unlike in SOTN (Castlevania Symphony of The Night) where there’s only 3 abilities that you really need throughout the game for exploration, Bloodstained has about 6. And unlike SOTN, Bloodstained doesn’t really utilize these very well. Instead of the map like in SOTN where the world map is made in such a way that you will consistently need to use the three abilities once you have them, and making sure you don’t feel confused when you see an obstacle that requires you to collect one of the power-ups all while containing the exploration aspect so as not to be overwhelming or confusing – Bloodstained instead has a myriad of a different abilities required for just a couple or sometimes even one obstacle. Now this wouldn’t be so much of a problem if these abilities actually had some sort of dual use, but they don’t – well one or two barely do. So instead you have about two of the six abilities which you’ll be consistently using and the others are just but on the backburner either because they’re simply not needed anymore or have been totally replaced by a newer ability gained. And if I’m being completely honest only one of them was enjoyable to use, and some of the others are incredibly tedious to use. The castle invert ability however is a fantastic idea, and is a very clever way of taking inspiration from SOTN without simply imitating it. \n\nWhile the depth in exploration might be lacking, the combat has definitely been improved to a genre peak. Countless enemies and bosses are found throughout the game to defeat, each offering unique gimmicks and methods of defeating them. Combat is quick and snappy, all the weapon types feel unique from one another and are satisfying to use and the variety in enemies means constantly adapting to new strategies in how you attack. And because of the flexibility of the combat system there is virtually an endless amount of ways to play the game. Which is both a good and a bad thing. A bad thing because with such flexibility it makes it hard to balance the game, meaning a lot of players will probably find the game very easy as it’s not difficult to find hidden equipment or farm for equipment which will render you god-like for some time. Now difficulty doesn’t equal quality, and Bloodstained is luckily pretty high in quality. It is a good thing however in the regard that if players do find the game too easy or too difficult there are basically infinite ways to work around it. With almost every character upgrade being optional outside of levelling up and the few Shards mandatory to progress through the game, the game can be as easy or as hard as you want it to be really. And with new game plus and difficulty settings this is only improved infinitely.\n\nBloodstained capitalises on its lonely atmosphere very well, not relying on its story, but more the actual feeling of experiencing the games different areas. Every area feels fairly unique from one another, the music throughout the game constantly adds to the character and feel of each area, and is generally pretty memorable overall despite a sometimes overbearing resemblance to the Castlevania series. Now considering the fact you’re alone 99% of the game, Bloodstaineds atmosphere rarely feels heavy or scary, but is generally filled with wonder and excitement. With often high tempo orchestral music getting you pumped to mow down thousands of demons and zoom through the castles hidden nooks and crannies. Bloodstained is a fun game, and it doesn’t try to be much else, but it still manages to capture some very genuine emotions in its different environments and atmospheres. Like the looming fear of the abandoned laboratory, or the beauty and wonder of The Garden of Silence.  Visually each area is a joy to look at, and definitely outshines the character models and animations which I’ll get to later. The feeling of simply exploring each area, and looking forward to the next crazy enemy discovered or finding a shortcut back to older areas is a feeling hard to nail – and Bloodstained nails it perfectly.\n\nWhile the games environments, music and gameplay might have the polish of an AAA title, the animations and character models do not. The environments have a very polished, realistic look to them, many of the characters and enemies have a cell-shaded look instead. Very bright colours and an almost cartoony looks don’t really mix well with the background I’m afraid, and this problem is consistent throughout the game, with a few standout enemies and bosses looking particularly bad. The animations too are a little janky at times, and never looked as realistic and believable as the environments. I adjusted to this over time, the issue isn’t enough to ruin the game, but enough to lose some points for me. Amongst all of these average qualities, are some really bad ones. And I can assure you that some of the cut scenes are so poorly animated and choreographed that I was actually bewildered at some points – the cut scenes in question certainly ascend to the so bad they’re funny quality. The problem doesn’t lie with the voice acting, but rather the bizarre pacing and animations during the cut scenes. \n\nI saved talking about the story for last because it is arguably the least important part of the game. In saying that, the story is actually rather enjoyable for what it is. It has a cast of enjoyable and memorable characters, and actually has some decent twists here and there. The gameplay and the story play well into one another and I was generally invested in the story overall throughout the game. It’s good for what it is, but Bloodstained is simply a good time to play, and that’s all it tries to do. This game is made a for a particular group of people, and they know when they are. \n",Recommended

If you played Castlevania Symphony of the Night about 20 years ago and have always wanted another game like it then this is definitely for you. There are a lot of callbacks to that game including some of the same voice actors that voice similiar roles. This game is really fun and highly recommended if you like classic 2.5D action. The gameplay is strictly 2D but the graphics are rendered in 3D. I dual-analog controller is strongly recommended and clearly the intended way to play this game.\n\nThe only downside is that I wish the game was longer. It's about 20-40 hours to beat the story and find all map locations but I still wanted more.  This is definitely one of my favorite games so far this year.,Recommended
"I backed it on Kickstarter (so my experience included Iga's Backpack DLC) and it's pretty much exactly what I was hoping it would be. The upcoming 13 free DLCs are just a very nice cherry on top. Some people say it's too easy. I don't really care about that. I've never found any of the Igavania games to be particularly difficult once you get around 1/3 of the way through, and breaking them to become an overpowered god (or goddess as the case may be) is part of the fun for me.\n\nSome people don't like the art style, but that's entirely subjective. I think it looks fine (for the most part anyway...there are a few things here and there that look awkward and there are some occasional issues with being able to tell what you can interact with -- meaning sometimes it's hard to tell if a thing is in the foreground or the background). But barring a few minor nitpicks, I really enjoyed the game.\n\nI beat it 100% on Normal, then 100% NG+ on Hard. Then I played for a little bit on NG++ Nightmare before deciding to start a fresh game on Hard. Finished that at 99.8% (I know which room I missed) and all the Boss Rush modes (which I did find a little disappointing because you are rewarded with things that are already available in the game -- specifically, common loot and 8/16/32-bit coins). I haven't really messed with the Speed Run mode yet (I checked it out VERY briefly, just to the end of the Galleon, so I can't really say much about it. They do automatically disable unnecessary tutorials and animations, and they track your time for each segment of the run, but I suspect actual speed runners would want to use their own tools for that).\n\nThe first playthrough, where I really did do almost everything (100% map, 100% in the Archives except for Techniques) took me about 60 hours. Lots of farming involved with that. My Hard new game took more like 30 hours, and when I did the Hard run on NG+ it only took like 10 hours tops.\n\nIf you like Igavania games (or Metroidvania games in general), then I recommend giving it a try. 9/10",Recommended

"TL;DR:\nTruly one of the best Metroidvania games I've played. Did you like Symphony of the Night? Do you wish there was more Symphony of the Night, but with updated graphics, even better mechanics, and even more stuff? Then buy this game. Buy it now and start playing it.\n\n\nOverall Thoughts:\nThe game tackles many elements so well, it's hard to know where to start. The reward curve feels excellent, and you end up feeling like a god(dess) by the end with all the abilities you've unlocked. The boss design is fantastic, and the general enemy design is quite solid. The number of weapons, armor, powers, etc. all make for a very rich experience with a ton of versatility. It captures the soul of a Metroidvania completely, in my opinion, and I would love to play a sequel. I love the main character's style, which is what I'd dub ""Aggressively Feminine""--think a less over-the-top Bayonetta, and you'll get a feel for it. \n\nI've personally 100%ed the game, and it was really just a very enjoyable experience, and well worth the money spent.\n\nDespite my overwhelming enjoyment of the game, here are some critiques that I feel should be noted, even if they are completely overshadowed by how good this game is:\n\n1) I did run into a number of glitches and game crashes that were pretty frustrating at times. Sometimes the game would crash if I tried to read from a bookcase, and I once had an audio glitch that had a terrible looped sound effect constantly playing following a boss fight and the ensuing cutscenes. I rolled with the glitches since I played the game shortly after release, and these things happen. Just be aware that, as for now, make sure to save often and expect to possibly run into the occasional bug. Hopefully they'll have them fixed here very soon. \n\n2) Graphics feel a bit dated. This is very understandable given the focus on gameplay and the fact that it's a Kickstarter game, but it can be a little jarring at first. Also, there's occasionally times where the bloodstains from enemies look a bit wonky on certain geometries.\n\n3) Getting ""Recommended"" ending of the game requires a lot of exploration and some very counter-intuitive approaches. Chances are good that you'll get stuck and have to look at a guide at some point, and constant need to look for hidden areas could be tedious for some people (you get a power later on that makes it way easier, FYI). Personally, I find it perfectly in line with old-school Japanese developers and it feels Recommended to its roots, but I could see how newcomers to the genre could find it a bit frustrating.\n\n4) The crafting system can get tedious at times. It only really hit me when I was going for 100% completion of the item list, and thus had to build at least one of every single item in the game, but I could imagine it being somewhat tedious even for people who aren't being as completionist as I.\n\nFinal Thoughts:\nBuy this game.",Recommended

"For a modern ""Vania"" style game that has modern 3D graphics, it manages to transcend both generations perfectly. Bloodstained plays like the best of the Castlevania series and follow a familiar formula for those who played SotN, AoS, etc. \n\nWhile the story won't win any awards. It does manage to fit in several on the nose references that work in to the over arching narrative perfectly, whether that be the characters themselves, bits of dialogue, enemies and setting. Bloodstained pulls it off without much breaking up the experience. \n\nThe sound design is fairly decent as well. The music is on-point with a fellow Konami composer working on this game with the director. The Main menu and end themes are beautiful and boss specific songs really escalate the intense factor of being in a confined boss room trying to learn the patterns of the boss' attack while trying to win.\n\nThe weapons, armor, and everything else included in the game are also what you'd expect from Castlevania, aside a couple added features. Bloodstained allows you to sort of cosmetically tweak Miriam the main protagonist by changing her hairstyle, hair colour, and clothing colours. For it not having that many options. It surprisingly does a good job of making her look different enough in each that there probably is a look of choice for anyone looking for that sort of thing.\n\nNow importantly. How it runs on PC. The 3D graphics look great compared to the Beta footage we seen leading up to release. It's my experience that it ran perfectly in 4k, ultra settings on my PC, with only gameplay glitches that I would experience also playing @1080p (item drops clipping so they can't be picked up). Only other glitch I experienced was the Twin Dragons Tower dropping me below the boss allowing for an easy kill in that area.\n\nWith 100% done I felt I should write a review for once advocating the praise it deserves for a Kickstarter project. And for a kickstarter project , I got all my monies worth.",Recommended

(you think it's a hit... but it's not) I recommend to use another weapon when this happen too much.\n- Some random reaction speed from bosses. They can slash you in like 0.2 seconds... but normally, they have a really SLOW reaction speed where you can slash them twice with a katana.\n- Trolls! Few trolls early in the game. Most trolls later on. For me it's just a bit too much trolls in this game for me to enjoy it.\n- They built the game in a way that if you never play it.. you'll just die and die. You'll get trolled.

"The Recommended successor to Castlevania: Symphony of the Night, in all its strange, opulent, bombastic, hilariously unbalanced glory. \n\nMetroidvania games, especially the kind with the word 'Metroid' in the title, tend to be these perfectly crafted Swiss watches of game design, where every new item either opens new doors, offers a new traversal method, or makes you stronger in some simple linear way. Bloodstained, like Castlevania: SOTN et al before it, isn't really like this. While it has a lot of the genre's tropes, this by no means an attempt at finely-honed design perfection. Instead, it's an RPG which bombards you with dozens upon dozens of new weapons (which mostly tend to feel very different to each other), accessories, abilities, outfits etc which allow you a kind of playstyle experimentation and self-expression which actually doesn't tend to be a huge part of this genre, generally. Do you wanna wear a Santa hat + masquerade mask and twat blokes with a shovel? You can do that. Do you want to be a cowgirl hat-wearing gun-slinger? Yes. Do it. Keep your distance and use a spear + burn your enemies with fire in various ways? Burn away. And are you a little creep who wants to dress Miriam up like a bunny girl and wield a whip? This might shock you as most of the dev team was Japanese, but yes, you can. \n\nThis game can be a bit glitchy, and there's definitely a bit of jank to it generally, but it's fun as hell.",Recommended

"Never played Castlevanias before but this game lured me in with its art style and soundtrack for sure. I'm not even much of a Metroidvania fan but found the gameplay here very interesting so far (still playing about midway through at the moment of writing), there's many different ways to play depending on weapon selection and overall it takes a fair bit of skill to learn enemy and attack patterns and such, definitely gets easier once you get used to it though. I also liked the different techniques you can learn since they actually require fairly complex inputs to pull off and then you can basically extend your jumps with a quarter circle forward movement for instance. It also makes use of various magic you can pull off so you can customize that to your liking (usually the magic you gain is related to enemies you kill). I mostly went with greatswords, greatsword enhancements and Recommended Arrow and a barrier and it seems to be all I need.\n\nThe game looks great and I love exploring all over, every zone feels very distinct and I haven't had big issues getting stuck yet, although I've had to do some backtracking sometimes to find what I was missing. It is very free in terms of where you can go though, even most later areas you can go to in advance if you like, though some obstacle might prevent from progressing further. The enemy designs are very creative and can be just about anything. And the soundtrack is one of the best OSTs I've heard this year for sure, it's crazy good.\n\nWould recommend if you have any interest. The game's also pretty well optimized, played it on both desktop and my laptop and even my laptop could handle nearly max settings throughout. Only thing I'd maybe nitpick about is menu system for items, I'd rather use potions maybe directly ingame rather than going to menu for healing.",Recommended
"[H1]SYMPHONY OF THE NIGHT WRIT LARGE(R)[/H1]\n\nBetween Bloodstained, Monsterboy, Streets of Rage 4, and the Resident Evil 2 remake, 2019 is turning out the year of GOOD nostalgia.\n\nBoth Kenji Inafune and Koji Igarashi pitched us their ideas of spiritual successors for Megaman and Castlevania at similar times.\n\nUnlike Inafune, however (who made his game entirely with Kickstarter money), Igarashi used his KS specifically as a proof of concept in order to attract investors, thus producing Bloodstained with big boy money. The result is the most gorgeous 2D metroidvania ever, made by the original team (they even got both Michiru Yamane AND her sister for the game's music).\n\nGraphically speaking, the game is the AAA equivalent of 2D games (ok, it's 2.5D, but actually well done), a gold standard you only got to see in the Neo Geo and Sega Saturn (except, you know, in 4K this time); it's the way you'd have wanted your old 16bit games to look like back in the day. Musically speaking, the game sounds as good as it looks, and the gameplay is all you remember. [b]It's Symphony Of The Night Writ Large[/b].\n\nJust as with Wonderboy III's remake, however, I must warn you that we're no longer in the age of ""artificial difficulty"" where wonky controller feedback, cheap shots, and otherwise no-win situations inflated 8bit games' difficulty in order to make it last, so if you're a veteran like me, chances are you'll blitz through this game in days unless you pace yoursef. Take your time to enjoy it, stop to smell the flowers, pace yourself... we waited four years to see this game, after all. \n\nIn terms of replayability, there's a boss you can only fight in the post-game. In addition, the increased difficulty modes you unlock after finishing it don't inflate monster HP or damage, but rather add more monsters per zone, so I wouldn't call them ""harder"" as much as ""Extra Fun Mode."" Also you'll probably want to do New Game+ if you want 100% map completion.\n\nEnjoy the trip down the nostalgia lane, I know I'm doing it.\n\n[b]10/10, playing New Game+ already[/b].",Recommended

"There are mainly 2 reasons why I'm not recommending this game. But at first, if you are a Castlevania fan, I mean, a real fan, just go and play. And secondly, if you are a casual player, go ahead or get self resolved.\nMy first complaint comes from the in-game balance update. I dunno why the dev nerfed so many functional shards. If you think they are OP, well, why not delete them?\nThe reason why they are balanced, is to make other shards have more appearance in actual gameplay. But the outcome will only be that people still farm then upgrade for Grade9Rank9 Head at the beginning of the nightmare game. And working hours on slicing those portraits, to get G9R9 again.\nIt is because other shards are so WEAK. Who would use summon pig, toad etc. in real boss fight? If you wanna balance the performance of every shard, at least empower the REALLY WEAK shards, rather than barely nerf the functional ones.\n=======\nThe Second and the BIGGEST complaints about the game was the OST.\nI have learned old classical music for 15 years and have long been a fan of Mrs. Yamane Michiru, but how could you offer us an OST which half of them choke at the end? That's ridiculous.\nPlease Dev, PLEASE listen to me. Yamane's music worth the full prize of the game. But I am totally unsatisfied with how you treat the music and even angry about it. You guys present an unfinished version of a composer's art work to us. Not only us but Mrs. Yamane is disrespected. If you ask 100 composers whether they allow their work to be presented in a half. You didn't even to a Fade In/Out effect.\n=======\nOkay anyway I swear if they can solve the OST issues I will immediately recommend this game.",Not Recommended
"So far, this series has been pretty great for Castlevania/Metroidvania fans.\n\nCurse of the Moon is a great throwback to classic, NES Castlevania games\nAnd now, Ritual of the Night is a great spiritual successor to the 'metroidvania' Castlevania games (think Symphony of the Night)\n\nReally hoping to see more Bloodstained in the future!",Recommended
"Ok, it is good now.-",Recommended
"actually a really great game. it's a good amalgamation of classic late 90s early 00s castlevania. you get a really broad loadout system, where there's a magic spell associated with every enemy in the game. there's passive, active and directional spell types and you can equip 1 of each. there's a proper rpg equipment system, and a great variety of weapons    that do change your playstyle a bit. obviously the difference between a sword and a dagger isn't as huge as between a sword and a gun, but there's enough variety to keep it interesting. \n\nthere's a decent story here. nothing special but it's engaging enough. \n\ndavid hayter is in it. that's pretty cool.\n\nthe main hook is the combat, platforming, exploration loop which is just really good. you'll be learning attack patterns and hitting every wall looking for secrets in no time. \n\nmy only criticism is probably the character animations and designs, mostly for the regular enemies, is pretty flat. later in the game you'll also run into a lot of enemies that are just recolors of ones you've already beat with just more hp and more damage. the bosses keep being good and fun the whole way through, so it's not a dealbreaker.",Recommended
If you like Metroidvania style games you need to add this to your collection. Typically games don't keep my interest past the 10-20 hr mark but this one has done all that and more. The bosses each have their nuances and patterns that are fun to learn how to defeat. Any boss you may be having trouble with you can cheese with certain spells to get to the next area or item. Basically you can set your own difficulty within each difficulty setting by how you approach the fight. \n\nThere are plenty of secrets to figure out to get that 100%. Its one of the only games I've owned where I'm interested in obtaining every achievement and replaying to remember certain aspects of the storyline. \n\nNow that I read that the developers were forced to beat every boss on the hardest difficulty using daggers... it's peaked my interest in replaying using only melee weapons. Haven't had a game do that to me since Dark Souls 1. \n\nWorth every penny.,Recommended

"Oh boy.\n\nIf you are looking for a good metroidvania game look no further! Yes, there are many other good titles around, but they went great lengths to develop their own formula and twists (which is of course great). But here, my friend, here it comes a game which is made following the good old original formula, MINUS the things of Symphony of Night you are overlooking because of rose-tinted glasses.\n\nBloodstained is a much refined (and I must say, quite pretty looking) take on the DS Castlevania series. If you loved Order of Ecclesia or Dawn of Sorrow, you can grab and enjoy this pearl right now and have no regrets!\nBut even if you didn't play those classics, I bet you will love how nicely the developer put together this game. You will find:\n- responsive controls;\n- great gameplay;\n- lots of personality (humor, great atmosphere, and those sexy gothic vibes)\n- replay value (the game is going to expand a lot. For free);\n- a modern take of a classic genre (made by a few important industry veterans and lots of fresh talent);\n- eargasmic music.\n\nSo, should you become part of this happy fellowship enjoying Bloodstained?

"Before we start the ""review"", I wanna say that this is based off only an hour of gameplay. So if you wanna say ""You are one impatient fu-"" fair enough. But the game has failed to keep my interest during the first hour and I sadly have no intention of playing it further at this time. \n\nREVIEW\n\nThe story is too confusing. Especially during the beginning, information is Gatling Gunned to you. So before you can process the information, new information is thrown at you and you get overwhelmed. I also failed to get the connection to Curse of the Moon aside from the characters. Actually, trying to connect the two games in terms of story results in an even more confusion.\n\nThe gameplay is a mixed bag for me. The controls are precise, sure. The additional attacks are also a welcome addition as they add variety to the combat. Finally, the exploration aspect of the game has been done perfectly. That's pretty much where the positives end.\n\nFirst off, the way you use items simply breaks the flow of gameplay. There are no shortcut buttons. This means anytime you need to use a potion, you'll have to pause the game and choose inventory then use the item. They could have just added a quick use button but nope, I guess not. \n\nSecondly, while I like the Shard Mechanics, they are too OP as it stands. Sure, they're supposed to get you out of a sticky situation but with the mana regeneration, I become careless in my actions. That's not a good sign in a game that's supposed to provide a challenge.\n\nFinally, the weapon variety does not mean much when your choice affects little. Yes, the additional attacks are usable with the specific weapons, but\n1: They cost too much mana to be a worthy trade.\n2: There are no combos in this game.\n3:  [spoiler] Miriam's weapon is a whip in Curse of the Moon so I'm not sure why they even took this route. [/spoiler]\n\nThe soundtrack is decent and the visuals are up to par. Maybe a little bit below par but I don't give much of a shit about graphics if I'm being completely honest.\n\nFINAL THOUGHTS\n\nMetroidvania games are generally hit or miss for me. Sadly, for this price, this one was a miss for me. Maybe there is a point where the game becomes enjoyable. However, the gameplay and the story kept me from getting to that point.",Not Recommended

"I played this game for 47 hours and completely 100%ed it, so I suppose I have to recommend this game.\n\nIndeed, this fulfils virtually every expectation that someone could have from having played Castlevania: Symphony of the Night, or Aria of Sorrow, or likewise. For those who haven't played those games, but want to experience a classically-inspired, but [b]highly approachable[/b] Metroidvania with an emphasis on looting and mechanical progression, then look no further. Fine music, memorable locales, strong variety, many ways to play and lots of content - with more coming soon.\n\nThat's likely all you need to hear from me to decide whether this game is worth a purchase or not. The remainder is more of a review of its limitations - many of which are as much a consequence of its genre and scope as much as anything else. I do have my own (long) list of gripes and complaints about the game, but they're [i]in spite[/i] of me recognising it for all of its merits, and having been so completely drawn into its gameplay. \n\nIn summary, most of my complaints are due to how fundamentally simple the combat system is. For example; for the [i]most[/i] part, especially in the early game, every weapon has a single attack, no matter whether you're moving, standing, crouching or otherwise, which causes the apparently impressive weapon variety to quickly feel... less than impressive.\n\nFurthermore, as I played this game I actually found myself yearning for so many elements of Bloodstained: Curse of the Moon - a game that is inspired by older, more traditional platformers. Curse of the Moon features bosses with more cohesive, satisfying and rewarding designs, with perhaps a stronger cohesion of sound and music with the underlying gameplay. Curse of the Moon also features far more carefully developed - and downright clever - level designs that teach you to squeeze each and every control and mechanic it provides to the player to their absolute limit to allow you to get better at it.\n\nIn contrast, the game design of Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night feels clumsy, at times, easily trivialised or underwhelming depending on simply how well levelled you are or what abilities you have on you. But it does little to diminish its undeniable charm, it's wealth of content, its diversity of build options and great environment.\n\nHey, why pick?

"Bloodstained is as close a sequel to Symphony of the Night you are going to get. The game oozes the DNA of the old classic, and is chock full of callbacks and almost carbon-copied staple enemies from the PS1 game.This is a good thing! They even got the same person to do the soundtrack!\n\nHowever, not everything is perfect. The map design is terrible and the bosses are so poorly balanced that its easy to steamroll pretty much all of them. Except one or two bosses, you can practically stand in place, mash your attack and magic buttons and brute force your way into victory. Coming from a game like Hollow Knight, where each boss was a challenge of skill, this is really not acceptable. It also invalidates the importance of a very well fleshed out skill and item crafting system. Whats the point in spending time levelling your skills and items, if even the most basic versions of weapons you pick up along the way are enough to blast your way through 90% of the content?\n\nThe map design also leaves a lot to be desired, due to its immense linearity. You will often meet dead ends and when you obtain the skill you needed, you will scratch yourself wondering which of the dead ends you need to explore to continue, because there will be only ONE, and all other dead ends will leave you unable to continue. I understand this is a metroidvania staple, but games like Hollow Knight always allowed for several branches of exploration, in Bloodstained, there is only one route, if you do not follow it, you are stuck backtracking and backtracking. \n\nIts not a bad game, the combat is fun, the graphics are surprisingly good, the enemies varied, but ultimately the lack of balance and the too-tight linear design makes this game often a frustrating experience. \n\nPerhaps worth getting on a sale, but with excellent Metroidvania games like Axiom Verge, Ori, and Hollow Knight out there, I find it hard to recommend this at its full price.",Not Recommended

"For those of you who have been craving that specific Iga formula of platformer since Order of Ecclesia, this game will definitely scratch that itch. It was addictive enough to make me want to 100% it and I don't usually care about achievements at all. If you don't mind RPG elements and grinding in your metroidvanias then look no further. Exploration is very enjoyable and has the usual roadblocks that require specific skills to get past that you would expect from the genre. The castle locales are quite varied, although you can see reused assets in quite a few places and the presentation is quite rough sometimes. Most of the skills are quite unique and fun to use, so combat is always interesting even when ploughing through low level enemies later on. As for bosses, they can be as easy or as difficult as you want to make them, depending on how much you grind for shards and equipment before facing them. The main story is fairly cliché and has plenty of standard tropes, but it does enough to keep you invested and guessing what will happen next.\n\nSome areas definitely need considerable polish, such as the non-Miriam character models, weapon strength and variation within types, quest system (especially the dialogue) and some other things. However the core gameplay is so enjoyable that these negative points had almost zero impact on my enjoyment of the game, and that's what's important here.\n\nI was an early backer of Bloodstained and so got it fairly cheap, but would not begrudge paying full price for it now. Buy this game.\n\n",Recommended
"+Really good ""Castlevania"" game\n+My second favorite ""Castlevania"" game behind Symphony of The Night\n+Soundtrack is good\n+Definitely a kickstarter success\n+Love that the developers actually listen to criticism \n  They've redone the art style because of feedback\n+As for gameplay, I like that you have so many abilities and weapons to choose from\n\n- Sometimes you get lost with no clue of where to go next\n   Use that times to grind and level up\n-  It isn't clear how to get ""the good ending"" as it requires different steps to do\n\n\n",Recommended
"Okay, let's just cut right to the point here:\n\n""Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night"" is worth every penny it costs.\n\n- Fluid and Intuitive Controls\n- Fun Characters\n- MASSIVE Castle\n- Challenging Yet Fair\n\nThis game actually delivers on all the kickstarter promises that were made, and then some. Allowing for a fun time for any who loves exploration style action platformers.\n\nHowever, there is ONE thing that could use some fixing.\n\nAt a couple of points, it's easy to become lost - due to lack of direction... Of any sort. The first time occurring when you need to take a photograph to a certain character, without any indication of this - unless you constantly visit said character (which is unlikely).\n\nAnd, the second time this happens for most people - is when it comes to getting the ability to swim. Which is granted by a random enemy soul/shard, instead of being something obtained for beating a boss (aka: KILL THE GLOWING SQUID A-HOLES). The only indicator to give an idea on this, is a quest you can get - but even then, you need to manually check out the soul/shard ability while in the water, to figure out what it does.\n\nThat said, despite these two moments - the game is a blast to play. And, I would highly recommend buying it - even at full price.",Recommended
"If you liked any of the Castlevania games that weren't God of War clones, you'll enjoy Bloodstained. It's enjoyable, but it's generic, safe, bland and ultimately forgettable. \n\nThat doesn't mean it isn't 'good', per se, but it's a master class in what we should have eliminated from games years ago. Cut scenes that don't seem to understand you want to skip them, characters who barely qualify as one-dimensional, and long-winded dialog that you could outright remove in almost all situations and still get the gist of what is going on. It doesn't have to be Mass Effect 2 with multiple interesting, nuanced characters and situations, but I've been more interested in the life of a Bejeweled gem than almost any character's life and goals in this game. Any attempt to make you care about the characters is universally undermined by the fact they've acted like jerks at every opportunity to you.\n\nIt's on the short side. Going through the entire game (Good Ending) twice took just under 22 hours. At full price it's a bit of an ask for such limited content, unless you really dig farming for drops from monsters to craft anything you can, in which case you could be playing this for weeks. If you are on the fence about this, I'd wait til it hits a Steam sale. I'd recommend that even if you aren't on the fence, in fact.\n\nI enjoyed this. I'm not sorry I purchased it and gave it the time I did. I just don't think it's going to be anything anyone is talking about for long. If games are an art form, this game is a tracing of a masterpiece.",Recommended

"The way I see it, it's Castlevania the way it should have continued, but with all new characters. I was skeptical when it was announced, but I'd recommend anyone who played one of the old Metroidvanias to give it a go. After reaching the 2nd area inside the castle I knew I was going to press on.  The music, the visual design, the secrets, finding out what weapons and abilities are up your alley, it's all there. If I were to find a specific flaw, it'd be that much of the supporting cast aren't too exciting, but the main character is good enough to get behind. Will there be a sequel some day? I hope so, because I'd love to see them build on this new world!",Recommended
"An incredibly satisfying core modern Castlevania experience if you're aching for one. \n\nWhile the game does sport some balance issues, such as farming for the gold material being a pain, and certain items being far too strong for how early you get them, none of that deters from the game being thoroughly enjoyable. The soundtrack is fantastic, the game flows well, and the overall aesthetic and graphics are exactly what you expect them to be.\n\nIf you're a fan of metroidvanias, this game is an absolute must.",Recommended

This game is a perfect legacy with all the good old mechanisms from the Castlevania series had - the soul, the weapon, the item drop, the boss rush, you name it.\n\nI have to say though, only with 50+ hours and 2 play-through (the second run with all items and souls, and Hard mode), I had already completed the game with 100% collections and all achievements. It just still feels not enough for a game with such great variety of playable combinations (I literately spend lots and lots of time in exploring different souls with various weapon combinations).

"Do you love Symphony of the night, Aria of sorrow, Michiru Yamane and Koji Igarashi? Well, what are you waiting for?",Recommended
"Not many games have left as much of an impact on me as the Castlevania series. Super Castlevania IV is a personal favorite with its gothic horror atmosphere, and Symphony of the Night was such an incredible design that it spawned an entire genre. Many titles have risen to prominence in that genre since Konami chose to abdicate their command of it, but at last the progenitor has returned. Koji Igarashi, the man who made Symphony of the Night and the many similarly-styled Castlevania sequels a reality, is back with another title that is Castlevania in all but name. It’s a fantastic return to form and a clear passion project with how much detail is crammed into the game, but its held back by technical issues and an unevenness that plagued some of his weaker projects before.\n\nBefore the Industrial Revolution seized Europe with smokestacks and child labor, a horde of demons descended upon the continent. They were summoned by an order of alchemists responsible for Shardbinders, people infused with demonic crystals that could command incredible powers. Only two Shardbinders survived the invasion and subsequent purge by the church, a boy named Gebel and a woman named Miriam. Decades later, as the crystals consume their bodies, Gebel has summoned a castle of demons to threaten the entire world, and Miriam has set out to stop him. Many interested parties, alchemists and clergy and vampires among them, are caught up in this conflict, and before peace can be assured, some hard truths about the alchemists and Shardbinders must be brought to light.\n\nWe’ll get the obvious out of the way first: Bloodstained is very much an amalgamation of the last few Castlevanias to come out. Playing as Miriam, you’ll have access to shard powers which are dropped by every enemy in the game and perform all kinds of diverse functions. You’ll have shards that summon monsters, fire projectiles, can be aimed to shoot water or lasers or heads, offer you passive boosts, or grant new mobility options. These powers, along with your weapons, armors, and other items, will help you explore the vast castle and surrounding areas which include caves, towers, a town, a train, and a sailing ship. In addition to your main quest to stop Gebel (which may not be as straight-forward as it sounds), you’ll be offered tasks by survivors in town to take revenge on monsters, find specific items, and more.\n\nAll of this makes for a wide-open platformer with boatloads of options. Miriam controls with flourish and precision, allowing for careful weapon strikes, back dashes, and all kinds of aerial maneuvers. Exploring the castle is just as gratifying as it ever was, with towering cathedral halls and menacing libraries to traverse and comb for secrets. There’s a higher volume of special set pieces than in previous games, neat little interactables that open up secret passages if you have the right shard power to use on them. Really there’s more to search for in general, between the shards and weapons and armors and accessories and consumables and ingredients and upgrades. There are even bookshelves to seek out which contain bits of lore or hints at the massive special move system that exists for just about every weapon in the game.\n\nIf there’s one thing I truly adore about Bloodstained, it’s the level of loving detail that’s gone into every one of its systems. The cooking system is a prime example, because it’s something that’s often included in games as a nearly pointless afterthought. Sandwiched between synthesizing new gear and upgrading shards in your alchemy menu is the option to prepare dozens if not hundreds of dishes, from rice balls and corn soup to the finest steaks and souffles. Ingredients can be found from enemies, bought from another NPC, or literally farmed in town in the case of crops. These can be turned into more advanced ingredients like sauces and toppings, which are then combined to produce the final dish. But instead of just getting a fancy healing item for your trouble, you get a small permanent stat boost the first time you eat a new creation. And in addition to THAT, there’s an NPC on a quest to taste all kinds of rare delicacies that will reward you for fulfilling her requests.\n\nEvery system in the game has this kind of care and attention put into them. There are chairs all over the castle you can sit in, and when you do, if you have a familiar out it will go into a unique idle animation with you. If you hold up on the d-pad long enough, Miriam will start striking poses for you. All of Miriam’s gear is visible on her character except her armor, including cat ears, gas masks, and pirate hats. Every time you sit down to play, you’re likely to find another detail or reference that warms your heart. One of the big ones for me was discovering that they actually brought back the original voice actor for Alucard in Symphony of the Night for a role, one that calls back to another Symphony character in great detail. Of course, it’s also worth mentioning here that the rest of the voice cast is excellent, particularly Miriam who manages to be one of the more pleasant and interesting metroidvania protagonists in some time thanks to her performance.\n\nUnfortunately, this level of polish does not extend to the entire experience. A lot was made of the early prototypes of the game, and how much the graphics have improved since then, but there are still areas of the castle that are mostly drab brown or lacking in detail. Navigation can be a bit of a chore as well, with the castle sprawling far further than any before it and having lots of drops and remote areas that are not easy to get back to. One key point of progression actually requires you to grind a shard from a common enemy, which is a surprising departure from the normal metroidvania flow of locating new powers from specific bosses or discoveries. And I have to bring up the crashes, because I encountered three by the halfway point of the game, one of which cost me almost 20 minutes of progress.\n\nThe truth is that I love Bloodstained, I love the exploration and combat and details, but there are definite flaws that keep it from topping my lists. I can see that Iga finally got to make the game he really wanted to, full of references and homages and pure fun, and a few things went wrong along the way. I can understand not every area popping or the layout being a little weird, but the stability issues really hurt what’s an otherwise amazing game. Fans of metroidvanias… well, you already have this and finished this but for any stragglers, you can’t miss this one. And for everyone else, this could be one that helps you fall in love with the genre, if the few rough edges don’t put you off.\n\n\n\nDid you enjoy this review?

"Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night is metroidvania game heavilly inspired by Castlevania metroidvanias: Sympony of the Night, Aria of Sorrow, Dawn of Sorrow, Order of Ecclesia, etc.\nPros:\n- Art style and graphics. BROTN is 3d in 2d perspective. Very well stylised. Arguably I prefer 2d artwork, but 3d in this game looks great.\n- Music is very atmospheric and fits the game like a glove.\n- Huge amount of weapons, armor, shards(abilities). You have great variety of builds and huge room for experimentation.\nThis is what make this game different from Hollow Knight or Ori. You have less reaction based, more build-oriented gameplay.\n- Exploration is very interesting.\nCons:\n- Sometimes you are unable to pickup dropped by enemies items. They picked up automatically after sometime, but you need to wait.\n- in several moment it was unclear where to go to progress the story.\n- Quests are the same boring grindy kind as in Castlevanias. Instead of having 40 copy-pasted quests of three types, I prefer to have 4 normal quests.\nVerdict 8/10. Very nice metroidvania, practically new Castlevania game.

"Before the review I would like everyone to know that this is the first time I ever play a Castlevania-style game. Then some people would say I will not understand and appreciate the mechanics from the old games. It could be Recommended, but at the same time I also think it is a good thing because I won’t have to be biased when reviewing this game.\n\nAnd I’ll be honest to you, after putting approximate 77 hours 100% complete on normal, I have a mixed feeling about Bloodstained ROTN.\n\n[STORY & CHARACTER]\n\nStory is straight forward without complexity, which could be a good thing. However, [b]it also miss it chance to tell more about the people, the shards, the castle to change the mood in between[/b]. It does not need to be MGS talking level even though we have David Hayter here, but it could expand the game more.\n\nWith point given above, [b]the dialogue are too short as well and pretty non-existent NPC interaction.[/b] You cannot chat with Dominique, Zangetsu, the little girl and others more. In fact they will say the exact same lines for the rest 98% of the game (equals to 76 hours for me)\n\n[b]The cutscenes are very bad[/b] – they felt rushed, stiff, incomplete and emotionless\n\n[EXPLORATION]\n\n[b]You are given probably the biggest map since any Castlevania games to play around[/b]. There are many paths, secrect rooms and chests to discover. There are great variety of enemies to fight against, and you get to see many beautiful and gorgeous places inside the castle as well.\n\n[b]But it’s all fun and game till you encounter the main downside of this game – the misleading puzzle and vague hints[/b]. You won’t be able to play the last part of the game if you cannot pass the spike area using a specific item. And this item is hidden like it’s secret item that there is absolutely no hints, no talks about it. Luckily you can brute force through it, but you won’t be satisfied with this method either. Prior to that, you could be confusing dealing with things like photo, train, and underground thing despite being given hints from NPC as well. It’s simply because they are too vague, and there are even misleading rooms that you could wrongly spend hours into. Furthermore, there is no record of past lines from NPCs, so if you tend to forget things while busy exploring such huge map – and you should be – then good luck. \n\nTherefore, [b]if you cannot wander for hours with tedious “trial and error everything” in every part of the map or just read a guide, then you won’t get to see a good Recommended ending, which also means you have to stick with the cheapest, the most unsatisfied bad ending[/b]. And it even worse when you couldn’t do anything when getting this ending either, you cannot try newer difficulty, you cannot play new game plus, or do the boss rush in complete.\n\n[GAMEPLAY & BOSSES]\n\n[b]The gameplay is wonky and can be super frustrating[/b]. There are bosses I have fun and really challenge for me to put dedication into. Others are a mess because of their weird pattern, and questionable big or too big hitboxes. In addition, there is intentional delay in Miriam actions as well, and her immune time after getting hit is so short that before you could do anything she get hit again. That is even worse when enemy placement in this game is purposely touch damage spam you with numbers - for example you have just switch to the area and two bats and a frog already fly at you\n\nWhile I cannot discuss about the shard magics as I rarely use it, I think they can be pretty op like other players have said. [b]About the techniques, they are awesome to use, however, they could be clunky and risky to use too[/b]. To trigger them, you have to inputs like fighting game, yet with the same button combo pressed, some skills are easier to execute than others. For example, Trucidating Gyre is easier to play than Crimson Blizzard despite I press Down >  Left >  Right > Attack in the same timing for both. This could add more frustration when combatting enemies and even bosses. And there is even skill that very unreliable to do and pretty useless to attack enemy – Spinning Lance for example. Furthermore, the techs are divided unfairly into weapon class – 4 to 5 techs for swords and katanas, 3 for greatsword, 2 for boots and knives and just 1 for gun. \n\n[QUEST & COLLECTION & OTHERS]\n\n[b]Quests are absolutely the worst offense in this game[/b] – Basically you have to kill this monster X times, others Y times. Craft/get items and buried them down to pay respect to the dead. And prepares dishes to feed the most ungrateful and ill-bred hag I have ever seen. Why should I waste my resources, materials, and time to revenge for who I don’t know much about, to feed a hag that I f*cking hate? And everytime I see these NPCs they say the exact same thing over and over “Kill them murderers dead”, “That’s it how did you know, delicous”, “May <name> finally rest in peace now”. I cannot stand their obnoxious attitudes. And they should be grateful that this is not Skyrim, otherwise I would’ve [spoiler]ZA WARUDO[/spoiler] them to the graveyard myself.\n\n[b]The collection of weapons, armors and items are huge, but it goes a bit too far I think[/b]. I believe they overdo it because most of them are pretty much the same thing, just has higher dmg and stats. Only a few really have unique look and special effects when attacking. The most unnecessary are the “bit” weapons, too much blades weapon than guns, boots, whips, and special ones, and they are very expensive and time-consuming to craft too.\n\n[b]The grindy grind is real[/b] - You need materials to craft weapons, and each higher level weapon require the lower level one too. The same thing applied for some armors and food dishes. So you should expect to run back and forth the map, to grind mats and craft the same weapon many many times. It gets more grindy when the materials have drop rate, some can be pretty low – for instance Orichalcum with 2%, and getting it 4-5 times with LCK 100 could be tedious enough already. And worse as upgrading shards cost them materials and weapons too. Of course we could use the shop to buy things making it easier, however you need to be in the final area before you could even think of farming gold\n\n[b]Customization is great except you cannot change your outfit but color[/b]. That means hairstyle, accessories, weapon models all change and shown directly to your need. But when equipping and Flame Mail or Knight armor, you don’t get to see that which is a shame\n\n[b]New game + offer nothing new but quick revenge chance[/b] Basically you can use your most op weapons, magics and techs to cheese all previous boss and earn medal easily, and Nightmare cannot stop you either. If you want challenge, you will have to start fresh again\n\n[b]Speedrun & Boss rush just to extend your playtime a bit more[/b] Boss rush is quite easy since it is based on your save level and items. Speedrun, too obvious.\n\n[b]And there is no unlocked artworks, concept, cutscenes, model viewing or any other mode, probably we will have to wait for DLCs[/b]\n\n[PERFORMANCE]\n\n[b]Graphics are stunning if we do not talk about cutscenes, the audio and soundtrack are perfect, really nail the theme, the place of main game[/b]\n\n[b]Performance is fairly smooth, however it is not maximum optimized since there are couple drops in some places, even with the lowest setting. And the load time may be inconsistent sometimes[/b]\n\n[FINAL THOUGHT]\n\nSo is it a Castlevania spiritual successor? I believe it is because it nails the feeling, the exploration. However, it does not surpass them or evolve itself while it has potential, instead it get dragged down because of wonky combat, major progression issue due to misleading puzzle and hints, mediocre dialogs and  boring questlines. \n\nThen score is 7 at max, and when it has serious issue with progression it dropped to mixed 5 or 6.

Maybe it'd be better if this game had 2D graphics, but it honestly looks quite well anyway...and most importantly the gameplay is an absolute masterpiece.\n11/10 would wait another 4 years for this quality.",Recommended
"This game is amazing, I absolutely love it. This is like my new favorite game. All the floors and skills you can learn there is just so much content. You could probably play this game over multiple times and have a different experience every time.  The backtracking fits and it doesn't get annoying the enemies vary across all the different areas and nothing really seems lazy or recycled. The weapons are great. I found an 8bit coin early in the game and it let's you make a unique weapon for practically free. The nice thing is that you can keep that weapon and keep upgrading it. The cosmetics are awesome and all the little nifty things you can do truly add to this masterpiece of a game. One of the coolest things I found in the game are accessories that boost your damage based on how many enemies you kill, how much of the map you've explored etc.\nOne thing that I have found rather odd though is I fought the last boss and it was over the top easy. I think I'm missing something because my map was only around 50 percent complete when doing so and there wasnt really an ending. It just kind of said, hey you're done and toom me to the title screen. But I'm stoked to still play because I love this game and anymore reason to play it, is fine with me.",Recommended
"If you enjoy any of the other ""IgaVania"" games then you should be compelled to purchase this game.  I've played & beaten nearly every Igavania title that exists.  Multiple times.  I fire up Symphony of the Night 1-2 times a year and do a full play through.  This is such a wonderful 2.5D game!  I love the art style, the weapons/abilities are fun...it's just a really well rounded Iga game.  I snatched it up as soon as it was available on Steam and have not regretted it yet.  I can't wait for future updates, as of this writing I'm already 44 hours in.",Recommended
I’m addicted to this game💓,Recommended
"A worthy successor to Symphony of the Night and the NDS Castlevania games. Movement and combat feels fluid, there are so many different weapons and spells for you to develop your own playstyle. As a nod to SotN, getting the ""good"" ending requires you to solve a puzzle during a boss fight, although there are plenty of hints given to you.\n\nThe overall artwork and presentation is solid for a Kickstarter game. The soundtrack in particular is wonderful with several memorable tunes still stuck in my head.\n\nNote: for those with experience in Iga-vanias and 2D action platformers, I highly recommend starting on Hard mode in your first fresh playthrough, as Normal might be too easy. To unlock Hard mode from the start, you need to input NIGHTMARE as your player name when you select New Game (you can change your name back later).",Recommended
"In it's current state and price, I just cannot recommend this game based on my experience. The first half of this game is very solid, well thought out and feels very good to play, but the second half of the game feels very rushed and predictable. basically [spoiler] the girl helping you the whole time is the main villain for no well thought out reason, you can see it coming from miles away and it leaves a real bad taste in the mouth. [/spoiler] I found myself hating the game in the final acts because of how easy the bosses were and how nonexistent the plot was. Another problem I have with this game is the postgame content, after you beat the main story the game offers ""New Game+"" which is the most barebones form of the gamemode I've seen in years. \n\nOverall the combat is fluid and responsive, but the story and progression is very lackluster, and the gameplay loop gets boring after a few hours.

More sidequests would have been awesome.

"This game can be completed in around 12+ hours. Add or double the hours if you want the completion achievements(or use some help with the grind) \n\nThis is a Metroidvania game. It feels close to old school games than recent ones like HK(Hollow Knight). For comparison sake i think HK is still a better game but this game still ticks the right boxes. As for difficulty I think HK is harder due to having no items like healing potions to use during a fight.\n\nThe only real complaint i have for this game is the needless complexity and grind you need to do for your items and upgrades. Exploration, Quests and story are all decent. I had to use a Trainer just to remove the feeling of grind that is hampering my enjoyment for the game. \n\n\nPros\n- Different endings(Caught me by surprise)\n- Regional Pricing! in Humble Store after they increased the price in Steam(like Why?)\n- Decent length\n- Enjoyable exploration with mostly directed hints on progression(better than HK anyway)\n\nCons\n- Grinding for exp, money and items is too time consuming\n- Though it is still part of the pro section majority of them game there are 2 instances where you are left completely without a clue on what to do\n",Recommended

"This is a FANTASTIC game, probably the best Metroidvania game ever.  It hits all the points that made Symphony of the Night fantastic, and then just adds so much more on top of that.  There were a couple minor bugs I ran into, mainly visual, though one of them was fairly irritating.  If you slide (by pressing down and jump) into water, you won't be able to jump out of the water.  If you do this where there is no ramp to walk out of the water, and you haven't yet retrieved a shard that lets you move below the surface of the water, you could end up stuck having to reset.  A waystone will get you out, but if you don't have one, you're kinda boned.  Besides that though, the gameplay is amazing. They even include the same sort of timing ""bugs"" that are really features, like swinging your weapon just before landing from a jump to avoid the weapon's ""backswing"" animation, and using the same trick with the backstep. The controls are very precise, so I can forsee a long future of speedruns for this game.",Recommended

"Watched SGDQ 2019 recently and saw Order of Ecclesias being speed-run; was quite the nostalgia trip, since I remember that game fondly.  Then I turned around and played more Bloodstained.  It was great how much of the feel has been so faithfully retained.  \n\nYes, there are a few rough spots.  The art aesthetic isn't quite as unified as the DS entries.  However, the feel and the mechanics are just spot on.  As for the difficulty spikes?  It's all part of the legacy.  Previous IgaVanias had no hesitations about smashing your face into its Baroque walls.\n\nLove the details in the myriads of weapons and figuring out each of their little quirks.  I got to try basically every weapon type through the course of the game.  Honestly didn't figure I would enjoy greatswords as much as I did, and even more surprised by how robust the gun builds could be in the late game if you invest in it. \n\nGreat job Team Iga!",Recommended

"It's a great Castlevania-esque game made by the guy who actually made the classic Castlevania games. If you've those games before, you'll master this game in a flash. The main attraction of this game are definitely the bosses. Smart players will need to use all available skills and techniques to defeat them. Too bad I'm not a good enough gamer to that, though. I just bulldoze myself through. It's actually the main reason why I can't beat the last boss, therefore can't finish playing the game. Thanks God for YouTube and Let's Players lol",Recommended
"Really great game! Retains that classic Symphony of the Night feel, as I expected. And it does more. My only gripe is that it doesn't have native 21:9 support. I am aware of the mod but it stretches certain aspects and I don't like that. Other than that, it's a stellar game!",Recommended
"It is unequivocally an Igavania game. Imagine a game that has all the best parts of Symphony of the Night and all the GBA and DS Castlevanias smashed together in a sometimes awkward package, that is this game. Sometimes the graphics are a little average but sometimes they're great. Seems to depend on the level: for me Hall of Termination was best in appearance followed by Livre Ex Machina. \n\nThe gameplay, however, is robust and is what one would expect from this type of game. A lot of ways to level your character--from just leveling Miriam up, farming and leveling the Shards, crafting better gear, and even food has a play on your character's stats. The results being that you will have a fast moving Miriam that shreds rooms of enemies and has near instant MP recovery as reward for collecting and actually trying out different things. There is appearance customization with a decent selection to choose from: hair styles (most that you find throughout the castle), hair color, skin color, eye color, and even the color of Miriam's original dress.\n\nLots of fun in this game. There are a ton of call backs to the past Castlevania games, like the library chair launch and other little jokes aside. I especially liked the metal rocking demon you find in Livre Ex Machina. And there is one secret, somewhat short, level but it's witty and I won't spoil it. This game has the same type of quirkiness that Igavanias are known for but tenfold.\n\nIn all I recommend this game to anyone that enjoyed Koji Igarashi's work on the Castlevania series, since this game very much feels like his love letter to the series. I dare say it's his finest work although SoTN still holds a special place.\n\nOne last thing: ""EEEEE UUUUUUUU!!""   You'll understand once you play the game.\n",Recommended
"Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night is an enjoyable, decently paced Metroidvania. As a metroidvania, it starts out with plenty of opportunities to explore, from exploring the map to experimenting with your arsenal. As you progress, you can equip and use powers from ""Shards,"" which open up more opportunities for exploration and dealing with enemies. Aside from the main quest, the game provides plenty of opportunities to take on additional side quests, usually slaying creatures or acquiring a specific item for a person. As an added touch, you can also create items and food to heal yourself and gain an extra boost.\n\nI recommend this game if you:\n- Enjoy games with exploration.\n- Like to play a game where you can use a variety of skills.\n- Enjoy platformers.\n\nI don't recommend this game if you:\n- Don't enjoy platformers\n- Don't like moments where you feel lost.",Recommended

After the first boss, the game increases the difficulty quite a bit until the player learns new abilities or upgrades their gear. \n\nGetting past that, the game is a breath of fresh air, and a scratch to that castlevania itch that I've felt since SOTN. The gameplay is sound, the equipment and quests addictive, the powers absurdly fun to mess around with, and the characters have a charm all their own.\n\nAdd to the fact that we're apparently looking forward to a plethora of new DLC (13 in total, I hear), including new playable characters, and even some form of multiplayer?

However that aside it is a very fun game and exploreing is great. Alot of issues i had were quickly resolved as the game progresses. Music is great, combat is fun, references everywhere (hold up on the d-pad while idle, and yes that is A reference), some really nice QOL features, like a temp-save funtion so you dont need to reach a save room if ya need to do something else/stop playing and finaly some nice customization options. Overall its a great game, worth ya time, price may be alittle high for some but personaly i would say its worth it.",Recommended
It's so worth the full price that I bought three copies.\n\nThis game is the real deal. If you like Castlevania: Symphony of the Night then you should really get this.,Recommended
"This is an absolutely adorable Castlevania replacement. Beautiful music, really fun gameplay and exactly what you're looking for if you adored the GBA and DS Castlevanias. I'm guessing all the reviews already said this, but I do want to mention a few things which I did not like, so maybe one of these days we might get another one of these, and they can be even better. What follows will be a bit negative, but don't misunderstand me, this is a splendid video game and you should definitely buy this thing.\n\nThere's sidequests, like in Order of Ecclesia, which revolve around walking around the map and grinding enemies until you get the right materials for something. I think this is really not too enjoyable. You can only really do these quests efficiently in the endgame when you've got great movement skills and stomp every monster, but even then, you might have to leave and re-enter the same room for like ten minutes until you get the right materials, even with maxed out luck. I did this for a while, but towards the last few quests I just didn't feel like putting up with it anymore. And hiding some of the materials in the blue chests which only respawn after an amount of time is just oof. Need fucking fife thousand bottles of soy sauce which never show up anywhere.\n\nI don't think sidequests can't have a part in Castlevania, but I'd love them to be a bit more creative. Killing enemies or bosses under certain conditions, with a certain weapon, in a certain time, carrying something from A to B without getting hit. Stuff like that I think could be really sweet. The currently existing sidequests, while Recommended to at least one original Castlevania, I feel do not add a lot of value to the game (especially since all NPCs permanently use the same dialogue whenever you finish any of the quests). \n\nI can't really find any other really big things which bugged me except that a few of the bosses in the midgame felt kinda unimpressive (but a lot of the later ones were really cool!) and the buyable equipment was so expensive that I never bought anything until all the way at the end of the game, when I didn't really need anything anymore anyway. \n\nSome improvements here and there could make this whole thing into an even more amazing experience.

"[h1]Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night is more of a Castlevania SotN & Dawn of Sorrow combined.[/h1] \n\nNot the biggest fan of the crafting mechanic. Discovering rare drops feels much more satisfying than grinding for materials in my opinion. Seeing powerful equipments being sold by the Little kid in the shop or offered to be crafted by Johannes doesn't exactly make it feel like it's a rare thing and kinda stumps on the discovery-adventure feel of the game.\n\nI/We have expected an inverted castle so that there would be double the enemies, bosses (Galamoth) and rare drops. They did give us an inverted castle as a skill, which feels like a scam. It is needed to be used in some instances, but later on it kinda feels unneeded and redundant to ultra high jump. \n\nThe final boss fight is rather weak and forgettable. It is exactly like fighting Shaft and Death without ever fighting Dracula's final form, which makes it feel like a incomplete game.\n\nMy minor gripe with the main character, her stance, movement and especially death looks animation stiff when compared to Alucard (SotN). \n\nThere are other factors which I forgot to add here. But, I think other fans who have completed SotN or these type of games can also feel that there are stuff lacking.\n\nAll that said, it's  fine given that this game has already been delayed for 4 years(?). They certainly did a fine job in executing this game. The current mechanics and decisions are still fine. This is a good homage to Castlevania SotN & Dawn of Sorrow. \n\nPS: I just wish(hope) that they would give an actual continuation to the complete the story as either free DLC or Expansion.",Recommended

"One of the best games I've played in awhile. It basically combines the gameplay of SOTN and Aria of Sorrow, which I consider to be the best ""Igavania"" games in the series. If this game actually was a Castlevania, I would rank it closely behind SOTN, but dangerously close. Much more content is on the way too, which gives it the chance to go on par or even surpass it. That's something I thought I would never say in my life considering SOTN is in my top 10 games of all time. Bosses have also been challenging too, especially the bloodless boss fight. Took me six tries before I was able to kill it. Soundtrack is amazing too. The Item shop theme and holy wisdom have especially been playing in my head for the past few days. Even the music that plays when you're taking on sidequests is memorable. I haven't beaten the game yet, but from how it's been so far, if it keeps up the pace it's been going, I can forsee myself replaying this many times in the future.",Recommended

"On screen keyboards work fine. But there's an option in the menus you might want to turn off if you're using one to play ""Mouse Menu Input"". That will stop the mouse movements scrolling through the menus.\n\nIf you're using a keyboard, you will want to configure the controls a little, but otherwise it seems to be okay.\n\nAs for the game itself, it's a lot of fun, with what little I've played so far. Feels like a combination of Symphony of the Night, Aria of Sorrow and Order of Ecclesia. (Those are all Castlevania games. No relation to this at all, cough cough)\n\nGranted I've only just gotten started, and just wanted to point out that on screen keyboards work. I will update this review more once I've played it.\n\nUpdate:\nRight. I've now completed the game on normal. I will do hard at some point soon.\nI really enjoyed it. Aside from a few spelling errors and bugs that made items unlootable (Leaving the area gave me those items.) The game is in really good quality.\n\nThe game has many places to explore and is indeed very similar to Aria of Sorrow. You don't have to find all the villagers like in Order of Ecclesia, but there are quests you can do for them. Kill X amount of enemies, cook food, obtain items. Most are relatively easy to obtain if you're like me and smacking every wall along the way in case it's a hidden wall. (You get something to help with that later on.)\n\nI've not played Symphony of the Night (I'm trying to find it, I'm not good at emulating. Sorry. I will... I know it's pretty bad of me not to have played it.) But I hear it's similar to this, and that makes me want to play that one really badly. \n\nDon't be afraid to google advice as well, as some things can be a little mystifying to find your way round. More notable around 3 quarters through the game. Other than that, you should be fine. If you need help with anything specific, feel free to comment on this review, and I will try to help.\n\nThe game is relatively short, unless you like to collect things. But if you don't like to collect things, one has to ask why you want to play a Castle, ahem, Bloodstained game. The game is easy for the most part if you make it easy. Minmaxxing and stuff is very possible and you can basically become unstoppable... However.\n\nOn hard mode, the enemies do double damage... that it? No, the bosses have extra mechanics. So that will amp it up a bit I'm sure... then there's a nightmare mode. So if you like a challenging game, I'm sure you'll get it from that. Never fear!\n\nI prefer a more laid back game that still manages to feel rewarding, and I certainly got that from this.\n\nEither way, if you buy it, I know you will, but I hope you have fun. Thank Iga in any way you can. I sadly could not be a backer(Due to not knowing about the game), but I bought the DLC (Which is basically backer rewards, because exclusivity sucks and Iga is awesome!) and the soundtrack.

"Very  POOR  difficulty design, but still amazing game\n\nI really DO NOT want to recommend this game because of the messed up difficulty design, but this game is so good that I have to recommend.\n\nI need to say some about the difficulty balance.\n\nIt is messed up not because it is too easy for default ""normal"" difficulty but because  the  more you level up your gears the less fun you will have.  I beat all bosses just by standing in front of them and hitting repeatedly ( include OD ) , except the  first time Zangtsu and Bloodless I need jump around a little bit.\n\nIn the second half of the game I never feel any kind of intensity or need of focus. The more I leveled up my gears the less I feel caring about the ""playing"" of the game, all I care was about collecting.\n\nAt the end of the game of first run, I got all 100% and became god. For the second run, the bosses can not stand for 5 second even it is in the hard model because I leveled up everything. \n\nAll bosses and monsters become meaningless, I can autopilot everywhere. \n\nSO, I got punished by 100% everything, I am not happy with that \n\nThat is very unbalanced design. I will give examples what is balanced difficulty design: Monster Hunter, Hollow Knight, Cup Head, Fire Emblem.\n\nYes, these are different type of games but they all have something in common. You almost feel the same difficulty through the whole game no matter what you do. So you can feel challenged, so you have to focus on ""playing"" the game. \n\nBut in this game is like: ""em, whatever, I need 5 more that"" \n\n",Recommended

The sound is also as good as the the rest. \nYes, the story is not breathtaking and the character are okay, but still good enough.\n\nWhat really suprised me are the very, very motivating loot, level and crafting mechanics! There are plenty of weapons and magics that can be looted or crafted. Some can even be upgraded. And each weapon feels different, it's not just about the stats.\n\nSo even without a retro romatic vision I can strongly recommend this title to anyone who is into games like Hollow Knight, Ori or other Metrovanias.",Recommended
"[url=https://kinglink-reviews.com/2019/07/13/bloodstained-ritual-of-the-night-review/] Full Review[/url] --  [url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/31803828-Kinglink-Reviews/] Curator Site [/url]\n\nVideo Review: \nhttps://youtu.be/4Klcr9-uCp0\n\nBloodstained: Ritual of the Night started as a Kickstarter in May of 2015, claiming to bring a new game from Koji Igarashi, creator of Castlevania: Symphony of the Night and was funded in under 24 hours and went on to be one of the largest Kickstarters of all time earning over five million dollars. It’s been over 4 years since then, it finally was released, but has it delivered on its promise?\n\nIt’s taken almost twice as long as expected, but the end result is very interesting, and we’ll break it down. The fact is Kickstarters, in general, have an unknown quality to them. Whether it’s failure to launch, like Code Hero, games that are unimpressive such as Mighty No. 9, the number of them that are now moving to Epic Game Store at the last minute, or games that are good, such as Timespinner, or just games that come out entirely too late, it’s become almost a minefield for video games. The question is can Bloodstained become the one game that avoids those pitfalls? Perhaps.\n\n[h1]Graphics[/h1]\nBloodstained: Ritual of the Night looks great from the first moment. The first area of the game is a ship sailing over unknown water. This was the original demo level for the game and was fantastic at that time. While it didn’t give much away, the look and feel of the level really worked. It is still the opening level of the game, and it combines all those great elements together, allowing the player to explore the galleon at their own pace and reveal in some amazing looking graphics.\n\nEvery level in Bloodstained is reminiscent of this design. Each area and room evokes an interesting feeling and a memorable sign. A number of times I had to backtrack through levels to find something, and each level stands out so well it’s easy to find your path through them without opening the map in each room. The look of each area though stands out in quality as well as style.\n\nThe enemies in Bloodstained are well designed and interesting. However, there is a definitely “Castlevania” flavor to them, going as far as having Dullahammer heads flying around similar to the Medusa heads of the Castlevania games. In fact, if you’ve never seen the enemies of Castlevania, I would say that you’ll see most of them in Bloodstained, and it’s a good start.\n\nOf course, Bloodstained does push beyond the past and create all new horrors for the player. In fact, the one that stands out for me is the disembodied head of dogs that bounce around on a leash, or cats that can swipe at players. The enemies contain everything from Ninja assassins, guitarists, shovel knight, and more as well as having a strange and macabre design. One downside is that with so many various designs to the enemy quite a few areas feel a bit random, but at the same time, having different challenges thrown at the player in a different order does keep the player on edge.\n\nThere were a number of Kickstarter goals that definitely influenced the game. A number of backers were able to be placed as portraits in the game, which works extremely well, in fact, there’s a portrait I adore of one backer’s cat. But I also am curious of how many of the enemies that I found out of place were from different backer’s wishes, or in general how much the Kickstarter process affected the game.\n\nThough I do find parts of the Kickstarter rewards interesting. The devs included a number of voice lines from David Hayter, and Robbie Belgrade in the game, and those are enjoyable to play through.\n\nUnfortunately, not everything works in Bloodstained, there are a number of characters who talk to our main character, Miriam, in the main village of the game, and the character models here really look out of place for Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night. It’s a strange piece that I’m unsure why they weren’t improved over time.\n\nSimilarly, a couple of areas stand out as just not being as original as other parts of the game, or features that weren’t fully used. After the boat ride, the second area of the game has an amazing 90-degree turn in it as the player runs to the right. It’s a bit of visual trickery but it stands out. However, it’s one of only four rooms in the entire game that uses this trick. A major boss battle occurs in a circular room, as does an epic fight, and a couple of areas, but it’s used so sparingly I’m not sure if it could have done more or is just a one-off trick.\n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\nThe story of Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night is strange. I struggled with the story, and even replayed the opening three times, just to ensure I wasn’t missing a scene or two. Unfortunately, the Bloodstained opening is a little all over the place.\n\nThe story starts by telling you about previous experiments behind done on “Shardbinders” most of which died, leaving only the character of Gebel, who survived the experiment, and Miriam who had fallen into a ten-year slumber. It’s very quick and rather lacking opening. From there, Miriam’s friend Johannes is assisting here and bringing her to a castle where they meet Gebel, who seems to be controlled by a mythical being called Gremory, and a church agent called Dominique. From here the castle is open for the player to explore.\n\nThroughout the game, it feels like Bloodstained is trying to piece much of its story together. There are a number of characters introduced such as Zangetsu a sword-wielding samurai and Alfred as an old mage. Zangetsu is actually played by David Hayter, and it’s such a thrill to hear his voice again in the game, even if it does sound a bit like a cross between a swordsman and Snake from Metal Gear Solid, it’s a great performance. All the characters are well voiced.\n\nFrom these characters, I could have sworn that this game was a sequel to Bloodstained: Curse of the Moon. However I don’t believe this is the case, and in fact, it seems Curse of the Moon is based on an alternate universe, and as such, I have a major problem.\n\nThe game seems to imply you should already know some or a decent amount of this story, but if Bloodstained: Curse of the Moon is a different game, there’s no backstory to already know. Even if there is a backstory, it should be included with this game so players get a full experience, rather than grasp at the weak opening with its numerous plot holes.\n\nAfter the odd opening of the game, Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night does have a decent story. Zangetsu and Alfred have met a couple of times and both characters have their own reasons for exploring the castle. There’s a lot to explore and discover in the game, and in fact, I liked the story more as I got to the end of the game, as pieces of the original story eventually got filled in. However, if this was intentional, the opening could have been more fleshed out and these reveals would have been more impactful rather than leaving holes that the player would expect to have some explanation even if it’s an incorrect or an unknown gap.\n\nIf you want to read more and see a final score, you can see the full review with pictures and video at\nhttps://kinglink-reviews.com/2019/07/13/bloodstained-ritual-of-the-night-review/.

"TO TEMPORARILY FIX THE OFF MONITOR PROBLEM PUT GAME IN WINDOWED OR BORDERLESS AND HIT WIN + SHIFT + THE DIRECTION OF THE OTHER MONITOR\n\n-Review-\n\nI want to niggle- it needs a day one patch, the monitor issue, sometimes controls are a little chunky... then I get a sword and it cuts an enemies head clean off or I find a ""vania"" style secret. I just can't.\n\nThe game is everything you wanted in a new castlevania, and I'm so sorry I slept on it for a month waiting for the patch. \n\nIt's that good and you should be playing it. Buy it at full price, sale, it doesn't matter. You're gonna have such a good time.",Recommended
"So glad I backed this game for $125! Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night is my new favorite game!\nBloodstained is a collect-a-thon of the best variety, getting unique ""shards"" from almost every single enemy in the game (including bosses) makes every kill feel worthwhile, and every playthrough feel unique.\nWhile side quests can at time feel a bit grindy, along with some of the achievements, they do a great job of forcing players to acquire permanent power-ups that they might otherwise ignore.\nThe story is a bit run of the mill and at times predictable, but the gameplay more than makes up for it. My only wish is that the story would go deeper, I wish bookshelves would contain more backstory and lore based on how much of the game you've completed, making achievement hunting a bit more interesting. \nOverall, Bloodstained checks every mark I look for in a game. It's a bit hard to run, but even on lower graphic settings it looks great. I would highly recommend this game to fans of the Metroidvania genre!",Recommended
"In 20 years, people are gonna remember this game not for the amazing world design or abundance of secrets...Rather, they'll remember it because the Twin Dragon Tower looks like something out of a bad Unity asset flip and because Zangetsu is voiced by Solid Snake.",Recommended
"Strongly recommend this game. Bloodstained caught me off guard as I had never heard of it, but it is a great love letter to the early Castlevanias that has been modernized and well polished. Lots to explore and collect with a wide range of combat styles means great replayability. \n\n[b]The Good:[/b]\n· Combat is tight and feels very responsive. Each weapon family (Guns, whips, swords, spears etc...) has several skills that can be learned on one weapon before it is shared among similar weapons\n· Lots of collectables and crafting. The crafting feels naturally implemented and doesn't get in the way of the primary focus of the game\n· The soundtrack. I caught myself humming parts of the soundtrack several times after finishing my first playthrough.\n\n[b]The Okay:[/b]\n· The quest system. The quests given by the villagers feel a little awkwardly implemented. Some are finished naturally through the course of the playthrough, but others turn into a slog of you crafting requested items near the end of the game.\n· Knowing where on earth to go. There were several instances where there could have been more context clues or breadcrumbs left in order to help guide to what the next progression step is. [spoiler] Equipping the Aegis armor after receiving the invert ability [/spoiler] is something I don't think I would have figured out on my own.\n\n[b]The Bad:[/b]\n· The plot. Apparently all the effort of putting context clues in was put in the plot. The game manages to beat you over the head with so much foreshadowing to their endgame twist that it's borderline obnoxious. Forgettable story, but that's not why I play this game.",Recommended

"I have never left a review here on Steam for any game, but this one is special. I am a guy who is still very angry that Konami basically threw Castlevania aside and have been waiting for this game for a very long time. I am very pleased to say that this game takes everything great from Castlevania games and throws it into one awesome package! In a nutshell, this game is basically what you would get if Symphony of the Night and Aria of Sorrow had a child.\n\nJust finished the game after pouring 70 hours into one playthrough completing everything and am fully ready to go back and play it again on New Game + on a higher difficulty.

"This game is VERY Castlevania, but thats about it. It's everything you would expect, plus tons of fanservice. This game doesn't reinvent the wheel with anything it does which is unfortunate because I feel like they really could have made this game something special like Symphony of the Night.\nIt's a good game, but not a great game.",Recommended
"Was being a fan since Symphony of the Night, and played every single Castlevania game on GBA and NDS. Bloodstained is truly a dream come Recommended for the game lovers like me.\n\nIt would be better if the difficulty is adjustable in game. I farmed almost everything and nothing could have a chance standing in front of me. I wish I could adjust the difficulty from normal to a harder one.",Recommended
"What I realized while playing this game is that I don't actually specifically like metroidvanias as a genre, it's just that I like metroidvanias that allow me to level and grind enough that I can facetank any boss I meet and finish the battle before they use their third attack pattern. The 61 hours I currently have is just one playthrough on just normal. This game does not take 61 hours on normal. I think it takes less than 25 maybe? But if you're unskilled like me or find it hard to react to attack pattern telegraphs, you can just farm everything and finish half the bossfights in maybe a minute each.\n\n\nSo if you like SOTN, and/or grinding then pick this up. It's not revolutionary or anything but it will be more of something you like, and that's guaranteed satisfaction and sometimes that's enough.\n\n\nCouple of Positives: Shard system is nice for on demand ""spell casting"" instead specific button inputs, crafting and cooking is a nice touch and provides decent bonuses if you bother with them\n\n\nCouple of negatives: the shard swapping can be annoying sometimes, and the loot can have this tendency to get stuck on terrain and you have to stand beside it and wait for the bag to despawn before you can get the item.\n\n\nAnyway, remember to mark chests you can't reach yet on the map. It'll come in handy.",Recommended

"amazing so far, great story, beautiful music, gameplay is outstanding, it really does feel almost identical to sotn as far as movement and feel of gameplay, its strange but in a good way, its been years since i played sotn and i saw a bunch of people saying this game was very similar so i gave it a shot, they were right\n\nthe further i get in this game the better it gets, everything from music to gear to map this game is on par if not better than sotn, and i just bought that on psn today to compare",Recommended
"Ritual of the Night is an amazing game. Controls are pretty great and the gameplay is fun. A large variety of spells lets you choose what is funnest for you. A lot of the spells are very similar in function they just look different. This game has a lot of things to collect, items, weapons, recipes that give permanent buffs, lots of armor and accessories too. Music is great. The game runs really well. Overall a very positive gaming experience, would highly recommend.",Recommended
10/10!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,Recommended
"It's good, really good.\nI'm not Metroidvania crazy, but this game got me hooked pretty early on.\nStory is good enough to keep you engaged, with okay to good voice acting (played with English VO).\n\nAudio levels are a bit weird at first. The main menu is louder than the rest of the game, and the intro narrator is a bit too quiet.\n\nAs you would expect from a title like this, the potential to get stuck due to a certain skill you lack and have no idea how to acquire is pretty high.\nFor the most part, characters will give you good hints on what to do next, but there's one particular case where that doesn't happen and the only way to proceed is to get a certain item that a normal enemy randomly drops.\n\nThe game doesn't look very impressive from a graphics standpoint, but that comes with the perk of running very smoothly even on weak hardware.\n\nI recommend this game to people who want a more old school experience, without any handholding by the game.",Recommended

"Very impressed.  Solid metroidvania, and some really good ideas.  Getting shards off enemies to grant new attacks is great, though the couple you must farm to progress are stupid (they should be a guaranteed drop).  I definitely got stuck a few of times (counting the farmed shards, as I would not have thought you'd need a random drop to proceed.  Outside of this, the combat is great the variety of weapons and playstyles is really high.  The side-quests are beg-standard, but none take very long, and are easy to knock out while playing.  Very little negatives honestly, this is easily a must-buy if you like metroidvanias.",Recommended
"If you are a Symphony of the Night fan, this is a must buy.",Recommended
"Despite me being a 90s kid and playing a lot of old school games, I pretty much missed the era of ""Metroidvania/Igavanias"" starting from 1997 and on.  I moved on to other game types and was still playing online bulletin board systems and whatnot.\n\nI backed this game, however, because this was during a brief period where Kenji Inafune made gangbusters off of a successfully Kickstarted Mighty No. 9 project.  Of course, that one turned out to be a complete failure.  Iga, however, was the original creator of the SOTN series, and after watching gameplay of it and reading up on a lot of peoples' stories about it, I decided to back it.\n\nI then completely forgot about it for years until a few months before its release.\n\nYou ever listened to an old piece of music, despite being born after the music was made yet it made you nostalgic for a time you never experienced?\n\nThat's what this game is.  The game really feels like it took the 1997-era of game design and transporteitself to 2019.  I won't talk about the story too much, as others have gone over it, but gameplay wise it felt like I was a kid in high school again.  Very little hand holding, lots of exploration, save rooms that heal you - dozens of weapon types to choose from, tons of special moves, lots of shards (which are essentially special abilities) you can equip and level, and an RPG-lite stat system is so well made.  The need to complete everything encourages you to move everywhere and explore every nook and cranny.  Chests will be just out of reach, making you want to explore maps even more to figure out how to get to them.  You will run into all sorts of areas that will have items and paths that you won't be able to get to until you get abilities later on in the game that will let you access those areas.\n\nThe game has a few bugs here and there that keeps it from earning a 10/10 rating.  There will be nooks and crannies where your character will get stuck in a ""ducking"" pose and you won't be able to get out unless you slide out.  Items will drop that you cannot pick up (it will stay as a bag).  Some enemies are so ""light"" hard they get knocked off the map and never return.  The English text has typos and missing words/spaces.  I also wish this game used a better in-game font - a Serif font considering how gothic-themed it is.\n\nThere's also three MAJOR progression points where you will get stuck.\n[spoiler]1) There is a part where you need to access a train. You need to get a picture taken of yourself and then give that picture to a particular character to get the item needed to board the train.  The game gives you almost *no* hints about this and you may spend hours running around the entire area trying to find a way to progress.\n2) In order to unlock a majority of the game and get the ""good"" ending, you will need a special skill/shard that is an RNG drop from a random enemy.  The game gives you absolutely no clues or any kind of inference that these enemies are what you have to kill, and the problem is these enemies do not give you the item needed to progress all the time, so it is very likely you will miss it.\n3) To access a specific area that is also near the last quarter of the game, you will need a particular item.  The item is hidden away and *very* easy to miss.  If you do not know about the existence of the item (and you won't in your first playthrough) you *will* miss it.  Again, no clues or inferences by the game to go get the item or where the item is.  You will most likely have to comb through the ENTIRE game and then some just to get the item to get past this area.\n[/spoiler]\n\nOutside of those glaring ""90s hard"" design flaws, this is definitely a successful release.  Many praises to Iga for seeing this project through.",Recommended
"Did you like Symphony of the Night? Yes? Then you'll like this.\n\nThere's a handful of technical issues and a few spots where the path forward is a bit opaque, but that's why wikis exist if you truly get stuck. Otherwise, I'm very pleased that I backed this game.",Recommended
Symphony Of The Night but with cute anime wifus. 10/10.,Recommended
"Starts out strong, loads of exploration, combat, abilities. Sadly the game falls off once you get more abilities and further explore the castle as you see repeated enemies, non-rewarding exploration and weak power ups.\nAlso most boss fights range from mediocre to extremely bad, since bosses have very little variation in their moves, the final boss fight is notably terrible as it only has like 6 different attacks while having tons of HP, so the fight ends up dragging on and being boring.\nStill, it's not a bad game, and if you've been waiting for another SoTN style castelvania, this game can fill that void now that konami has ditched the series.",Recommended

"[h1]Great Game; Needs Polish[/h1]\n\nFull Disclosure: I have not played a Castlevania game since Super Castlevania and even that I only played a few years ago. Also I played Bloodstained primarily on Hard mode and recommend everyone start out on that difficulty.\n\nPros:[list]\n[*]Lots of fun abilities and weapons to play around with, most of which are reasonable powerful enough to rely on for a playthrough. Some even have surprising nuances to master.\n[*]Said variety leads to massive replayability. There are many playstyles to try out.\n[*]Lots of character customization\n[*]A reasonable challenging game once the right difficulty is set.\n[/list]\n\nCons:[list]\n[*]Not enough difficulty unless you use a cheat code.\n[*]Lack of solid end game content. You'll have many OP abilities, but few opportunities to really go wild.\n[*]Lots of mild flaws that need polishing, such as hit box adjustments, lag spikes and maybe a balance update.\n[*]Early game weapons lack punch and take a while to start getting good. The 8 bit weapons are cool with custom effects, but quickly fall off in damage until you can pay the steep fee for the damage upgrade.\n[*]Bosses are on the weaker end aside from the early game bosses.\n[*]All of these combined begin to cut into the massive replayability that Bloodstained otherwise demands.\n[/list]\n\nMany of these flaws will be addressed in upcoming patches and future DLC, so expect this review to age poorly. Nevertheless, it's a fun solid game.",Recommended

"Bloodstained is very close to the game I was hoping it would be.  Is it nostalgic…yes…is it great…yes!  Do I wish it was better…yes.  A lot is really good about the game.  I actually relished the visuals.  I thought the mix of 2d and 3d did actually work, I enjoyed the movement of my character, the wide variety of spells and weapons were great.  I felt the game had a bunch of fun secrets and the map was quite large and a joy to explore.  \n\nHowever, the story was a real let down for me.  Maybe I just have too rose colored memories of Symphony of the Night, but I remember the story being so much stronger.  I remember constantly running into characters throughout the castle and learning more of the world and it felt like an ongoing mystery.  Here they tried something similar, but I didn’t feel It was well executed.  I felt you didn’t meet characters enough.\n\nThe characters of Alfred, Dominque, Gebel, Zangutsu just all seemed so unknown to me.  I needed a lot more interaction with them.  I also felt the overall story to just be not great…The story seems to be that a group of alchemists created a demon army to attack the world so people would believe in the alchemists more?  When the world then almost ended the alchemists were blamed…because they literally attempted to end the world.  As part of that plan a magical castle from hell was summoned?  This just seems too over the top.  Your character is also supposedly dying of this crystal infusion…but I never really got that feeling during the game.  I needed a lot more dialogue and twists to pull me in.\n\nI’m not sure if I would describe the story as feeling secondary…I would say more like it was the least important thing on the Directors mind.  I put story as the #1 most important thing to me in games and this game just didn’t have it.  Ugh.  So I was mightily disappointed.\n\nI also felt the random drops were way too random and low.  I found it very difficult to level up weapons and abilities because getting the materials needed for this was impossible unless you just wanted to farm forever.  I did not, I still beat the game, I felt I was pretty underleveled and missed the bulk of gear, but I wasn’t not going to spend the hours necessary to level up.  \n\nStill I enjoyed my time exploring the castle and I enjoyed the combat…if the story had been their this would be one of my favorite games.  As it is I would still recommend it, but $40 is just bananas.  I would say #Worth $20.\n",Recommended

"What I have to say is not terribly different from the hordes of people that have most likely said what I'm thinking multiple times over and more likely than not in more articulate manners. Still, it behooves me to leave my impression regardless because that's how much I think of IGA's latest video game and one of the best watermarks he'll leave behind in his legacy.\n\n""Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night"" is a Metroidvania that isn't associated with either Metroid or Castlevania, but it's the exact same type of gameplay that IGA codified with the groundbreaking and cult favorite ""Castlevania: Symphony of the Night"" back in 1997. IGA didn't necessarily invent this type of gameplay (Brain Breaker on the Sharp X1 is an early example, predating SotN by roughly 12 years, among others), but it's understandable why so many people look to him as the genre's gatekeeper and foremost authority on the genre. In Bloodstained, you play Miriam - an orphan girl that is afforded the unfortunate destiny of the infamous 'Shardbinder,' individuals that are afflicted by a terrible curse that eventually turns them crystalline, while at the same time allowing them to harness the powers of demonic entities and use them for their own motivations. Naturally, such peoples are looked upon with disdain and distrust at best and manipulative desires at worst by those around them. Gebel, Miriam's close friend and playable character from the prequel title, ""Bloodstained: Curse of the Moon,"" now presides over a castle that has risen and Miriam is driven to fulfill the promise she made to Gebel: that should either of them become corrupted, and monstrous, the other would pursue a means to stopping them for theirs, and the worlds' sake.\n\n""Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night"" doesn't take place in just the aforementioned castle, however. Before entering properly, Miriam comes upon a village located on the outskirts of said castle that is filled with various villager NPCs that are willing to hand out quests to Miriam in an effort to have their desires appealed to. Such desires include providing food for an elderly lady that has trouble remembering the names of such dishes, a woman that seeks retribution against specific demons, a religious woman that seeks personal effects of the deceased, a farmer that will plant seeds and share with you the harvest, and so on, as well as villagers trapped inside Gebel's nefarious domain that need rescuing. Sating the desires of these villagers will reward you with various items and equipment.\n\nAs RotN is a Metroidvania, first and foremost, it follows a very strict set of guidelines that are almost indicative of IGA himself (which is partly why the marketing for the game calls it ""IGAvania"" instead) - the aforementioned plethora of food, equipment and items along with a massive castle to romp around in, secrets to uncover, new abilities to acquire that ease traversing of the huge domicile, etc. In fact, Ritual of the Night almost feels like a ""Best Of"" of Iga's works. Each and every demon drops a shard that Miriam can acquire which come in the form of attacks, abilities, summons, or familiars (Aria/Dawn of Sorrow), the villagers that hand out side quests (Order of Ecclesia), a variety of whips as well as increasing the rank of abilities (Portrait of Ruin), weapon techniques that can be learned (Symphony of the Night), and being able to craft items, weapons, and equipment (various Castlevanias mentioned). Yes, Ritual of the Night could be in the discussion of Iga's greatest work, if not his most encompassing.\n\nIn addition to these beloved mechanics, at least one new one makes its debut here in the form of the Barber NPC that can be located inside the castle and offers to freely change and customize Miriam's appearance. Some very limited aspect of this was first witnessed in Symphony of the Night, where Alucard could locate different colored capes that had varying stats as well as the almighty, and expensive, Joseph's Cloak which allowed for freely coloring Alucard's cape however you like. But these absolutely pale in comparison to the system seen here as the barber can not only change the color of Miriam's main and sub clothes, but her skin, her eyes, and her hair as well. Not to mention Miriam can locate books that she can return to the barber that will unlock new hairstyles for her to wear. This is the most expansive and most advanced customization seen in an Iga game yet, as far as I can tell.\n\nI mustn't neglect to mention the music is done by none other than Michiru Yamane, who famously composed the soundtrack for Symphony of the Night, as well as several other beloved titles, like Skullgirls. I personally don't think the music heard here is nearly as memorable or diverse as the OST produced for SotN, but I won't complain too much. It's still serviceable, if a bit generic and forgettable.\n\nIf any of what I've told you appeals to you, if you were a Symphony of the Night fan, a Castlevania fan in general, a fan of Metroid, or a fan of Metroidvanias altogether than I deeply implore you to give Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night a try. Not only is the base game absolutely fantastic, but 13 ""free DLCs"" (the backer milestones that were ascertained during the game's development, *ahem*) will be provided in later updates. These updates range from New Game Plus, to multiple playable characters, Co-Op mode, Boss Rush mode, Online play, etc. will be afforded to each and every owner of the game.\n\nI don't know if Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night will up-end Symphony of the Night as Iga's best work, but it comes really damn close if it doesn't. I absolutely recommend this game.",Recommended

"If you are a fan of Castlevania: Symphony of the Night, the big question is, WHY DON'T YOU HAVE THIS GAME YET?\n\nEverybody has been waiting for this game and gladly this game did not end up like how Mighty No. 9 did... and thank god. \n\nI enjoyed every part of the game, especially on the harder difficulties. However there are some unbalanced issues with some of the attacks in this game that I felt need some working on. \n\n1.  Many of the directional shards are overall just better than almost every conjure shard. 90% of my games were just me pressing the button to cast the directional shard.\n\n2. Weapons were next to useless. I never used a weapon... well that is to say I BARELY pressed the attack button unless the enemy I'm fighting just so happens to die in 1 hit (dullahammers for example). Seeing as how in the first example directional shards were overpowered my main method of attack is to just use that.\n\n3. Progression problems. The game has issues trying to tell you where to go next. Near the end of the game, something happens to the shopkeeper, who usually tells you where and what to do next, but before that can happen you must find out where you need to go next that triggers this specific event. Once you do, if you go back to town an npc tells you that you need to go to the place that you were suppose to go that triggered the event... and this part makes ABSOLUTELY NO SENSE because you already found this place, which leads you to think why didn't this npc or anybody else tell you this FIRST before you have to go wandering around everywhere searching for this very specific place that triggers the event? Unless you have a very VERY good memory or attention to detail you would be going CRAZY trying to find this place.\nOh and there's one more. After you get a special ability you must backtrack to places you can go to with this ability to find a very specific item. The problem is how you first approach this area. If you went from one side and explored it normally, it will fill up more than one space, causing you to ""forget"" the fact that this other space in question does not need to be explored when in fact is the MOST IMPORTANT space of all since it contains a very important piece of item for progression purposes. That's what happened to me and I had to look up a walkthrough to see what I was missing.\n\nHonestly, other than these three I felt the game was extremely enjoyable. Great pace of exploration, enemies are perfectly placed. Items as well as the ones hidden in walls were cleverly placed. Many shards have great effects and animations you can enjoy. There weren't many scenes to interrupt gameplay (but unfortunately you can't fully skip them). And there's so much more to the game. We're getting more stuff added on such as new characters, modes, etc. Honestly $40 is a nice price, I would've paid more for such a well made game. Looking forward to a sequel or another series. \n\n10/10 Would buy again... wait that makes no sense. But yea, this game was just too awesome to not want another in the series.",Recommended

"This is a fantastic game.  I hadn't played a Castlevania in maybe ten years, and I very much enjoyed this game.  The core gameplay is fun and solid, the graphics are both very visually appealing and easy to understand in combat, and it is extremely satisfying to feel yourself gain power and progress in the game.  Music is phenomenal.  Story is okay; characters are pretty cool, plot is kind of bad, setting is excellent.\n\nI did not back this game on Kickstarter and did not hear of the kickstarter until after I purchased the game.\n\nI look forward to looking back on this as the founding of a great franchise.  And apparently there's DLC on the way, looking forward to that.\n\nI played 50 hours and got all of the achievements.  Never encountered a bug, though I heard some people have.  Except the treasure bag thing but that's a minor glitch and not a big deal.\n\nThere are one or two places where you may get stuck in progression if you are trying to avoid a guide.\n\nNothing is missable.  There is a solid New Game+ system.  Extremely completionist friendly.",Recommended
"This is the best game I ever forgot I backed.\n\nGraphics: 9/10 - The framerate and fluidity of the gameplay felt very responsive. \n\nStory: 7/10 - It's a side scrolling hack and slash.  A story over 5 is more than I would ask for.  Also, it's Castlevania, we basically already know the story and if we don't we should watch the anime.  *cough*\n\nDifficulty: 6/10 on easy mode because I'm too scared to play hard mode.  I've died.  First boss was hard because I didn't have abilities or equipment.  Otherbosses I just attack 100 times and kill them before I die.  Sometimes I eat food.\n\nCustomization: 6/10 - You can customize, but in the end we're all using the same thing.  Maybe a different hair color or style but that's about it.  It feels like a 10/10 until you realize there's something better or google a cookie cutter setup that makes you invincible.\n\nSecrets/Easter Eggs: 8/10 until one of those secrets is mandatory to progress.  \n\nOverall: 7/10",Recommended

"This is probably the best Metroidvania I've played -- I loved it from beginning to end.  The problem with this genre tends to be wonky controls -- it's a pervasive issue, even going as far back as SOTN, which some would no doubt consider blasphemous Recommended though it may be.\n\nThis game's controls are tighter than a nun's asshole.  The map is huge, the challenge is... just right for those of us who have adulting to do.  The plot was surprisingly coherent, the bosses varied, the special moves interesting.  Zero buyer's remorse, highly recommended.",Recommended
"Symphony of the night 2. I do not know if that is good or bad, probably it is bad. The game works fine if that is the only thing that you were looking for here.",Recommended
If you enjoyed SotN you will enjoy this game. Smooth and very well done. Only real complaint I have is the frequent items being dropped in walls and having to wait for it to auto open to collect (about 30sec). Lot of extra things to do if you're a completionist.,Recommended

It's a great game and I really enjoyed playing it.\nhas a lot of ''end game stuff'' to do.\nDidn't expect to put 40+ hours in a 2D game but here we are.,Recommended
Don't be fooled by the Bloodstained name. This is Castlevania in all its glory. 2nd best Metroidvania style Castlevania and top 5 overall. Every fan of the series should jump at the chance of playing this. Every platform/metroidvania not yet into the series should jump on it too. Masterpiece.,Recommended
"【Recommended】\nThis game is gorgeous and fantastic. The game doesn't force you to do anything,\notherwise, it uses many hidden tips to let you realize that you can do this, achieve this.\nI like the in-game character growth. You can also use a lot of different kinds of weapons.\n\nPros:\n+ So many skills and abilities\n+ Amazing level and enemy design\n+ Beautiful BGM\n+ Reasonable difficulty, nice balance\n+ You can also experience classical style in this game.\n\nCons:\n- Sometimes, because it doesn't have many quest guides,  you may do some useless explorations.\n\n",Recommended
So addicted. Can't stop playing.,Recommended
"For when you want to play a favorite game again for the first time.\n\n...\n\n...\n\n...\n\nThis isn't anything revolutionary, and I personally still don't like the graphics, but if you've ever played and enjoyed a Castlevania, you'll like this.",Recommended
"I'm going to be quoting a line from the Escapist during this review so bare with  me. If you were looking for the next Iga-style castlevania game, look no further than this absolute masterpiece, like Yahtzee Croshaw said in his review (paraphrasing of course) ""It's like if they took all the best parts from previous castlevania games of this style and combined it into a unified package that has it's own sense of style and fun."" It's endlessly fun and a fine example of the metroidvania style of games and a fine example of a Kickstarted Project that actually lives up to all the hype and expectations. Not to mention that it's also looking at 12 DLC releases that are gonna be adding even more content thanks to the kickstarter goals getting smashed back when this was on kickstarter. I fully expect this to go from a masterpiece to an all-time classic of the metroidvania genre when all the DLC finally comes out. 10/10 would highly recommend to anyone who loves metroidvanias and to anyone who loves castlevania. \n\nOnly gripes i really have is that it's a little easy to get lost at some points and i had to go to a walkthrough for help at said points and that the skip cutscene button only skips parts of the cutscene instead of the whole thing. Other than that, it was an awesome experience i intend to replay at some point in the future.",Recommended
"Amazing, truly a great metrovania experience! Igarashi-san has done it! We can tell for sure this is the SotN spiritual successor, very familiar experience and yet fresh at the same time.\n\nMECHANICS:\n\nThe game is very fluid, which surprises me, as in the trailers it didn't seemed so fast paced oriented. But when you start to get the power ups, there is little your character can't do! \n\nYou have [spoiler]double jump, high jump, blink, dodge, slide, super speed (that works like an air dash in the air), a freaking dive kick (lol!), invert mechanics[/spoiler]; 3 buttons to cast magic Y, RB, R all of them with a great variety of skills and possibilities, and more; You have ""fighting game"" commands to use specific weapon skills like ""haduken"", or ""shoryuken"" motions.\n\nThis game has the most completed skill set that I've seen in the history of the metrovania genre. And i'ts freaking godlike!!!\n\nPROS:\n\n- [u]Gameplay[/u]\n\n- [u]Exploration[/u]\n\n- [u]SotN nostalgia[/u]\n\n- [u]Boss Rush/Speed run mode[/u]\n\n- [u]13 FREE DLCs coming [/u](Two additional PLAYABLE characters, Local and online multiplayer, co-op vs. modes, Roguelike mode, Chaos mode, Classic mode, Boss revenge, etc.)\n\nNEUTRAL:\n\n- [u]Soundtrack.[/u] Has some good ones and bad ones.\n\n- [u]Level Design.[/u] Castlevania games were never really focus on challenging level design like more platformer metro oriented games, like Hollow Knight and Ori, but it would've been a great opportunity to try it. = )\n\n- [u]Animation.[/u] Some cutscene animations were a little clunky.\n\nCONS:\n\n- [u]Boss Fights.[/u] To me, this game had only 3 to 4 good boss battles. Most of the bosses where too easy and had a boring design (i'm looking to you glass hand!). So if would say to improve the most important thing, it would be better Boss Design.\n\n- [u]History.[/u] Zzzzzz...not really anything interesting.\n\nVERDICT:\n\nBloodstained is a safe game, not many risks taken. Just a familiar experience from the most popular Castlevania franchise with a flavor of fresh design. Thereafter, this is not bad at all, the game shines at its core, its a great opportunity to new people understand what's is the meaning of ""one of the best metrovania games of all time"" looks like, and a must buy to any metrovania fan.\n\nI rest my case.",Recommended
"Finished playing Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night.  It was a very satisfying experience.  I admit I trivialized the later fights due to my farming and grinding habits (I really wanted to see all the equipment and abilities), but that didn't take away from my enjoyment of the game.  \nMatter of fact, I feel good enough about the game that I want to do a replay on the hardest difficulty, which means no EXP grinding (it wasn't intentional in the first playthrough anyway) and everything just wants to dip their privates into your soup *GLOOP!* as you repeatedly fail.",Recommended
"Despite the few bugs present (getting stuck underwater due to sliding, super loud static after the final boss), this game was incredibly enjoyable. There's a wide variety of combat options that keep the combat fresh, challenging bosses (should you choose not to heal up or use the bunny transformation), and puzzles / out of the box ""routes"" you must go through in order to progress which made the game fun to me. It's rare to see games present the player with a challenging thought puzzle, but also give hints in the story to discover the solution more easily. \n\nIf played on Normal difficulty, there is no real 'grind' needed at any point in the game outside of 100%'ing it, but even then, you are given upgrades to movement and item drops so if you do it correctly it doesn't  take too much time to get the most out of this. Soundtrack and visuals compliment it well.\n\nNot sure if I'd replay it on Hard / Nightmare because most of the fun out of this was discovering it all and playing through it, but that could add more replayability if you're looking for that. Even if you're not a fan of metroidvania's I'd recommend playing this game.",Recommended
O.D. is best character. Nuff said,Recommended
"Its awesome! Complete recommendation from me, game is perfect to play on the couch with a steam link.\nPros:\nGraphics are nice and it runs well\nExploration/progression is open-ended and stays interesting till the end.\nCombat is great.\nGame mechanics are satisfying and not too unforgiving.\nSoundtrack is awesome and fits the atmosphere perfectly.\nCan see myself spending many more hrs trying to 100% the game.\n\nMinor Gripes:\nSound effects. I don't know why but most of the sound effects that you hear from menus and some parts of the game world just sound really rough. This along with some general audio bugs can be distracting since most of the other sound you hear is great.\n\nIts super easy to loose track of what is going on or what you are supposed to be doing. If the story related conversations with the other characters were slightly more frequent or were repeatable then this probably wouldn't be an issue.\n\nDualshock 4 button prompts would be really good too.",Recommended
"What else needs to be said other than this game more than delivers what it promissed?\nwell, I guess I should mention that it also has a bright future ahead of it with plenty of 'free DLC' planned\n\nOnly two negatives I can point to really are the voice acting for some characters could use some work (but all the important characters have good voice acting) and that it made me want more\nMUCH more, because its that damn good.",Recommended

"Spiritual successor' is a term that's used far too often, both restricting how much a game can be considered its own idea, but also rewarding it instant popularity from fans of the source material. Bloodstained can carry the title with pride, taking heavy inspiration from both Symphony of the Night and Order of Ecclesia without copying outright, and blending the best ideas of the Metroidvania genre while separating the chaff.\n\nThe level design is competent, while the visual design is outstanding and even novel at times to make the first playthrough really shine. The boss mechanics are solid enough for replayability and demanding in a fair way. The music is, at times, too afraid to step outside of Symphony's box, but at times can stand on its own as a good score.",Recommended

"I was assured that the reason I thought this game was terrible trash was because I had purchased the horribly flawed Switch version. Despite seeming to be as demanding as a GameBoy game It is apparently too demanding for the smartphone level hardware of the Switch. Based on that deeply misleading advice I gave Bloodstained another shot. I regret that immensely. This is a terrible game. This ""game"" is designed to steal people's money by tricking them through nostalgia for an actual game, that being Symphony of the night. So what about the random hitching and stuttering of this version? The terrible hit detection when you take damage randomly when in the general area of an enemy? Is this the Switch's fault on PC too? No, this game is just garbage, like every other crowd stolen game. I mean crowd funded game. Your life bar disappears with a couple of gentle taps from enemies, save points are clustered together then not seen for seemingly ever, enemies attack you from angles that you can't attack them from, performance issues, delayed movement, floaty, ungainly jumping. This game is junk. Nostalgia is great and all, but that should never cover for a deeply flawed money grab like this. Lazy, uninspired SoTN ripoff.",Not Recommended

"9,5/10\n\nPretty much a masterpiece.\n\nMuch like one would expect from a Koji Igarashi game, Bloodstained is classic metroidvania at its best, starting out very basic and acquiring new gear and upgrades along the way, unlocking new areas of the game that weren't acessible before. The game very clearly takes inspiration from many Castlevania games, but also tries to do something on its own, with a crafting system allowing to create new gear, upgrade shards and create food recipes that provide permanent stat bonuses. And in terms of upgrades, the game also gets pretty creative - you get the basic double jump, but besides that, the game gets pretty creative with the abilities you get to access other areas.\n\nThe game plays and feels great. Controls are responsive, enemy design is interesting, the game looks great and, most of all, the soundtrack is absolutely AMAZING. You get a wide variety of weapons and shards to use, from guns to greatswords and all kinds of powers, allowing for different playstyles to be used, from the standard tackling enemies head-on to attacking from a distance.\n\nThere is also some content to be played after the game is beaten, not just in terms of achievements (which are mostly based on completion) but also in a few optional challenges and secrets to be found. Ultimately, the game can also be replayed in New Game+ mode, with 3 difficulty levels unlocked after the game is beaten, plus a Speedrun mode and a Boss Rush mode.\n\nThe only few issues that keep the game from being a perfect 10/10, aside from a few glitches, are:\n[list][*]Some grinding involved. Fortunately it's optional and you can also use gear with high LCK to improve drop rates so it's not really a major issue, but if you want to get the best weapons and upgrade your shards, then some grinding is going to be involved and depending on which items/shards require grinding, it can be pretty annoying.\n[*]There are a few parts of the game where it's not exactly clear on how to progress, which sometimes require some pretty odd thinking (or checking a walkthrough) to learn on how to progress. As an example, there's one part of the game where you have to go through a part and take damage in order to reach the next area, which is very counter-intuitive.[/list]\n\nOther than these issues, this is an absolutely amazing game, easily worth full price. Plus there's also going to be free DLC in the future as well, so there's going to be reason to keep coming back for more.\n\n200% recommended.",Recommended
"Bloodstained by the creator of symphony of the night is pretty much what you would expect knowing this.  The experience is really reminiscent of that excellent game and deliver in every ways.\n\n-Lots of varied weapons with tons of them feeling very different\n-Lots of useful items to find and collect\n-The caslte is great to explore\n-Most of the shards mechanics are really cool (especially the acceleator + high jump)\n-They integrated a street fighteresque technique system to learn to be even deadlier with each type of weapons.\n-Lots of hidden stuff and mysteries added to secret endings just like SotN\n\nThe game just feel right and is so much fun to play... \n\nAs far as the story goes... well, nobody will win an Oscar for that script but I frankly did not care. It was good enough.. What is cool is they found a way to re-create a Castlevania world which is close enough for everyone liking while staying different enough to avoid being sued ;)\n\nThe only negative comments I would think about is somewhat weird: Seeing the backers faces on the painting all over the castle felt weird to me. It was breaking the immersion somewhat. I wish they had been confined to a specific area instead of everywhere. \n\nIf its the worst I got to say, it says a lot about how cool the game is ;)\n\nIf you are a fan of metroidvania games... just get this one.",Recommended
"After doing a 100% run in this game, in terms of enemy list, quests and map, I can truly say that this is the best metroidvania I've ever played. After having a negative opinion on Hollow Knight, which 95% of people seem to love, I thought new metroidvainias simply wouldn't capture my attention but Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night brought that joy back, unlike Hollow Knight it doesn't reinvent things or force difficulty for the sake of difficulty, like the fact that you need to buy basically your map and different points of interest. Bloodstained offers that but still manages to not over offer, from soundtrack, to bosses, to enemy design to nostalgia, Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night is a masterpiece and deserves to be played by everyone!\nCongratz on the game ArtPlay, just earned a spot on the devs to follow among superstars Larian, CDProjektRED, idSoftware, CAPCOM, FromSoftware and Arkane Studios!",Recommended

The story, the graphics, the game play, the music, everything about this game is amazing. I don't normally freak out over video game soundtracks but it's truly incredible in this game. I literally couldn't stop playing it on my first play through and I couldn't stop looking at it. I even tried to complete as much of the game as I could on my first play through and I never do that.

"What can I say? This game is the long awaited Oasis to someone, who has starved to play a Metroidvania Castlevania for what might have been a decade. And it might actually be one of the best of its genre, if you ask me.\n\nHaving polished the designs the past few years, the game looks really nice. The style of the characters is very memorable as I can actually name everyone of them and even recall their designs. And then also the monster designs, which are just splendid, specifically because of the inspirations they took from the Lesser Key of Solomon for the theme and designs. Plus their animations and sound effects are satisfying, especially of the knights who are making me grin everytime I hear their frustrated death cry.\n\nSound-wise, I just love the voice acting. David Hayter being the highlight, naturally, but Erica Lindbeck shows off her talents that already made me enjoy her as Futaba in P5. Generally, every voice actor is well chosen and delivers their lines with much impact and emotion, including minor npc.\n\nGameplay-wise, Bloodstained RotN is utilizing elements from a few of IGA's past master pieces. And the combination is so well defined, they go well perfectly. The shards are working lovely with ranks and levels making the upgrade of them much more interesting, and the number of actually useful abilities is decent. \nWeapons however are where the game is giving us a lot to look forward to. You got a number of categories: swords, greatswords, katana, spears, daggers, firearms and whips. Or if you feel particularly fashionable, Miriam can try on a few pairs of shoes, which allow her to kick her enemies so hard they explode. And all of these categories have weapons that actually are useful in the end-game. The game further allows for quick changes in your loadout, so you can switch from shooting some demons in the face to skewering with a spear. \nComplimentary to the weapons are techniques, which you learn by using a button combination while having a specific weapon equipped (as in a specific individual weapon, you will learn which ones in-game). And while some are a not quite worth the effort, others can be pretty useful for both combat or just to go really fast.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed the game a lot and I am looking forward to play it again with the upcoming free dlcs, once they come out. It is a Kickstarter Story with a Happy Ending for once.",Recommended
"Nearly perfect follow up to what should have come after the last Metroidvania games after SotN, Iga and co did a great job with all their money from both kicksaterter and some companies to get a nice cohesive game.

"Do you love Metroidvanias? Castlevania games? Haven't played a game of this genre before? If the answer to any of these questions is yes, then you owe it to yourself to play Bloodstained! While Bloodstained does take a lot from Castlevania: Symphony of the Night, it's still very much worth playing on its own. The monster designs and story are really cool, and the gameplay design is nearly flawless, and largely improved over previous games of this style. One major improvement is that you can place markers on the map, for example. There are also highly in depth crafting systems among other systems all designed to make sure you have the fullest experience from the game. While the graphics and soundtrack aren't incredible, you can really feel how much care they put specifically into the gameplay, and it really pays off. I had a blast exploring the castle in Bloodstained! Iga, you've delivered us from the land of developer-focused Kickstarter titles being terrible to middling at best. I can't wait to see what you do next!",Recommended
Perfect Castlevania! This is the game I am waiting for.,Recommended
"This game scratched that SOTN itch I've had for far too long. I'm just glad it wasn't a rash. In any case, I felt like I was sent back 20 years while I played this. I swear, if I had died while playing this game even the most skilled mortician couldn't get the smile off my face. Combat felt great, and the variety of weapons available is outstanding. The leveling never felt grindy, and I actually became OP while grinding for the permanent shard upgrades. The exploration and the options available in this game are simply incredible. Voice acting was on point, which is a bit of a departure from SOTN. There was even a voice I didn't expect to show up from the original game, and I was SOOOOO happy to hear it. The whole scenario involving that character is hilarious. \n\nMy only (minor) nitpicks:\n* The story is utter nonsense\n* I dislike the 3D art style, and was hoping for more 32-bit era pixels\n* Amount of healing items you can carry is severely limited.\n* Cannot see the XP of familiars in the subscreen  \n* The crafting achievement was my last one to complete, and it was a chore. Seriously, have to keep a shopping list of how many enemy drops you need, or you have to farm gold to buy equipment to dismantle...in any case, it is tedious and practically requires a spreadsheet. I think it was the only achievement I didn't have fun completing. At least it was the only task that actually felt grindy.\n\nEven with these issues, I can't recommend this game highly enough. I can't wait to delve back into it when the DLC is released.",Recommended

"Nice game, Although the game has crashed twice for me, When i first got the game i played it for about two days then the first crash happened. And after playing for about three more days the second happened. I guess if you save more often it might not be to much of a problem, But it would get pretty annoying if you progressed allot without saving in a while. But anyway the game is great. I would recommend it. It's pretty fun and the bosses are mostly challenging, By mostly i mean some bosses are easy and other's will give you a beat down if you are not ready.",Recommended

"This is a pretty good game and probably one of IGA's best. Just don't be surprised if it crashes once every few hours and makes you lose your current progress (I spent most of my time on the Switch version which is apparently less stable than the PC version). I recommend saving often just in case.\n\nWith the developers still having a lot of work to do to get all the kickstarter incentives into the game, it'll gain a lot more content and hopefully become a more stable game.",Recommended
"You know a metroidvania is good when you want to play more of it after you put it down. You know a metroidvania is [i]grand[/i] when you encounter the final boss by accident, immediately hit quit, and re-load so you can finish off every last bit of questing and exploration from the map first. (Even if the quest is farming dragons to make a Souffle for an insatiable old lady...)\n\nBloodstained encompasses everything people have come to love from the combat metroidvania genre: Satisfying movement, excellent music, rewarding exploration, a plethora of character build options, and a veritable army of interesting enemy designs to use it on. To mix things up, it also throws in some more novel additions such as crafting and an upgrade system for your spells. The 3D aesthetic may not be to everyone's liking, but I will say that it enables some things in terms of movement and encounter design that make up for it not being traditional spritework.\n\nThe only nitpick I can think of is it seems too easy to outlevel certain bossfights by so much, you beat them without seeing their moveset.

"Pretty much the best aspects of every Igavania game prior rolled up into one.  I'm not fond of the crafting and the graphics are a bit off occasionally, but if you like Symphony of the Night, Aria of Sorrow, or pretty much any other metroidvania, you'll love this game too.",Recommended

"It's everything you could've expected from Igarashi. Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night has a nice, solid detail that branches from the atmosphere, to the controls, the detail and also the sound. The background and story of the entire game carries a dark, gritty feel that is Recommended to home what you'd expect from the individual responsible for Castlevania's beginnings.\n\nThe shard system is akin to Aria of Sorrow, where you obtain skills and abilities from slaying monsters, but with it is a two-tiered system where obtaining multiples of the same shard increases its effects, and enhancing them via the Alchemy system improves what the shard is capable of.\n\nThe same system also allows for creating equipment and making food, which not only gives you health and magic replenishment, but grants you a permanent passive boost for the first instance of each food consumed. That alone has you striving to find each and every single ingredient to make all the food.\n\nThe entire game as a whole feels so unique, but the gameplay, especially if you're an avid Castlevania fan, makes you feel right at home. Getting used to the mechanics may be a bit off at first, but the first stage is practically your tutorial.\n\nOverall, this is worth your time and money.",Recommended
"It's not often that a game achieves perfectly and exactly what it has been set to do. Bloodstained achieves this.\n\nA spiritual sucessor to Castlevania: Symphony of the Night and the Nintendo DS Castlevania games, Bloodstained does everything an Igavania fan would want. Here's the giant castle, the gothic atmosphere, the dozens of weapons and accessories, the powers collected from defeated enemies, and so on.\n\nWhat the game lacks in innovation - there's very little here we haven't seen before - it more than makes up in polish and quantity. The map is immense, there are hundreds of craftable items, dozens of powers to be acquired; the map looks beautiful, gameplay is very smooth, the difficulty is fair, and unlocking everything is perfectly doable.\n\nAnd, what is always a plus, there's no nefarious money-making scheme here. No microtransaction, no extorsive DLC, no pay wall.\n\nIf you're a fan of the original Metroidvania games, get this. It has been made for you.",Recommended

"This game is everything you want out of a spiritual successor to Symphony of the Night.  Even borrowing elements from Aria of Sorrow, the ability to gain powers from slain enemies.  There are some bugs in the game still, but they seem to be few and far between, or minor annoyances at best.  The controls feel really good on the PC version, and the boss fights are very well designed with telegraphed attacks and good attack patterns.  There's also the potential to become just ludicrously powerful, and plow through bosses without mercy.  A ton of secrets, a lot of things to collect.  The story is entertaining, and in SOTN fashion has multiple endings.  And this is without the game really reaching it's completion, as there are still upcoming additions to be included.  This game is an absolute masterpiece, with raw skill and talent on display.  I cannot recommend this game enough.",Recommended
"Listen up my dogs, \n\nThis game is the tits.

Get this game if you have not already, it is well worth it.

While it's a little rough around the edges (graphically and mechanically), I think as a first real game in the franchise, it's a great start.\n\nCurse of the Moon is obviously the more polished and complete package but Ritual of the Night is a brand new IP and it's obvious there are more ideas that the creators wanted to implement but meeting a release date came first. The adoption of the Unreal Engine opens up more possibilities for the franchise. Imagine if there was a collaboration with the likes of, say, Arc System Works? \n\nI recommend this game to anyone that misses that Symphony of the Night feel. For the people that stay along for the ride, the future of Bloodstained looks promising.",Recommended

"[url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/24097642/]Steady Giveaways Curator[/url]\n\n[h1]The Vania Title We All Wanted[/h1]\nI honestly never played much castlevania when I was growing up except for that faithful time I finally ran into Symphony Of The Night. Running around and exploring the castle with some really cool themes, characters, and abilities was amazing.This game is pretty much the closest thing SOTN fans have to that but on modern platforms. Running around with full 3D models in the beautifully designed castle will certainly scratch that nostalgia itch. Everything you remember about that particular era of castlevania games is here. A sprawling castle, interesting abilities, intriguing characters, fun bosses, secrets a many, and a hauntingly beautiful soundtrack. The voice acting is pretty great as well.There is future dlc planned some of which is free so that is also super exciting stuff to make you come back and visit this game again. \n\n[h1]The Minor Gripes[/h1]\nI don't really have anything bad to say on this one. It was exactly what I was hoping it was. I got plenty of amazing content and it appealed to the enjoyment of one of my favorite games. If you are some how unfamiliar with the genre it could be a bit difficult to get fully immersed in and enjoy with all the backtracking and exploration that will be necessary. I was hoping for a bit more with pure 100% completion (perhaps a costume unlock or something) but getting there is still just as satisfying as it was in the older vania games. There is character customization; but it felt a bit lacking.These are all really small nitpicking issues though.\n\n[code][h1](っ◔◡◔)っ ♥ pros ♥[/h1]\n+Pretty much the same reasons Castlevania Symphony Of The Night was amazing.....\n+(Fun battle and bosses, loads to unlock and explore, interesting story, secrets, beautiful soundtrack, etc)\n\n[h1](っ>▬<)っ x cons x[/h1]\n-Newcomers to the genre may have difficulties adjusting to the high exploration and backtracking required \n-I wish character customization was a bit more flushed out\n[/code]\n\nForty dollars may seem high for the content but it is honestly worth it. Pure 100% completion will probably take you around 30 hours and there is still higher difficulties to play along with more future content. Some of which is free and some of which has already come out such as boss rush and speed run mode. If you are a fan of Castlevania Symphony Of The Night; you know exactly what you are getting into here and you know why it would be worth the asking price.

A lot backtracking that is more interesting and enjoyable than annoying. Good fighting gameplay, so you dont get annoyed while traveling the same areas over and over.\nYou have nice progress by new abilities, levellups, weapons etc.\n\nThis game is already a masterpiece and there is a bunch (13) of free DLC like new characters, new modes (coop, pvp multiplayer) on the way to make this game even better.\n\n\nThe only things i could mention negativly are a so far low quality story and the game beeing too easy in normal mode.\nGames like this are allowed to kick me in the face right ahead.

If you liked SotN you will like this game at least as much — it's fantastic. I even had the same experience I had in SotN of ""accidentally"" beating the game early and getting the ""bad"" ending, then discovering I wasn't even halfway through the game yet.\n\nLike in SotN, if you take the time to farm enemies you might find rare weapons or other equipment. I happen to find farming enemies to be relaxing and a bit addicting; it's like gambling, rolling the dice on each kill and hoping for that rare drop. This game is wonderful for completionists because it has several categories with completion stats visible in the menus (e.g. map clear %, weapons %, shard %).",Recommended

"I remember watching and playing SotN on a friends playstation in the early 2000's. Bit late to the party but still! It felt like a never ending game and so often did one have to retreat with the tail tucked between the legs.\n\nPush forward to 2019 and I have now finished Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night. Is it the most beautiful game? Nope, Is it extremely cheesy? Yes. But it feels like this is part of the whole concept to the game and hearing David Hayter as the demon hunter in this game is really weird and it makes me think of old days Metal Gear Solid...which is good. \n\nEither way. What Iga did here was not repeat Mighty Nr 9 which is extremely good.  Cause this game did not look good for a while. I was not even going to touch it. Hollow Knight was looking beautiful but to me, the game was depressive and boring. I did not like it. But Bloodstained got me stuck. I think it overstayed its welcome and has a few annoying bugs, the game kept freezing on me but stopped when I swapped around save slots for some reason. But as you can hear, I am not a big fan of Igavanias but I still came back to Bloodstained, kept on playing and manage to beat it in the end. Mostly probably cause it reminded so much of SotN, A spiritual successor with new mechanics that adds more to it. The game is equally cryptic, cheesy and charming, with 4 playable characters! (2 is yet to come) \n\nNot the hardest game out there but it was a fun ride while it lasted and there is more content coming, there is more game modes in the game and that adds more to it to people who love to do boss or timed rushes  and NG+. For any fan of Castlevania, Metroid/Igavanias and platforming action  RPGs which I presume this could be vaguely proclaimed as, this is a surefire buy.",Recommended

"As a huge Castlevania fan, I can confidently say that this is the Recommended successor to Castlevania.",Recommended
"Highly recommended (8.7/10)\n\nAn unquestionable success among the numerous Kickstarter projects. For the fans of Castlevania it worth the years of waiting since 2015. It recalls all the feelings of the old days when playing Castlevania on NES, Sega Genesis, PlayStation, Gameboy Advance, and Nintendo DS. It collects all the successful elements from previous games and put all of them into this one game. Everyone can find their favorite part in Bloodstained, no matter which Castlevania they have played before. However, this ""Take-all-in-one"" strategy satisfies the fans but limits the novelty of the game. Compared to other ""remake"" games like RE2, it looks less modern and less attractive enthusiastic to new gamers.  \n\nGraphics (8/10):\n* Graphics is revolutionary compared to the ones twenty years ago, but not that good in 201X. Critically speaking, there are obvious technical flaws in the 3D characters and background and the 3D Animations are not fluent enough. The current staff is not as strong as that in Konami.\n\nGameplay (9/10):\n* The gameplay framework is an ensemble of the ARPG Castlevania games that appear on PlayStation, Gameboy Advance, and Nintendo DS. Various weapons, souls, and items to be collected and upgrades, while collecting materials is too repetitive even compared to the ARPG pre-sequels.\n\nMusic (9.5/10):\n* The music is perfect and made based on themes from many famous Castlevania soundtracks.  It is one of the most distinguishable elements of Castlevania series.\n\nDifficulty (4/10):\n* The game is easy thanks to the ARPG oriented design. It can be challenging in a speedrun or other self-made playstyle. Everyone can enjoy it in their own way. \n\nControl (8/10):\n* There is no delay from controllers and everything happens instantly and smoothly. But there are some bugs that the inputs can not be recognized sometimes, which never happens in the old Castlevania games.\n\nOverall, it is a complete ""remake"" of ARPG Castlevania without any innovations. It is recommended to all the fans who are really into the traditional 2D ARPG games.",Recommended
"A very solid metroidvania, albeit with some faults. The rng in this game for some early game items is rather severe, although there are some solid systems in place, i.e. you are almost guaranteed at least one ""OP"" weapon/spell that will carry you. Furthermore there is actually little item variety at end game, which is kind of a shame. \n\nThe boss encounters are alright, the controls, with a mouse and keyboard, are very responsive. Unfortunately, although you do get some cool movement abilities, the moveset feels somewhat lacking, only being restricted to a few special abilities with your weapon along with your spell shards that are also limited without using shortcuts. \n\nThe game doesn't take itself very seriously and is very kid-friendly in the vein of the classic castlevania games. \n\nThe crafting is somewhat grindy and prohibitive, because there are quite a few weapons that I didn't get to try even after nearly 25 hours of play, due to the extreme grinding/luck requirements. \n\nDifficulty is as you would expect for a classic SNES game, but definitely not on par with the NES castlevania era. Since I am not good at games, this was a positive for me, but for people seeking extreme levels of challenge, I recommend starting on hard and not using any healing items until you reach a save point. \n\nOverall a solid game, but if you're expecting for it to surpass the classics, well.. don't, those times are gone it seems.",Recommended

"[h1]A Traditional Metroidvania That Whips ALL The Right Notes[/h1]\n\nWhile there have been plenty of Metroidvanias released between now and the last IGAvania that was ever released (Order of Eccesia), none have really been able to capture the essence of what truly makes an IGAvania special... until Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night that is.\n\nA game successfully kickstarted and worked on by none other than Koji Igarashi himself and his team over at Art Play, Bloodstained: RotN has been an incredible ride and a delightful treat all the way to the Recommended ending fight of the game... \n\nHeavily inspired by many of IGAs past works, even referencing them on many points outright, any fan of Traditional Castlevania and even the SotN created Metroidvania genre is going to feel right at home in the biggest Castle that IGA has made yet!\n\n[h1]Pros:[/h1]\n\n+Amazing Soundtrack that captures the Castlevania feel perfectly\n\n+Gorgeous 3D graphics and well done 2.5D sections that will really turn your head\n\n+Traditional Metroidvania Map Exploration/Progression\n\n+Symphony of the Night inspired Combat and hidden techniques\n\n+Aria/Dawn of Sorrow Style Soul/ability collecting and leveling well as Crafting system\n\n+Large Variety of Enemies, Bosses and Weapons to use\n\n+Order of Ecclesia inspired No Damage Boss Medals\n\n+Portrait of Ruin Style Mastery System for leveling Abilities\n\n+Many Additional Modes, Unlockables, Cheat Codes with Tons more Free DLC on the way\n\n[h1]Cons[/h1]\n\n-Game may feel a tad cryptic to progress in certain instances of your first playthrough without a guide\n\n-No Autosave, which means if your game crashes you will lose progress up until the last Save you did, which unfortunately does happen from time to time...\n\n-Game is 50 Dollars with the Sword Whip and IGA boss Fight DLC which may feel a bit expensive for a game which most people will finish in under 12 Hours.

"First Impressions: \nThis game is good. Not perfect and there are a few minor glitches right off the bad, but it's good. It's also difficult. Not necessarily Dark Souls levels of hard, but definitely more than a walk through the mushroom kingdom.  Animations are smooth, controls feel fluent too. I think my only complaint is the English translation and voice acting. It isn't the worst I've seen, but it also isn't great. Switch to Japanese for best effect. \n\n7/10: Super Castlevania 9: Symphony of the Night.",Recommended
"A solid Castlevania game with great performance, excellent gameplay and tight controls. NG+ for multiple playthroughs and several modes to choose from.\n \nNo ultra-wide support and a controller is highly recommended",Recommended
Best Metrovania game I've played since literally SOTN. Definitely worth the wait!,Recommended
"I backed this on Kickstarter because I love Castlevania, and I wanted to see if Iga would be able to knock it out of the park again.\n\nThis game is amazing. If you like Castlevania, you absolutely need to pick up this masterpiece!",Recommended
"Bloodstained is one IGA-ass Castlevania. It's something of a giant combination of the various Castlevania games IGA worked on. It is obviously extremely reverential to Symphony of the Night, given that was the breakout ""Metroidvania"" Castlevania, but the weapon combat is much more in-line with Portrait of Ruins, while the shards are obviously very derivative of the Soul system from Aria/Dawn of Sorrow. The overall plot integration and quality-of-life aspects, including side quests, feel very in-line with Order of Ecclesia. \n\nAs a huge fan of all of those games, I'd say Bloodstained holds its own, with its most distinguishing trait being the extremely well-thought out alchemy system, the changes to changes to the ability slots from Souls/Ecclesia, and the diversification of play styles compared to past games enabled by supporting more self-directed specialization. I ended up spending most of the game using maces, backed by the fairy companion dispersing healing. My friend went all-gun, with the sword familiar. \n\nIn terms of minor quibbles:\n\n1. Enemy diversity is fairly low by comparison to the Castlevanias. This can probably be chalked up to the fact that they could leverage sprites from previous games, whereas here, with this *huge* castle, that's not an option. \n\n2. Core plot was lacking by comparison to the emotional weight of, say, Order of Ecclesia. Miriam is a bit bland compared to Shanoa (which is rather funny given Shanoa spends a bunch of that game as an amnesiac). Gremory does good work as a Death stand-in, but there's no one really playing that ""oh lawd it's the Big Bad Dude"" role for most of the game.\n\n3. ""Biggest IGA Castle ever!"" ... maybe it shouldn't have? It's very big, yeah, but I do wonder if less would have in-fact been more here. \n\nBut those are, again, very minor. Overall, as a Kickstarter backer I'm quite happy with this. Looking forward to seeing both the post-release support, as well as where any future sequels may go.",Recommended
"A great game overall and tons of stuff to keep you going.  I wasn't really expecting to like it so much but I read a few people said it was a lot like Order of Ecclesia and thought I would give it a try.  I started playing and soon realized I was hours into the game, had fought 4 bosses, (only about 20% of map done) and changed my hair style twice.....worth the price I think.",Recommended
The voice acting can be a bit cheesy (the English at least). Other than that very good game overall.,Recommended

"This is an amazing game. Full stop. It is far and away my favorite of 2019.\n\nI want you to think about the gravity of that sentence for a minute: Slay the Spire went 1.0 this year and it still takes second. \n\nIt is not a ""retro game with updated mechanics,"" as many reviews will tell you in so many words. It is an excellent, one-every-five-years-if-you're-lucky game built atop excellent mechanics and a team that has to be the best in the word at creating the things they create. This is not the kind of masterpiece that happens by accident. \n\nIn fact, you'll probably be better off to ignore the word ""retro"" altogether. I can't  stand the noveau retro-design phase... hate it so much I could only play The Messenger for a couple of hours before I burned out. This, on the other hand, is straight stealing time from me with its depth, fun gameplay, massive enemy roster... the list goes on forever. \n\nAnyway - if you are on the fence, waiting on a bigger sale, etc., knock it off and acquire the game immediately. For all you know the world is going to end tomorrow, and trust me--you will be looking down at the mortal realm with scorn and disgust, missing an opportunity like this.",Recommended
Well worth the wait with even more content to come.,Recommended
Good,Recommended
"Bloodstained is a successor to the Castlevania franchise, for better or for worse. While this game has done a ton of good and really improved on a lot of mechanics, it's still deeply rooted in the ancient practices of the original Igavanias. I should say I've played most of the Castlevania series, enjoyed roughly half of it, and have a lot of the same complaints across all games, including this one. That said, this is far detached in quality from the rest of the Castlevania series; this is a far better game than any other Igavania I've ever played. \n\nIt creates a sense of creating your own adventure, where older players might rush through the game and enjoy the difficulty of fighting the boss with weak stats, whereas newer players or worse players like me enjoys grinding, customization, and ultimately breaking the game. One of the major hallmarks of a good game is if it can create the feeling of a lot of content without making any part of it feel like it's dragging on, and Bloodstained achieves this. Grinding feels fun and feels productive with exceptionally cool and powerful spells at your command along with fantastic customization. I'd definitely suggest playing this game on your own terms, and ignoring whatever anyone that tells you how to play the game. There's a lot of playstyles and effective strategies and none of them require you to grind or to be skilled. \n\nI mentioned before the complaints I have stretch across all Castlevania games, and this being the successor to the franchise, shares those complaints. The trap level is unfun, medusa heads are as annoying as ever, enemies are repeated from other games and recolored in the same game, the hit stun is heavily disruptive to the combat flow, and some enemies require you to either cheese them or be heavily overleveled. The latter isn't extremely common, in fact only three come to mind, but that's nonetheless a frustration I would've preferred to go without. Games are supposed to be fun, and while they absolutely introduced a lot of anti-frustration, I'm still left hoping for more in the next entry. \n\nIn summary, the complaints are minor and the positives are exceptional. Truly a lot of thought, passion, creativity, and above all else, skill went into this game. Truly, this is one of my favorite games ever and I regret not having backed it. I'll be sure to back the next one Iga, thank you very much for this shining example of how igavanias can improve and should improve.\n\n9/10, Bloodstained is nearly perfect",Recommended
"The best game of its type since Symphony of the Night. There are some crusty visuals here and there, but they really did a great job overhauling the graphics since the demo was released. The backgrounds look really great in a lot of the areas. There is a shit ton of stuff to do and unlock, so I can't wait to see if they end up releasing expansions or even a full fledged sequel. Keep it up Iga.",Recommended
very cool game,Recommended
"If you liked SOTN, you should like this one as well. It's overall well done; Didn't crashed for me, and didn't wasted my time with a story.\nI can't see anything major ""bad"", game is fluid, QOL thing like shortcut avoid going trough your inventory during a fight, and you drop/find lot of shard (and weapons with sometime special move) that make the fight varied during the game. It's a bit sad that a good half of them are near useless compared to each other, but hey, it help feeling good when you find something better than the crap you just dropped.\n\nDifficulty can be low, if you find some ""op"" shard (spell) or weapons (one especially in my mind) it can be a cakewall in basic difficulty. Playing in the second difficulty can help, but won't cut it as long as you grind the right shard/weapon. Don't pick this game to get a chalenge.\n\nGrinding is part of the game; it's not required to grind everything of course, but you can always gear up if it become too hard for you (and get extra stats by farming food stuff). Playing in normal and being decent/good at this kind of game will allow you to skip almost any grinding if you wish so. The more you complete the game the faster it is to get item, money, shard; you can always come back later to max out a shard if needed.",Recommended
"tl;dr: The game is a love letter to Castlevania fans. Buy it!\n\nThis is the game I've been waiting for over the past 10 years, and it was definitely worth it.\n\nThe difficulty is nice and gets very challenging (but not impossible) towards the end, which I appreciate a lot since most IGAvanias get very easy as you progress because of the increasingly powerful equipment and enemies that don't scale to compensate for that. This issue is non-existent in Bloodstained unless you go out of your way to over level and upgrade every Shard to rank and level 9 (which is a very grindy process). I haven't played Hard Mode yet, but I'm sure I'll have a lot of fun as well, so I'm looking forward to it a lot.\n\nThe music is excellent as well. Miss Yamane definitely hasn't lost her charm. Most themes sound fresh and new, yet nostalgic at the same time, and I love that. The tracks made by the other composers are absolutely breathtaking too. I believe this is the game's strongest aspect.\n\nAlso, if you're scared about the million problems reported for the console versions, don't be; the PC version doesn't have any of those. In fact, the only bug I found was the item bag getting stuck on a wall (you still get the item though), but that's gonna be fixed in the next update of the game. The optimization is really well done too; the game runs at a consistent, buttery-smooth framerate, and only drops slightly (around 5-8FPS) during a late-game boss fight, but only because you're fighting a giant enemy which stacks a bunch of objects in a big chunk of the screen.\n\nIn general, Bloodstained is more of a Castlevania game than the disgrace called Lords of Shadows, or anything that came out after Order of Ecclesia, really. I'm excited to see what the future holds for Bloodstained, since I recall IGA saying he wanted to make a series out of it.",Recommended
It's really good. You should  get it :D,Recommended
One of the very few kick started games to IMHO live up to the hype. Awesome tribute to Symphony of the Night and even surpasses it in some ways. I will also add that on the PC it run rock solid at 1080p with a pretty modest gaming rig (GTX 970 with a Haswell i7 and 16 GB RAM). Very pleased that I decided to purchase this on Steam.

This game is fantastic, it's been a while since a single player game made an impression on me as this one.\n\nI did not experience any bugs playing this game A+ on that!\n\nThis game left me wanting more and not in a bad way, by all means this game in it's genre has a large map, about 21 bosses and so many secrets and Easter eggs but it was such a great experience it left me wanting more of this game!\n\nI actually ended up doing 100% everything in it and even maxed out all the shards etc that's how addicted I am.\n\nMy only two constructive  criticisms would be:\n1) I wish each individual armor would change Miriam's appearance and that there was a separate skinning aesthetic window to drop items you want to apply the look of for a truly custom character appearance that does not affect your choice of gear due to stats.\n2) Would be nice if there was some sort of arena mode or area that gets cumulatively more difficult multiplying monster stats and pulling monsters at random from the games library of demons. Like a ranked survival mode for some neat end game fun once your character becomes too strong.\n\nIn conclusion, this is now my favorite ""Metroidvania"" game, Miriam is an awesome character and would love to see more of this in the future!",Recommended

"Very reminiscent of SoTN in the best possible ways. I enjoyed the crafting and cooking, hunting down recipes, and the dialogue easter-eggs. Works fine with an XBOX 360 gamepad but I had to do some tweaking to reduce the input latency (there is an option for it in-game but it still had too much for me to enjoy). The latency was an easy-fix, just required turning off v-sync and then going into Radeon Settings and forcing enhanced-sync. I think the game is beautiful in motion and just the right length for a metroidvania. I finished my playthrough at about 16 hours and now I'm just poking around, looking for anything I may have missed. It is a very worthy buy if you're into the genre!",Recommended
"This is how to make a Kickstarter right.\nIf you enjoyed Symphony of the night and the other Castlevania games released after (not the 3D ones), you'll have a blast with this game.\nAlso, David Hayter.",Recommended
"This game is a console port. Bear that in mind; there are some, relatively few but some, places where the adaptation to keyboard and mouse were rather less than perfect; such as the relatively clunky way that aimed shards (spells) are handled, requiring an entirely separate button when the left-mouse would have done just fine, and the [b]absolute lack[/b] of a mouse cursor in menus, which is frankly unforgivable in any game sold for PC.\n\nUnforgivable... But not the end of the world. A black mark against Bloodstained, and not its only one.\n\nThe other black mark against Bloodstained, in general but particularly for keyboard use, is the inclusion of Fighting-Game style input commands. These are wholly unnecessary in any game which is not of that genre; [i]especially[/i] in that these commands act entirely as if they were spells, consuming mana which can be used for a (typically vastly-more-powerful) spell, whether or not the input command is efficacious. An execution barrier on top of subpar performance and mana use just makes these woefully unattractive, which is a shame because they are [i]very, very cool![/i]\n\nSome of these commands have inputs which are perfectly fine, such as forward-forward attack, or down-down attack, but some of them are unnecessarily difficult such as a quarter-roll-of-the-D-Pad [i](what[/i] D-Pad?!) or analog stick and attack, and some of them are simply obnoxious, such as quarter-roll-backwards-forwards-attack, or full-revolution-hold-attack.\n\nThis drove me sufficiently nuts, especially my frustrations when attempting to use my Redragon gaming mouse's hotkeys to overcome this problem, that I rather lost my head, and a key off my keyboard, and enraged me to the point of writing a negative review firstly.\n\n[i]Thankfully[/i], an absolute [i]hero[/i] on the discussion forums went and made an [url=https://steamcommunity.com/app/692850/discussions/0/1642041886381441374/?ctp=3#c1642041886383210583]Auto Hot Key script[/url] that very fantastically democratizes most of these these otherwise obnoxious inputs to a simple use of the shift key and directional inputs. [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/WeaponMaster46]Weapon Master[/url] deserves much praise, for doing something that Iga himself should have done.\n\nThose are the major flaws of Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night; the Keyboard-and-mouse integration needs work, most notably on the menu screens, and an obnoxious input barrier for subpar, weapon-dependent ""spells"" that are just too damn cool not to use.\n\nWhat's the good?\n\nLike, flippin' everything else!\n\nI reckon I first played Castlevania: Symphony of the Night in like, 1998 or 1999, and until now, nothing has [i]really[/i] come close to matching it, at least in terms of a fantasy-genre game. (Metroid sidescrollers always delivered, of course.) This is a proper, side-scrolling action-RPG; with sidescrolling action first, but the RPG elements are not slouching. They could be more prominent if the emphasis was shifted from the Action to RPG, but it's a good balance nonetheless. Essentially, it's an update of [i]Castlevania: Symphony of the Night's[/i] gameplay, admittedly not [i]too[/i] much updated which is fine if you're got a massive nostalgia itch that's gone unscratched for two decades.\n\nAnother major pro is, in my mind, a female protagonist. There's also a lot of hat action going on, though I am somewhat disappointed that Miriam's [i]outfits[/i] don't change, only her hat, and some accessories display on her face. And her boots, if you have a shoe-type weapon equipped. Still, once you find Todd, you can customized her coloration quite a lot, give her new hairstyles, etc.",Recommended

"A modern update to Castlevania.\n\nI've been searching for a 2D Castlevania clone, but they generally tend to fall short - not retaining the magic or having the gameplay set off in a new direction.\n\nHowever, Bloodstained really nail it; the master needed to be the one to update the series.  Great graphics, combat, speed, and crafting/leveling systems.  The story is nothing and the cinematic models are slightly rough, but the overall levels, gameplay, and customization are fantastic.\n\nIt does start slightly hard and slow, but give it 1-2 hours and then you should be deep into the game, especially if you ever liked a Castlevania game.  There is just something about the feel of this game - I find myself happily coming back just to grind some materials for crafting, to work on an achievement, etc.  For the price, I can't believe that I will have ended up with 25+ hours of fun gaming and this is going to be in my top 10, if not top 5, for 2019.",Recommended

"I want to preface this by saying that I'm not generally a fan of metroidvanias. I didn't finish Samus Returns on 3DS or any other Castlevanias on GBA.\n\nThis game however has been great fun. At the start it did feel old and archaic in its mechanics (""I can only backstep? The backstep barely avoids anything! Oh why can't I roll/parry?"") but as you go on you unlock abilities and weapons that squash that feeling completely. This game turns out to be quite a bit of fun and the best part is is that it has enjoyable farming. If you upgrade a passive shard to rank 9 it becomes automatically added to your passive bonuses even if you unequip it, so there's great incentive to farm shards, materials to upgrade them. Food gives you permanent stat boosts if eaten for the first time so it's fun trying to find ingredients for meals, there are shards and items that give you bonuses based on your current gold, or the amount of monsters you've killed, or the amount of the map you've explored so it's always fun to do pretty much anything in this game.",Recommended

Every skill you use must be farmed to grade 9, which is about 1 hour of killing the same enemy in repetition.

"[h1]Introduction[/h1]\nMy first Castlevania experience was with [b]Castlevania II: Belmont's Revenge[/b] for the Game Boy. At the time, as a young child, I did not appreciate it for what it was. It wasn't until around 2005 or 2006 when I picked up [b]Circle of the Moon[/b] for the GBA that I really enjoyed Castlevania, albeit in its Metroidvania form. A few years later, in 2008, some friends recommended [b]Symphony of the Night[/b] to me, and I was immediately smitten by it. Sure, Circle of the Moon is great, but it doesn't quite match with the immensely well-deserved reputation of SotN.\n\nWhen I first learned about [b]Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night[/b], my expectations were tempered, purely because it was a Kickstarter project, which doesn't inspire the greatest of trust. However, and to my great relief, all fears were unfounded within the first few seconds of gameplay.\n\n[h1]Commendations[/h1]\n[list]\n    [*]I chose to play the game with a wired Xbox 360 controller, as I assumed that it would have been designed from the ground as the ideal method, rather than mouse and keyboard. This decision seemed to be the correct one, as the game handles almost flawlessly. The one thing which I felt was slightly awkward to begin with was aiming magic with the right stick then firing with the right trigger, but this became more comfortable over time.\n\n    [*]The shard system is the game's way of gradually feeding you new abilities. The vast majority of enemies (known as demons) you defeat are capable of dropping a shard, which add to your arsenal of powers. These range from simple projectile magics and passive stat boosts to the ability to summon a chair at any time. While the game already has a well-established meta for shards to use, there really is no ""wrong"" way to approach the game. I will admit to finding a few and sticking to those for the majority of the game\n\n    [*]Like the shards, there are a huge number of weapons you can choose from for your demon-slaying escapades. Also similarly, there is no ""bad"" type of weapon; it all comes down to your preferences. For the first 30% of the game, I used boots and rapiers in equal parts. After that, I traded those in for a katana. By the time I finished my first playthrough, I had ultimately settled on using a spear, which took me all the way through Hard and Nightmare modes.\n\n    [*]The game has decent replayability with its three difficulty modes. The game starts on Normal mode, which would be familiar to players from Symphony of the Night. After finishing that, Hard mode is unlocked, followed by Nightmare mode. At the end of each playthrough, you have the choice of restarting on another difficulty with your items and levels, or you can start fresh. Additionally, the Boss Rush and Speedrun modes are also unlocked after one playthrough.\n\n    [*]I streamed this game for a friend briefly, and she commented on the variety of enemies that exist within it. The game does use the occasional palette swap, but, for the most part, you will be finding unique demons along every step of your journey.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Condemnations[/h1]\n[list]\n    [*]The biggest criticism I can put forward is the fact that progression is, at times, easy to lose sight of. To clarify, the game begins in a linear fashion, becoming increasingly open as you unlock movement techniques. After awhile, many parts of the map become available to explore, making it hard to tell where you need to go. At one point, you have to unlock the ability to swim, and there are virtually no clues as to how you accomplish this. There are two other infamous moments, which are spoken about at length in various discussions about this game.\n\n    [*]Speaking of swimming, there is one mandatory swimming section. I don't know if it's just me, but the 5 minutes spent in that part were excruciating. What is it with games and bad water levels? Fortunately, it really is a short segment, give or take a few moments depending on how good/careful you are.\n\n    [*]The quest design is, to put it lightly, dull. There are three NPCs from whom you get optional quests from, and they all fall under two categories. Fetch an item or kill [i]x[/i] number of demons. They are worth doing for the rewards, but they are just as uninspired as Skyrim's radiant quests.\n\n    [*]If you have any desire to farm every weapon, armour and shard in the game, then you are in for the long haul. All demons have a chance to drop their loot, and many of the most valuable items have drop chances of less than 5%. Considering that you will end up needing several copies of each, both for crafting and upgrading, it really does end up taking a long time. Fortunately, drop chances can be inflated by increasing your luck stat.\n\n    [*]Cosmetic items have stats associated with them. Therefore, if you want to min-max, cat and bunny ears are out of the question.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nThis title is truly the spiritual successor to Symphony of the Night. Ritual of the Night iterates upon what made the genre great while being its own unique entity. Some may call it a shameless clone that exploits nostalgia. Some may call it lazy. I, on the other hand, call it a glorious revisiting of an era of gaming that most fail to do. It knows what it wants to be, and it succeeds on almost every count.\n\nIf you have even the slightest inkling that you would enjoy this game, whether it be based on nostalgia or on what you have read or seen, then just buy it. The few shortcomings it does have are extremely easy to overlook.\n\nWell done, [i]Koji Igarashi[/i]. Mankind indeed needs a saviour such as you!",Recommended

"Castlevania: Symphony of the Night is my favorite game of all time. When i first got my hands on it as a kid, it changed my view of what a game could be, what it could offer and what should be expected from everything in it's genre, a genre it changed and evolved and broke out of, creating the all too famous Metroidvania genre of games. The gameplay, music, environments, spells, weapons, items, enemies, boss battles, secrets. Everything about this game spoke to me, it was so good that I began judging every game after it against it. This game set the bar so high, nothing has even come close.\n\nThen Bloodstained released. \n\nI love this game. I've logged over 40 hours into it already and I'm still not even close to done with it yet. As far as the core game goes, yes, I've beaten it several times, but being the die hard completionist I am with Castlevania games, it felt only natural to continue that trend with Bloodstained. I've been systematically crossing off achievements, insisting on finding every single secret in the game. \n\nIt feels like SOTN. Not a complete recreation, but an overall vibe. The environments are beautiful, there are a ton of enemies and bosses to fight, tons of gear, shards and secrets. Many nods to SOTN, some a little less obvious than others. But it's got it's own, unique feel, it's own personality, much more inline with the handheld iterations of Castlevania than SOTN. \n\nI can't say it's better than SOTN, that's a very lofty goal and though it puts up one heck of a fight, it has yet to take that crown. Maybe future DLC will help level the playing field a little, only time will tell. But that does NOT mean it's inferior. It's got a lot going for it, it just needs a little bit more of what it's already got. I'd LOVE to see the castle extended, add new sidequests and enemies and bosses and gear. Maybe a few more playable characters? It's hard to say we got shorted, it's a very large game and there's a ton to do, but maybe that's one of the ways to tell it's a good game, the fact that I still want more after an entire work week's worth of time into it.  It feels short somehow, like it didn't take long to beat it, but I'm POSITIVE it's longer than SOTN. Maybe it's because I spent years playing SOTN over and over again until I had every single step memorized? This game has a ton to offer, I'd just love to see it expanded and elaborated on, maybe with another ending that adds more space to the castle, or a new area altogether that gives us more to explore. Maybe expand on the crafting system or add additional recipes? Hard as it is to imagine, more varied shards for more variation in tactics? More secrets?\n\ntl;dr This game is awesome, my only complaint is that it's not like 20 times longer and bigger because it's great and I want more.",Recommended

From what I've heard they are coming over time as DLC and by then. I will probably no longer have any interest in even coming back.\n\nPros:\nSecrets, wow the secrets\nContent for weapons/cooking/ect is pretty good\n\nNeutral:\nCombat - slow paced(con) but tactically good(pro)\n\nI wish i could give a flat neutral recommendation for this game. I'm going to give it a negative because the price is pretty steep. Yes it's a good game but $40 is just to high.\n\nThe fact that they released it essentially unfinished and call all other aspects DLC's that should be part of the base game is a MASSIVE NO for me.",Not Recommended

"If you have ever played a Metroidvania style game especially an ""Igavania"" and had a good time this game will not disappoint.\n\nI did have the game crash on me at one point but I lowered my setting a little and never had a issue since. This wasn't really a surprise considering how old my processor is. My only two other gripes would be sometimes it seems like you have hit an enemy and no damage is dealt that would be ok if it was guarded but the hit just never registered. The last gripe is when enemies drop items and they get stuck in walls, ceilings or floors, but this is kind of fixed later in the game when you get an item that automatically picks up items and gold when you get near it, you still might have to wait 3 to 8 seconds before it actually shows that you picked it up but its better than nothing. Hopefully these last two gripes will be fixed with an update.\n\nDon't listen to anyone that says its short they probably only played till the ""bad ending"". Being an experienced Igavania player it still took me about 30 hours to complete to the Recommended ""good"" ending.",Recommended

"This game is outstanding. 29 hours on the first play through with a decent amount of grinding and shard collecting. It is the perfect spiritual successor to Symphony of the Night and Aria of Sorrow.

Igarashi and his team have done an amazing job in recreating the feeling of a classic Castlevania game while also creating something new and fresh, this is how you make a great Metroidvania and I cannot wait for the DLC packs.

"This game is a really well-done callback to metroidvania games from previous console generations.  It embraces some obtuse and hidden mechanics that older games would have made use of, and manages to be really fun the entire time,  There's a lot to learn here and a lot to like.  Looking forward to the download packs slated for the near future",Recommended
"This game is alright, but let me explain where I'm coming from. The last game of this type I played was Castlevania: SotN, lets say...20 years ago. I enjoyed the hell out of that game - and it's the reason I bought Bloodstained.\n\nSo how does it compare? The gameplay is pretty tight - you play 'female-not-Alucard' fighting against various ghouls and demons with weapons, treasure and magic you find in a haunted castle. The story is a bit contrived, and it lacks the expected background that Castlevania benefited from. Aesthetically, there isn't a major advance in character design in moving from 2d to 3d, but it offers some new level styles that couldn't be done back when I played SotN on the PS1.\n\nIs it worth it? I haven't beat it yet - so maybe it will get better. Running around the castle and collecting gear isn't all that appealing. There isn't enough of a sense of mystery, and the castle feels pretty linear - with one feat or ability leading not to a variety of paths, but to the next boss. I'll recommend it if you *loved* SotN, or want to try your first (Japanese) Metriodvania. If you're not a superfan of the genre, it's worth a try, but maybe wait for a sales price.",Recommended
Painfully short because the ride is so amazing you never want it to end.,Recommended
Yummy,Recommended
"As an avid fan of the Castlevania games on the GBA and DS, I had high hopes going into Bloodstained, and I'll be honest...This game met every one of them. Beautiful scenery, smooth controls, an interesting (albeit rather predictable) story, and plenty of subtle (and less subtle) references to its predecessors. \n\nMy only complaint: Repetitive dialog from a couple of villagers.

"Amazing game, Very Metroidvania. Have many Symphony of the Night vibes. Worth every penny!",Recommended
"As one of the few who bought this game that didn't play Symphony of the Night, I can wholeheartedly say that this game holds up. I'm told there are a great many references to SotN, which I suppose is a plus if you enjoyed that.\nThe game does have a bit of grind, however. You want powerful shards? More food for that old lady? Wanna avenge the townsfolk and brings mementos for them to lay them to rest? It's all a grind. Granted, all of that is side quest fluff that isn't crucial to the game, but the time it takes for some food ingredient and material grind can feel like ages for someone who isn't used to it. I was accepting of how long it takes to get some of these things, and the game does at least tell you the drop rate of every item and shard in the game, as well as who drops it and where. The techniques that you can use for weapons are, at least in my experience, not as effective as just running up and using a normal attack. The map is sprawling, with varied environments and an excellent soundtrack. The movement abilities you unlock as you progress are put to good use everywhere on the map; even the beginning area has some secrets left for later on. Backtracking and searching for hidden rooms will make up most of your time if you wish to 100% this game. Bosses aren't particularly hard, but I've only beaten the game on normal so far, so maybe the game's Recommended intended experience is hard or nightmare. If you get stuck, NPC dialogue usually gives hints as to where you need to go, although one part was a little irritating for me because it wasn't really hinted at what you needed. I managed to brute force my way through that part without the necessary item, though, so I can't complain too much. There's a new game plus, a post game boss you can fight after you clear the game who's very difficult, and a boss rush and speed run mode. Apparently we're getting free dlc after launch as well, which is great. Just icing on the cake, as even with just the base game, there's enough content for the asking price.",Recommended

"Okay so my whole shtick is reviewing game scripts. That's what this is. My general opinion of the game is:\n-It's great. Good time, man. Not quite Symphony of the Night, but up there with Aria of Sorrow.\n-Some of the music's phenomenal, some of it's actually kinda bad.\n-Graphics are fine. I prefer 2D art for this kind of game, but there's a LOT of love here.\n-I don't have shit to say against the gameplay.\n-My friends tell me it's buggy but I haven't run into that.\n\nAnd for transparency's sake, I was a backer. (This is also the reason I'm not checking ""received for free"" as I paid for it. Just, you know, a really long time ago.)\nOnto the show. Spoilers from here on out.\n\nIt's been my opinion for a while that the skill of ""Writing"", not only for video games but for anything, is that writing is composed of two often-very-separate disciplines: Dialogue and Storytelling. This can also be represented as ""The Personal"" and ""The Stakes"", in my opinion. Writing for characters and writing for plot. The dialogue is fine. The personal back-and-forth is totally fine, even fun at times. It's the storytelling that, at times, really shines *and* really suffers.\n\nThe plot is actually kind of great. In the simplest and easiest to understand terms, a magic castle appears now go find the bad guy. What subtly sets this structure apart and is also, unfortunately, the source of a great many of my frustrations, for me, is the bad guy himself, Gebel, and his stated and conditional intention to listen to reason. Our main character, Miriam, has a history with Gebel, and many overlapping qualities and experiences. She alone has the key to his frozen heart due to her shared experiences and her history with him. She alone may be able to speak reason into this darkened soul.\n\nGebel, himself, knows this. He's willing to listen only under the condition that Miriam could undergo some strange facsimile of what he's experienced in her ten-year absence and not find herself swayed to the same bitter influence that Gebel himself has fallen to.\n\nSuddenly, the castle is no longer a simple obstacle set in place between protagonist and antagonist to delay the final encounter, but a sort of mytho-poetic trial grounds, where not only will Miriam's might be tested, but her will as well. It's a simple but effective way to add profundity and weight to a set-up that's been seen before.\n\nMy frustrations with the script come with everything that distracts from this enticing set-up. Continuing dialogues with Gebel make clear that he will not be the final confrontation. Arthur, an antagonist who's fun enough on his own, is made frustrating by his comparative lack of character hook or twist. There's also, simply, the fact that Gebel is, for much of the time, an absentee villain. Compare Royce Bracket (Transistor), Handsome Jack (Borderlands 2), Sephiroth (Final Fantasy VII) and Radioman (Spec Ops: The Line). Each of these villains appears at specific times, has a different level of villainy, has their part to play in their story and is able to effectively build up tension toward their confrontation.\n\nComparatively, Gebel sets up a grand and intriguing hook for his confrontation and allows time and circumstance to gently chip away at the tension until it occurs and then manages to not be the final battle.\n\nThe script is otherwise fine, works a standard theme as well as you'd expect, and even shines in a few places. Quickly, for efficiency's sake:\n\nPros-\n-Ansiliary characters such as O.D. and Todd are fun.\n-Get the victorian dialect fine enough.\n-Miriam is not unlikable by any stretch.\n-In fact there are no characters that could be described as grating or intolerable. Everyone's fine enough to be around. You may even find yourself caring about some of them.\n\nCons-\n-Miriam is not given enough spoken or visual personality.\n-Dialogues can run long without giving relevant or interesting information.\n-Breaks the cardinal rule of video game writing: Make the stated objective or tutorial as clear as humanly possible.\n\nTo summarize: not a bad script at all, but an occasionally frustrating one. Provides enough context to make an already great game feel cohesive and epic.\n\nGreat game overall, man.",Recommended

Despite all this, once I did get the game up and running, I was reminded why I loved Iga's games so much. \n\nThis truly does feel like a proper entry into the Metroidvania games that he helped popularize, it's an unapologetic Castlevania SOTN-style game. It was an absolute pleasure to finish this game, nearing 100% completion of my normal playthrough. While I didn't experience any tremendous difficulty spikes or hurdles, the games bosses were a fun challenge and exploring the entirety of the castle was a great time.

The addition of side quests and crafting make this a worthy addition to any fan of the Metroidvania game genre.  \n\nIf I was going to make any criticism of the game it's that there's a pacing issue for a stretch where there is far more exploration than fighting bosses and if you're an achievement hunter  the endgame can start feeling like a chore.  Still, I highly recommend it.\n\n",Recommended
"This game is awesome, Koji Igarashi definitely delivered with this game! Highly recommend!!!",Recommended
"I was very apprehensive about this game during development. I didn't like the art style and any time there was a vid it seemed very underwhelming to me. I was afraid this would end up being another Kickstarter disappointment ala Mighty No. 9.  I'm glad to say, I was completely wrong about this game. This is nearly everything I could have hoped for in a spiritual successor to SoTN. In motion this game looks so much better than I thought it was going to. The backgrounds in this game are beautiful, and the enemy designs are great. The gameplay is 100% dead-on faithful to the games it seeks to emulate, and the RPG elements are very addictive. I constantly want to farm materials to craft the next item, or rank up my shards (basically equipable abilities). This game is an absolute joy to play.\n\nHighly recommended, and I hope there is plenty more in store for this franchise.",Recommended

"Short Version:\nBloodstained: Ritual of the Night is a strong example of the style of Metroidvania that was used for the Castlevania series during Koji Igarashi's tenure as producer, to the extent that it can often feel like a sort of greatest hits mix of several titles in that series.\nMany aspects of the game's mechanics and story are recycled from Castlevania, but there are still some fresher additions, although these go underutilised in some cases.\nWhether the remix aspect of the game is a strength or a weakness is heavily in the eye of the beholder.\nFor me personally, this was a welcome return to a specific style of game that I'd been missing for years.\n",Recommended
What is a man?\n\nA miserable little pile of secrets!,Recommended
Its pretty good.,Recommended
"Finally got around to beating the game, and I must say it did not disappoint. Fans of Castlevania symphony of the night or the other Castlevania games that have the same game play will love this game.  Even if you haven't played any of them, Bloodstained is a great game to play regardless, if you like these types of games. Theirs much to explore, secrets to find, and many ways to go about playing. The variety of equipment and shard builds is huge.  All around a great game with great designs and music.  I hope that the game takes off, and we can get a sequel in the future.",Recommended
Awesome!,Recommended
"As the real spiritual successor for SotN, Bloodstained is an amazing surprise to Alucard's fans.\n\nThe game has an good balance between weapon and skill variety as well as challenging enemies, which will guarantee many hours of fun for any Metroidvania fan. it also has a nice replayability, having three difficulty levels and three different characters, even though only Mirian is the only one available by the time I wrote this review.\n\nPlease treat yourself with this game, seriously.",Recommended
"Good Game, can breeze through it fast or play it slow and explore for everything.",Recommended
"A bit on the easier side of Metroidvanias, but definitely engaging and cozy",Recommended
"I own this game on the Switch (for portability). This game was so good I did not mind paying twice just so I could have it rendered beautifully on a 2k+ screen. It is a fantastic spiritual successor to the RPG-era Castlevania games. If you enjoyed SotN, Aria/Dawn of Sorrow, Order of Ecclesia, or Portrait of Ruin, I think you will also like Bloodstained: RotN. Even if you are not an avid Castlevania fan, Bloodstained is definitely a wonderfully made game that can stand on its own.\n\nSince it is a Castlevania game in everything but name, I will be comparing it to its predecessors a lot.\n\nMiriam is clearly inspired by Shanoa and Soma, in a good way. Despite drawing similar origins from these characters, she is unique enough to stand as a solid protagonist, but not so unique that it feels forced. Miriam retains the same improbable Castlevania-protagonist movesets, with slide-kicking, back-sliding, and dive-kicking (unlike a certain WWII era teen witch).\n\nMiriam can use s̶o̶u̶l̶s shards to do a variety of attacks and functions, but if you do not like b̶e̶i̶n̶g̶ ̶t̶h̶e̶ ̶d̶a̶r̶k̶ ̶l̶o̶r̶d spamming shards repeatedly, there are weapon techniques. Me being bad at fighting games means I just stuck with shard abuse. Shards work very much like in Dawn of Sorrow, and the weapon techniques are very much like SotN.\n\nAlthough most armors in this game are rendered the same as her base dress, there are a few interesting outfits that have their own unique palette. Hopefully they add even more.\n\nThe Clock Tower section is no longer the most dangerous section in the game. That title now goes to the accursed spike-filled library or the lava-filled lethality land with the really narrow platforms before you get actual ways to circumnavigate them entirely.\n\nThis game has a surprising number of references, and they were included in a fairly non-intrusive way.\n\nThere are also a lot of hidden events and locked rooms, perfect for driving completionists mad. At no point is a room truly empty; if not for the items and hidden events, they often can be farmed for shards and valuable reagents. Backtracking can be quite rewarding, so feel free to re-explore as you like.\n\nPerhaps my favorite change from the late-era Castlevania games was the inclusion of respawning chests. These give you a reason to backtrack, as well as providing a steady source of materials for crafting and removing a lot of frustration that results from RNG and bad drop rates. The crafting recipes themselves often range from simple to aggravatingly expensive, but they are naturally solved by shard-grinding or backtracking, eliminating a lot of the time wasted like in Dawn of Sorrow or especially Portrait of Ruin.\n\nThis game was unfortunately a bit beefy for the Switch, struggling to render water-heavy areas or anything with lots of moving objects. This is especially bad on the exterior of the Clock Tower and obligatory Water-Filled Caves sections, and sometimes the game will crash with extended periods of play. PC does not seem to have this problem, although your mileage may vary.\n\nOn the other hand, the PC's controls were well thought out, but the mouse itself feels less natural than analog stick usage. This means that while directional shards on the Switch (or controller) are preferred, on a keyboard/mouse setup it is a bit more difficult to quick-aim your shots. It is recommended to play this on a gaming controller for this exact reason.\n\nAll in all, it is a fantastic metroidvania successor that has its own story while having natural parallels to its predecessors. In many ways, it is a refinement of the concept that eliminates a lot of unnecessary baggage while keeping the core elements of the genre.\nDefinitely 10/10.",Recommended

I am so happy with this. I haven't finished it yet but they kept their promise. I prefer this game taking 5 years then coming out early and incomplete. It feels like an advanced better made version of symphony of the night with the kinks removed and lots more added. i missed having this kind of fun in ages. Go IGA. Hope this starts becoming a standard in gaming and that the existence of this game stops making companies claim that anti consumer tactics and micro-transactions are needed. So glad I was part of the kickstarter 5 years ago. Totally worth the investment.,Recommended
I got 100% and I want to do it again. I'm love this game,Recommended

Brilliant! \n,Recommended
"[h1] Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night - A game for modern Castlevania Fans! [/h1] \nI have greatly enjoyed my experience with this game. It provides many of the gameplay mechanics from the castlevania rpgs. The ""soul capture"" and crafting mechanics in this game make it feel incredibly enjoyable for those who rush through the game, allowing for varied playthroughs based on the items and shards dropped. If one is more inclined to be a completionist it will also be enjoyable with the sheer amount of things to collect.\nThe music and voice acting isn't the greatest, and the voice acting in particular may break immersion, but it is servicable. \nThe gameplay will be very familiar to anyone who has played 2-D Castlevania games from Symphony of the Night onward. It is snappy, allows for familiar movement and attacks, and has a special skill system which gives a tactical edge for those willing to master the button combos.\nThe art style is different than previous Castlevania games, particularly the character models. In my personal opinion I found the characters typically to be either too busy or bland, but this is all a matter of personal preference. The only thing I would change with the character customization is to have vanity slots so you can have the appearance you want while having the stats and effects which you want.\n\nOverall I would give this game an 8/10 for the extremely fun gameplay, atmosphere, and proper consumer focus which you'll seldom find in modern games.",Recommended

"If you only have one trick, it better be a good one. Luckily for fans of Metroidvania, Iga remains the king of the genre. There are many imitators and some downright classics in the genre, but Iga still has a magic touch that puts him above the rest. Sometimes surprisingly ugly, but plays exactly like the bigger, better sequel to SOTN we never got.",Recommended
"This is a library, not a bookshop.",Recommended
"One of the best games to come out this year. The metroidvania genre has evolved tremendously since the early days of metroid and castlevania and this is an old school take with a fresher coat of paint. It may not be as revolutionary as hollow knight or other newer versions of this style, but is a great time nonetheless.  Worthy of a shot if you are into the genre, and who isn't?",Recommended
"Do you miss the Castlevania games from GBA, or perhaps, the PSX ones, well, this is your luck day... Bloodstained: ROTN is everything you wished for, with accurate controls, lots of customization options, and tons of ""familiar"" enemies, this game will get you entertained for a long time, and asking yourself why Konami didn't make something like this before. Well, congratulations to Mr. Igarashi for this great game and already waiting for the sequel.",Recommended

"Manages to keep the feel of Symphony of the Night without the classic difficulty struggles.\nYou can get that back by turning up the difficulty levels, of course. :D\n\nPlatforming is precise without requiring pixel perfect jumps especially after unlocking more navigation abilies.\n\nItem / Skill collection is part of the game though it is not required to complete it. Simply using what you find along the way is more than enough if you don't want to bother with hunting down particular items or materials.\n\nIf you wander around the whole area in general before moving on, like I do, completion time 20 - 30 hours.\nYou can easily cut that down if you're feeling driven as boss room doors are easily identified.\nIf you're after everything then you've got a lot of hours to burn as the item collection aspect can mean some dedicated farming.",Recommended
"understandably some bogs that will surly get ironed out in updates, a recommend nonetheless.",Recommended
"I can describe my experience with this game as very satisfying even though it needs some fixes and polishmets\n\nThe game is an excelent example of it's genre. It's awesome in terms of gameplay and content. Even difficulty is shaped the way you can either dive into adventure or give yourself a challange. However the game rewards you mostly for exploration rather than challenge, so if you're not a hardcore gamer you're not losing anything if you love to find and collect everything game has.\n\nStill it loses in atmosphere at some points especially in graphics. The game tries to be dark and misterious but theres something in visuals that makes it too vivid and just ruins it somehow. But the music is awesome and fits the atmosphere well turning it more dynamic and gives you that urge of adventure.\n\nThe story isn't something too exciting but it still does it's work in keeping you around to discover what's going on or what's going to happen. But don't expect anything super cool and fantastic. I could say the same about the characters still their design is pretty neat\n\nAt the moment there's some unpleasant bugs especially audio and performance ones, but they don't make the game unplayable or unpleasant to play yet trey're quite annoying and i hope they'll meet their fixes\n\nAnd yeah to be straight it's a mix of Symphony of the Night and Aria of Sorrow with Shanoa with Soma's abilities (figuratively) as a main character. And yeah... JoJo references",Recommended
"When I beat the game first time, I thought was this it? Was this game really this short and easy? Then I looked my map coverage and found that is was just 50,4% complete. Now its 79% complete and I´m stuck with some mean and bad a*s boss.\n\nGraphics are stunning and music is awesome. Its just like playing Symphony Of The Night the first time.\n\nBuy it! You wont regret it, if you love metroidvania!",Recommended
"[h1] Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night is a metroidvania action game for the lovers of the genre. This game is strongly focused on the exploration and backtracking mechanics, which is a typical thing for metroidvania games. [/h1]\n\n[b] Pros: [/b]\n\n+ A huge map that is very interesting to explore and reveal something new \n+ Astonishing level design with interconnected rooms and areas \n+ The variety of enemies is simply incredible\n+ Memorable atmosphere  \n+ Great title for the Castlevania lovers\n+ Reasonable difficulty\n+ A fair amount of content\n\n[b] Cons: [/b]\n\n- Can be a bit hard for the players who are not familiar with the genre\n- Requires lots of backtracking\n- Graphics look weird sometimes\n\nBloodstained: Ritual of the Night is a project that players have been waiting for five years. It was backed on the Kickstarter back in the days and it had a lot of problems and issues during its development. There were a lot of changes and lots of turnarounds have been made to finish the game and now, when it’s finally here I can freely say that it was worth waiting.\n\nThe game is, obviously, a perfect pick for metroidvania lovers and Castlevania fans with its classic mechanics and staples. Koji Igarashi did a pretty great job here and it will be a memorable nostalgic journey for the old school players. \n\n[h1] Story [/h1]\n\nThe protagonist of the game, the young orphan girl Miriam has been taken by Alchemists' Guild. They were experimenting on here and this was the reason for her falling into a coma. Ten years later, the moment she awakes, she realizes that she was cursed and that her body has been cursed and the only reason she was still alive was an alchemist called Johannes, who was supporting her body for all these years. \n\nThe only way to break the curse is to gather magic shards from the demons who have been summoned into this world by Gebel who has been a normal human before the alchymist experiments as well. So Miriam has to travel to Demon's Castle to find all these shards, get rid of the curse and stop this whole madness at once.\n\n[h1] Gameplay [/h1]\n\nBloodstained: Ritual of the Night is the game about exploration first of all and that's probably the main thing I love about this game. Straight after the first minutes of a brief introduction to the game, the player finds themselves in a huge castle, full of diverse levels and enemies. The overall design of the levels is absolutely amazing. All these levels are interconnected and the player can always find secret passages and hidden doors to make themselves shortcuts for faster relocations. \n\nThere is something oddly satisfying in exploring this map and I really enjoy that feeling of being lost for a very long time without a single idea of where to go next and then when you finally see a small location that you missed somehow, it's absolutely great and feels rewarding. Other than that, every single level has save points represented as red rooms with a sofa and teleports represented as green rooms with stained glass windows. \n\nCombat is another thing that is greatly designed in this game. Bloodstained has an insane amount of different and creative enemies, some of them can even surprise you a lot as they look as an homage to popular videogames characters. There are also enemies which look very cute, you will probably know who I was talking about the moment you start playing the game, however, this does not negate the fact that they are absolutely dangerous. \n\nWhat I appreciate about Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night the most is the fact that the game has tons of different items dropping from the enemies which allow you to customize Miriam anyway that you like and experiment with her powers. The thing is that enemies also drop shards which give Miriam powers and unique abilities and those abilities are fun and unique as well. Of course, most of them copy the idea of each other, but in general, there are plenty of them and the player always has something to choose from. \n\nSpeaking of items and weapons dropping from the enemies, it won’t harm to say that the game really cares about players’ playstyle and about the way they want to progress through the story. The player can always choose from quick daggers to slow two-handed weapons or even ranged weapons, etc. However, I was not a big fan of ranged weapons and never cared too much of using them through my playthrough.\n\nOne of the most confusing parts of the game is its side quests, where the player has to talk to one of the survivors in the secret hideout and take a new task. These tasks are completely generic and boring, nothing creative or unique about them and they always follow the same path - kill a certain amount of enemies, come back to me and get your reward. Rewards may vary - it may be something useful such as rare ingredients or powerful weapon and it also can be something absolutely shallow that you won’t need at all.  \n\nThis hideout can also be used to upgrade your items, weapons, and shards to make Miriam more powerful. A local merchant can sell you goods and buy from you everything you don’t need. There is also a possibility to craft some food which is very important in this game because they give you a permanent boost.  \n\nThe game has a decent amount of content and I am still on my way to exploring the whole map on 100% and achieve everything in this game and as far as I know, there is going to be even more content soon. It’s hard to determine how much time will it take for an average player to finish this game because it strongly depends on player’s skill and how fast they will come up with finding the right route or solving some puzzles. \n\nI guess my biggest complaint regarding this game was that it felt a bit difficult for me, but it was only during the beginning. When I leveled up a bit and realized how everything works it became much easier for me and then I started to truly enjoy the game.  \n\n[h1] Graphics [/h1]\n\nThe game is very atmospheric and graphics play a significant role in this: that gothic-styled castle alongside creepy and disgusting demons set the right mood for the entire game. I can’t say that graphics is perfect here though, some of the characters look pretty rough and unpolished, but keeping in mind that the game used to have a completely different visual starter at the beginning it’s not that bad at all. \n\n[h1] Sound [/h1]\n\nI can’t say I am a big fan of the sound design in Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night with its repetitive music here and there and voice acting that is not memorable at all. It’s not a masterpiece and it’s not bad at all, it just does its job and that’s all that you have to ask for a game like this. \n\n[h1] Conclusion [/h1]\n\nBloodstained: Ritual of the Night is a Recommended masterpiece for the genre lovers, which can be a bit frustrating or difficult for the new players. It has a pretty interesting setting, great variety of demons and monsters and the exploration thing is absolutely rewarding. It’s highly recommended for all the Castlevania fans and for someone who is looking for a good metroidvania game. \n\n[h1] Enjoy!

"Truly a game for fans of the series. Hardcore aficionados will notice the references to pretty much every Castlevania game directed by Iga (and some that aren't as well), with gameplay elements borrowing heavily from all ""Metroidvania"" games starting from Symphony of the Night and going all the way down to Order of Ecclesia, with all the quality-of-life improvements you would expect from a more modern game.\nFrom a technical standpoint, it doesn't really feel like a ""2019"" game, albeit the gameplay hardly suffers.\nIf you love the genre, especially the original Castlevania ones (as opposed games that borrow from them) you will feel back home with this game. If you never liked the older ones and wanted to check whether this one was any different... well, steer clear of Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night.",Recommended

I'm definitely excited for the future of Bloodstained after both this game and Curse of the Moon. Highly recommend this game to fans of metroidvania's, Castlevania, or fans of just great platforming fun.",Recommended
Great game.,Recommended
"This game is fantastic. If you like Metroidvanias, you will absolutely love this game. Also you can turn into Shovel Knight, so that's a plus.",Recommended
"I'm a Kickstarter backer and I'm satisfied.\n\nBloodstained is a 2d metroidvania, unsurprisingly similar to other IGA games. There's a lot of variety and stuff to explore. There's some platforming but not a lot, so don't worry if that isn't your sort of thing. I'd easily recommend it to anybody who likes any Metroidvania game.\n\nIt's very console-oriented, but a decent port. There's no mouse support in menus but it's playable with keyboard and mouse. The mouse emulates a joystick and is a little awkward at it. Getting keyboard bindings set up at the start is annoying, and if your keyboard doesn't have multiple key rollover you'll encounter problems. At least enter and the arrow keys are hardcoded to reasonable values.\n\nJohannes's name is mispronounced in the English dub, it's very strange. Compare to the Japanese audio.\n\nAround the midpoint of the game there's a mobility item that drops from a regular enemy, and you might not get it to drop or overlook its importance. [spoiler]The shard is Aqua Stream and it drops from the blue jellyfish things.[/spoiler]\n\nDespite these flaws this is a very good game.",Recommended

"I haven't left a review before, but here we go.\n\nBeen waiting for this game since it's original Kickstarter announcement forever ago, and feel like it's been worth the wait.\n\nThe game feels very much in touch with that old school roots it was going for; and feels like a mix between a Megaman game, and Castlelvania, made all the better with the abilities of modern programming.\n\nThe controls are buttery smooth, and pacing feels very on point. \nAt the beginning of the game swapping weapons and abilities felt a little tedious, but this slowly alleviated once the ""Shortcut"" ability a few bosses in, which allows you to swap between your own custom presets on the fly; which is when the game really opens up in terms of gameplay.\n\nEvery monster and enemy in the game has a unique spell that it can drop; and each one of those can be enhanced, and powered up in several ways to really give a unique gameplay experience to everyone who plays.\n\nCouple that with all the different weapon types, that have hidden abilities behind ""Street Fighter""-esk button combos for even more diverse gameplay.\n\nAll in all, I give the game \nArt 10/10\nGameplay 10/10\nStory 9/10\nControls 10/10\nU.I. 9/10\nDifficulty 9/10\n\nFor an overall 9/10.\nOutstanding game, I am very impressed.\n",Recommended

Do you like SotN or Aria? Then why don't you have this yet,Recommended
Great game.,Recommended
"Easily 8/10 for me\n\nBloodstained is the resurrection of Castlevania post-era (the Metroidvania style) with voice acting, polished gameplay, and re-imagined visual as well as lore and world design.\n\nYou traverse through interconnected zones to find new items/abilities; and then unlock new zones.\nThe map is big and full of stuffs to discover. Though some zones are too small, you'll feel that you want more of those zones.\nLevel design is good; fun to explore around and suitable monster placements.\nIf you like 2D action-adventure, you could easily sink 7-10 hours+ with the journey through good ending.\n\nAs Koji Igarashi said that he's bringing back the ""IGAvania"" back to life it is seemingly hard not to compare Bloodstained to its ancestors; the Metroidvania-Castlevania\n\nBloodstained shares clear similarities to 2 of its predecessors; Castlevania: Symphony of the Night & Castlevania: Aria of Sorrow\n- Weapons are many to choose like Symphony of the Night as well as Weapon Skills.\n- Secrets and Easter Eggs needed attention and a bit of creativity to uncover them.\n- Character Progressions, abilities, and customization are like in Aria of Sorrow\n\nWhen compare these elements with its predecessors, Bloodstained is;\n\n- Inferior in Weapons system than Symphony of the Night. While there are many weapons to choose from in the two games, Symphony of the Night has more Unique weapons which you can input button combinations to create special effects only when specific weapons are equipped wheres in Bloodstained you can only use the same arts you have mastered with the same type of weapon (excluding Bandit Blade). Bloodstained also lacks Dual-Equipped ability & Shield equipment.\n\n- Inferior in Secrets & Easter Eggs than Symphony of the Night. The granddaddy of IGAvania has 'too many' secrets that you wound't uncover in your 1st playthrough if you are not a total hardcore gamer or lucky bastard. It is the charm of Symphony of the Night where it always questions us whether this room/ object / items / ability could hold some secrets to one another. Bloodstained does not have this many subtle secrets within the game (although it does have few amount of it, and I'm very happy to see one secret boss 'Revenant')\n\n- Superior in Character Progression & Customization. Bloodstained has done well in how it allows players to customize their abilities to suit their play-styles. You can equip up to three abilities & 1 summoned familiar (excluding passive abilities which become permanent when you leveled it up to maximum). Speed Runner would find joys in this which they could try out as many combination as possible with many equally powerful setup.\n\nAs for the music; Bloodstained has good writing in its scrolls, however, from my sole opinion, Castlevania: Symphony of the Night still having the best OST than any other counterparts.\n\n[Conclusion - TL;DR]\n\n-New to Castlevania & Enjoy 2D Exploring/Action? Buy this game; it will sink you at least 7-10 Hours.\n\n-Fan of Metroidvania? Buy this game; you will enjoy it at some extent.\n\n-Like this game but never played Symphony of the Night before? Do yourself a favor and PLAY IT!",Recommended
"Cool game, beautiful, fun  A++\n\nSome of the progression abilities/powers are only used in 1 or 2 specific spots, then never again\n\nwas expecting NG+ enemies to be harder (more life / more dmg, etc), but enemies and bosses go down in 1 hit in NG+ until late-game (NG+ on nightmare diff, which forces you to lvl 1 and no exp is still too easy, would be good for just NG). Don't bother doing NG+, just do a NG on the harder difficulties when you unlock them\n\nadditional planned features/dlc looks neat",Recommended
"I love Symphony of the Night. It will always be a game that holds a special place in my heart. All I wanted was to feel the same love for Bloodstained that I felt for SotN.\n\nI am happy to say that I felt that again with Bloodstained. It's not perfect and it's not quite SotN. However, it packs in great gameplay, a beautiful score, and bountiful secrets. I love it.",Recommended
Awesome Catlevania-esque game.  Definitely worth taking the time to fully complete.,Recommended
Its Castlevania with the serial numbers filed off.,Recommended
"Hands down the best Metroidvania game to come out in ages, though with Igarashi behind it there's little surprise there. The game is a love letter to those who enjoyed Symphony of the Night, as well as Metroidvania fans in general. The art is beautiful, the music hauntingly beautiful, and the world feels great. The controls, likewise, are very well done and tight. Movement is fluid and, as you unlock more powers, fast and rewarding. Combat is tight and each weapon offers a different play-style to suit you. The magic system, referred to as Shards, is also well done. Since you can collect multiple Shards to power up your abilities this can create a bit of a grind, but that's only if you choose to do so since the powering up does taper off. My only real complaint with the game comes down to the length as of right now, but honestly that might just be because I want more. If you enjoy single player games or just Metroidvania games in general, you definitely owe it to yourself to play Bloodstained.",Recommended
"This is the spiritual successor to the old Igavania titles we wanted when we backed this on Kickstarter.  It blends mechanics from Symphony of the Night, Aria and Dawn of Sorrow, and Order of Ecclesia to make a truly fantastic experience for those of us who love the genre.

"Let me start by saying, i'm a huge fan of the Castlevania series, and even more importantly, i'm a massive fan of Symphony of the Night. This game is the greatest love letter that could have been written to that game with even more things to do. The crafting is great, the combat is great, the music is great, and while I realize it seems like i'm fan-boying, (Which is probably the case xD), I think this game lives up to the expectations a lot of us had going into it. Admittedly, I was worried it wasn't gonna live up to what I wanted, but it's a homerun for me. 10/10.\n\nPS. Lmao @ Gamespot for giving it a 6/10. Just more proof that with movies, and games, we don't need 'professional' critics to tell us what to consume.",Recommended

"finally, another good castlevania game",Recommended
"Bloodstained is a classic, old school Metroidvania game. No Dark Souls inspired combat, no procedurally generated anything, no autosaves, and, annoyingly, no hotkeys to use a damn potion. It's carefully plotted, carefully designed, and for the most part a fantastic hit of nostalgia.\n\nThe combat is exciting, with a pretty wide variety of techniques to master, though some weapons do get short shrift in this department. The shard system, which adds bonuses to melee combat as well as forming the backbone of the game's magic system, gives you a fantastic amount of character customization if you want it but can largely be ignored (I went through the entire game and the post game content with magic attacks from the first area of the game) if you don't feel like fiddling with the menus too much.\n\nExploration is fun and rewarding, you have plenty of impetus to go back to previous areas later on. Also, the backgrounds in this thing are almost always fun, and sometimes just plain glorious. Aside from hunting for secret rooms and grabbing every chest, it's neat just to see what you can interact with.\n\nThe game has a few shortcomings. A lot of the bonus content (Looking at you, ""key"" bosses) isn't as carefully thought out. Frankly, it's pretty easy to cheese a lot of these bonus boss fights with the invert power, which you will definitely have before you can get to them. The game's plot...is there...to a certain extent. And lastly, there were a few places where the game still had some obnoxious bugs, particularly one where item drops from airborne creatures or creatures on certain uneven terrain would freeze in midair and not be collectible.\n\nOn a personal note, I really didn't like Miriam's character design. Hypersexualized characters are der riguer in this medium, and that's fine, but the first time she popped up on screen I actually had to call my fiancee over so we could both have a solid laugh at the outfit. I dubbed it Murder Maid, she went with ""pulled from the collective id of every horny 12 year old in America.""\n\nMy run clocked in at just over 23 hours, with one optional boss left unfound and about a dozen cooking/item fetching sidequests unbothered with. I imagine that people who weren't obsessively farming rare drops for the crafting system could get that under 20 for a nice, leisurely stroll through the interdimensional hell castle (Side note: why is there a church in the hell castle?) Occasionally, on normal mode, the game felt challenging, but never difficult. I'd probably recommend playing it on a higher difficulty if you're coming from something like Dead Cells or Hollow Knight.\n\nIn conclusion: The game is a blast! Great combat, thoughtful level design, deep systems that you can dive into if you want, but will be fine just skimming the surface of. It's not AAA title length, but for the price it offers plenty of replayability and the promise of a great many free DLCs to come. If you like Metroidvnias, I highly recommend this one.",Recommended

The villain(s) in this game aren't as interesting as Castlevania's Dracula.  I mean, just look at the Castlevania anime.",Recommended

"First Castlevania game, and not disappointed.",Recommended
"Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night is a solid throwback to the days of old Igavania games, as it should be as a project spearheaded by the man, the myth, the legend himself, Koji Igarashi.\n\nIt combines elements from both Symphony of the Night and Aria of Sorrow in exploration and gameplay mechanics, as well as doing a few things to keep itself fresh and exciting with the use of modern technology that wasn't available when Castlevania was at its peak.\n\nWhen trailers for the game were first shown, there was a bit of concern over the visuals, and for good reason, as Inti Creates was not used to working with Unreal as shown in the blunder that was Mighty No. 9. Though Inti Creates has made some pretty solid traditional 2D games in their history. All this aside, the game got delayed for a year+ before they dropped another trailer in early 2019, showing far better graphics and gameplay, instilling a far better impression for the game.\n\nNow that the game is released and I've sunk a good number of hours trying to 100% the game, I can most certainly recommend it to both old fans of the Metroidvania/Igavania genre, as well as newcomers. I've definitely enjoyed the time I've put in, and look forward to new content as it gets released.",Recommended
"Pretty solid metroidvania. Decent amount of content. Not quite as challenging as previous Iga titles. Soundtrack is good but it doesn't have the same lasting power as CotM or SotN. Shard system is entertaining and arguably an improvement over Aria of Sorrow with the shortcut options. Movement and controls are pretty clean. The ""quests"" seem like a lazy add-in without much depth. Crafting is a nice option but definitely feels more like a grind than anything, like having to farm multiple components as opposed to just one drop (I'm looking at you two, flying beef and fiend heart).\n\nGame is somewhat buggy, as others have noted. I've had a few random crashes (reading bookshelves, softlock by losing control when skipping cutscene dialogue) but nothing so consistent as to be game breaking. \n\n7/10. Definitely pick it up if you're big on metroidvanias.",Recommended

"This game brings back so many fond memories, from Symphony of the Night to Order of Ecclesia, Bloodstained takes some of the best parts of the genre and mixes them into this beautiful masterpiece. From how this game feels so much like classic Iga titles to the few new elements they introduced. If you were a fan of any Castlevania titles from Symphony of the Night to the Nintendo DS Castlevania games, I would HIGHLY recommend playing Bloodstained. The gameplay pacing feels great, the music is amazing, enemy designs are fun, character customization options are a wonderful addition, the quests some incentive to seek out some of the high level/end game bosses.\n\nThere are a few odd things I've noticed playing though and wish would be addressed, though only one really seem necessary. One thing being that occasionally when you die the death animation fails and you still control your character for the few seconds before the game over screen shows. And the one big issue I had is enemy drops getting stuck on the environment and not picking up.\n\nAll in all though this game was a blast to play through, I'm sure I'll run through it a few more times and experiment with various options I didn't try the first time.",Recommended

You should be saving often anyway in a 'Vania right?)\nThe way the music and visuals come together to provide a unique atmosphere in each area is really well thought out.\nThere is some good humor mixed in to some of the dialog I wasn't expecting.\n\nThe..Eh...:\nGraphics are good, however the style seems a little cartoony. Not a negative just IMO should have looked a little grittier to fit the atmosphere of the game.\nThe platforming in the game doesn't feel very...sharp or responsive?

Its pretty much just there for context.\n\nSummary: If you like metroidvanias, you should look into this game.",Recommended

"I kickstartered from the very beginning. I had super high hopes that I desperately had to temper after seeing the first couple demos.\n\nHowever, the finished product exceeded all of my expectations. I loved this game. If you took the best parts of Symphony of the Night, Aria of Sorrow, and Order of Ecclesia, you would get this game. Plenty of easter eggs and nods to Castlevania. This is everything I could have wanted. I sincerely hope this is a new beginning.\n\nIf I had to have any complaints it would be very minor. The game has been out a couple weeks and still ignores multiple monitor preferences. I have to manually switch screens every time I boot the game. The swordwhip also cannot be obtained until late in the game and is strength-wise pretty irrelevant by that point. I received the whip for being a backer but I would be reasonably upset if I had paid extra for this item or the 1 fight worth of content the DLC adds.\n\nAll in all: This is everything I wanted from a massive SOTN/Castlevania fan, and more. I would highly recommend to anyone.",Recommended

"Everything this game went through in development made me skeptical of the game's quality, but as soon as I started playing, I could tell that this game is the Castlevania successor we've been waiting for.\n\nI'd describe the game as a mixture between the combat system of Dawn of Sorrow and the aesthetic of Order of Ecclesia, but expanded in both cases. You can tell a lot of thought and creativity went into this game, and the combat system allows you yourself to be creative in how you want to play, much more than most other games in the genre.\n\nMy primary complaint would be that there are two points in the game where you must do some non-intuitive things in order to progress, one of which is not very well hinted at (and I feel sometimes doesn't work right), but besides that one instance, the game does give you decent hints on where to go, if you want them. I've heard complaints about the graphics, but they don't bother me at all. I also found the normal difficulty to be a bit easy for a Castlevania-esque game, but I feel that it'd be about right for someone who's unfamiliar with the series. I would have done my first playthrough on hard if given the option.\n\nOverall, Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night is worth a try if you're a Castlevania fan, or a fan of the metroidvania genre in general. Definitely worth checking out.",Recommended

I was really sucked into the gameplay and it delivered on most things.\n\nThe game is flawed with a bit of lag and the graphics looking okay but not great. There are other flaws with the game but I found almost all of them excusable.\n\nIf you played Aria of Sorrow or Symphony of the Night and loved those games, you will enjoy Bloodstained Ritual of the Night. It has everything that made those games great.",Recommended
"Have you played Castlevania: Symphony of the Night?  Or any of the handheld Castlevanias that came after it like Harmony of Dissonance, Aria of Sorrow, Dawn of Sorrow, Portrait of Ruin, or Order of Ecclesia? If so, and if you liked them, then you would LOVE this.  Bloodstained: RotN is created by Koji Igarash (aka Iga), and he was the mastermind of the games listed above.  This is his first unofficial Castlevania game since his departure from Konami.\n\nFor those familiar with Iga's Castlevania games, this game takes a lot of the best parts from his previous games and mashes them together in this game.  The atmosphere of the castle itself feels most like the castle from Symphony of the Night.  The main character, Miriam, plays much like Soma from Aria of Sorrow and Dawn of Sorrow in that she gains abilities by defeating enemies and collecting their shards.  The quests and crafting materials found in the game is similar to Order of Ecclesia.  \n\nFor those who aren't familiar with Castlevania, this is the brainchild of the man who put the ""vania"" in ""Metroidvania"".  It's a side-scrolling action RPG in which you have to explore a large castle.  You will find passages and treasures that will tease you that you can't reach because you'll need a certain item or ability to gain access.  You will need to fully explore the castle to find the resources you need... which makes more and more of the castle available for exploration as you play and obtain items and abilities.\n\nI'm a backer of this game... as I was of Mighty No 9.  I was afraid this game might have the same fate as M#9, but I'm glad to say it has surpassed my expectations.  As of the time of this review, we still have free content that will be added in future updates, so I'm looking forward to seeing what else this game has to offer.  This should be the role model of how to do a KickStarter game correctly!",Recommended

"TL:DR It's SOtN 2 and it's glorious.\n\nI bought this game on a craving for a new and exciting experience, something to get hooked on. I got exactly what I wanted. A big open roundabout labyrinth, and a variety of cool powers to get around it with. Bosses are challenging, but fair, and usually give you access to really fun abilities. There's also very little cryptic nonsense. A few puzzles I figured out in seconds, things like ""find where the new door is. Maybe you've seen it already"" I did see the door, and knew exactly where it was. There was one instance of a key item being hidden in a corner in absolutely nowhere, the kind of hiding spot you'd only ever see if you were trying to 100% the game. Without it, I was able to damage boost to where I needed to be, and feel like an idiot later when I found out about the item, but that's just one blemish on an otherwise great game. Graphically, it looks great, but feels a bit jarring having such an... in your face 3D modelling look, from a game that's spiritual successor to a game that famously went with pixels in the dawn of the 3D age. Definitely if you love tight side scrolling swordplay, cool powers, and Metroidvanias in general, this is a good game to check out.",Recommended

Lots of weapon types to cater to lots of different play styles.  Symphony of the Night was one of my favorite games of the series and this seems to be very similar yet different enough to feel completely new and refreshing.  I totally recommend this game 100%.\n\nMy only complaint is that when you change the body armor in the game it doesn't change on the character.  Hats and scarfs etc do.  Would love to see them update this in a future patch.",Recommended
"Originally I thought: Yeah, it's just another Vania game. I, like many others probably tend to look quite fondly to Symphony of the Night as more or less the benchmark for the genre.

"This game is a love letter to all Castlevania fans and all things like it. I have been dying for a new game like this and i really cannot get enough of this game. You will see some negative reviews about the game and honestly they are complaining to just complain. For instance i read someone hated the combat being locked to a single strike motion being the only way to attack. No, that is not Recommended. think of all the fighting games in the world, now put those up, down, left, light attack combos to make your weapon do something good for certain weapons. In all honesty i am really excited for this game to have been made and so are many others. This brings me great hope for the Metroidvania style games future. The exploration is amazing, the weapon variety is amazing. i have 100% demons and map done and i only have about 30% of the weapons and like 23% of items. that should say something about how indepth the game goes. There is always something to do in this game even after you beat it. Also 13 free DLC's in the future. FUCK yeah sign me up for that. \n\nI do have to say i wish you could customise your characters outfit with armors obtained in the game but i kinda get why they didnt want that. now there are a few chest pieces that change your look but they are not that good in terms of defence and stats But fashion souls right? i am kidding. The only issue i have with this game in all its glory is that the spells you get you only use like 3 of each type in the whole game because the others have no reason to be used, but thats just me personally. i find that i didnt use my direction shards almost ever unless to get past a spot i needed to use it on. other than that id probably pay my soul for IGA to make another game like this in this style for many more years to come. Iga please never stop being the legend you are if your ever read this. Seriously i love your work.",Recommended

It is simply good and if people remove their nostalgia glasses, they would understand that it's not a classic or a keeper. The gameplay is stuck in the same time as SotN, your character feels clunky and sluggish. The balance is broken. I oneshotted 3-5 bosses in quick succession with the Chain Blade spell which you can get 2 hours in, and after them the bosses stopped getting damaged by it whatsoever. \nIt's an overpriced game.",Not Recommended

"A fantastic new entry into the Metroidvania genre by one of the original creators himself. Bloodstained is basically like SoTN but better in almost every single way, and I say that as someone who lists SoTN among my favorite games of all time. I'd say the music and sound design in general in this game isn't quite up to snuff with Castlevania in general, but it's not bad by any means. It's just not quite as memorable as Castlevania. The gameplay though is great and it feels just like SoTN for the most part. You get a variety of weapons such as swords, greatswords, axes, maces, whips and even guns to use. You also absorb shards in a system much like Aria and Dawn of Sorrow to gain new abilities to use in combat. There are familiars, active abilities, aimed abilities, passive abilities, etc. The game also has a crafting system, numerous side quests, and a lot of great bosses & great environments to explore. If you enjoyed SoTN, this will absolutely be up your alley. It doesn't innovate much, but everything here is very solid so I don't mind at all.",Recommended

When you hit the sweet spot of just exploring the castle and rooting out secrets, grooving to the music and having a great time, it all just clicks - this all is simply fun.\n\nI would recommend this absolutely, and completely. If you're on the fence, then just go for it, dive in, and remember to thank Konami; they messed up so terribly, that they enabled something that will go down in gaming history to be made.",Recommended
"Just Amazing!!! I don't usually play these ""metroidvanias"" to completion, but this will be the exception. This game is just so much fun. Just do yourself a favor and buy the game.

"Thankfully IGA didn't gave up on Igavanias when Konami fired him, and here's the result of that. Forget about Lord of Shadows, THIS is Castlevania reborn. It takes elements from all the previous series, you can see great similarities between the Shard systems and the glyphs from Order of Ecclesia, or the souls from the Souls series. The multitude of different scenarios and challenging bosses are back too, with the always excellent soundtrack composed by Michiru Yamane.\n\nAt first I was skeptical about the choice for using 3D graphics on a Igavania 2.5D, but the end product has impressed me. The choice of shaders and lightning, and the play with perspective have been all well done.\n\nBloodstained is a tale of success from a Kickstarter game, proving that not all promises will be Mighty No. 9, some of them are delivered as good as we expect.",Recommended
"For me its closer to AoS than to SotN.\n\nGameplay is a solid metroidvania, but has quite a bit of bugs. I clipped through the flour and ended up behind a boss that couldn't turn around, so it was pretty much a ""smash attack button"" situation.\nMusic was good, not at the level of SotN, but that is asking too much. Has two awesome tracks, and the rest are between good and pretty good.\nAesthetics, I like them quite a bit, and the customization of the MC was nice.\nPlot, game is pretty weak here, but really I didn't expect it to be good anyway. Characters are bland and void of personality.\n\nPretty much a good game, bugs will be fixed at some point and you will have a solid metroidvania.\nAs a bonus track, the best/worst review I read was something along the lines of ""A re-skinned castlevania"", I don't know what they expect or wanted, but I would pay for a castlevania rehash at least once a year.",Recommended

"[b]TLDR: Great game. Very nice castle. Some Castlevania-esque corniness and jank that you either love or hate. Getting free content down the road. Easy sell if you're a longtime Iga fan, perhaps wait for a small sale if you're not.[/b]\n\n\nLong and Rambly:\nThe game's fantastic. Bloodstained's castle is huge and riddled with creativity. The writing and voice acting can feel a little cheesy at times, but any long-time Castlevania fan will probably find this more endearing than negative. The combat is extremely tight and responsive, with every weapon type being completely viable with overall good balance and very minor exceptions (daggers and greatswords pale a little in comparison to the other weapon types, spears have issues hitting some short enemies). The difficulty curve is for the most part very fair. All are extremely unique from one another and mostly very fun (though a few can just feel like a nuisance until you get their patterns down).\n\nThere's plenty of sidequests and item hunts to grind for stronger gear if you're into that kind of stuff. If you aren't it's fine too, the weapons you find for exploring and normal progression are more than serviceable. These are alright, nothing particularly emotional or interesting, but it's a nice little side activity if you want it.\n\nI will say that a lot of what this game has in it might feel annoying or janky to anyone who isn't interested in this from a Castlevania background. If that's the case, I might recommend waiting for a sale. But those who are longtime fans of Iga's work , it's an easy sell. Especially with an apparent 13 free DLC's coming later down the road. (playable zangetsu when)\n\nMusically I have no real complaints. The soundtrack is a bit meh at first but about a third of the way through it's mostly great. The game's sounds are also very good and sound appropriate for everything they get applied to.\n\nVisually it can be a bit of a mixed bag, The models all look quite nice and suit the enemies they're made for, but there are a few standout creatures with very janky animations. And frankly, some of Miriam's own animations aren't that great.\n\nAt the time of writing, there are some annoying glitches and performance issues in the game, including a pause menu softlock that requires you to restart the application. There's also one boss in particular late game that caused massive frame drops until I demolished my settings and I frankly have no idea why since it didn't really appear all that visually intense or impressive.",Recommended

There's a bit of aesthetic jank to contend with (rough character animations, Miriam's repetitive barks), but the gameplay and sense of exploration are top notch.",Recommended

"Overall Score - 10/10\nGameplay - 10/10\nStory - 10/10\nSound - 10/10\nVisuals - 10/10\n\nAs a Koji Igarashi fanboy, one could expect me to give this a perfect score, but I was actually worried prior to release that this would be over-hyped and my five year wait would be met with disappointment.  I was proved VERY wrong.  This is an absolutely incredible game from start to finish, and I even enjoyed playing it another two times through.  With all of the gear variations, game modes/difficulties, and promise of more free playable characters to be added to the game, there is much to be done in the game and I stand behind the price tag.  I admit there is a title or two that could compete with this for a lower price, but with the time spent on this title and the amount of content we have and are going to get is worthy of the $40 tag.  Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night absolutely crushes it and for me it is game of the year.  If you are a fan of the Metroidvania genre, then you will have a great time with this title.\n\n\nGameplay 10/10\nBloodstained: Ritual of the Night is a specific type of Action-Platformer known as a Metroidvania, the combination of Metroid and Castlevania mechanics.  You have handfuls of weapons to try out, many with different attack types to play through the game in different ways.  You have magic spells in the game, some of these spells are attacks, while others are player stat buffs.  The game features an attribute system similar to older RPGs.  You'll spend a majority of the game platforming through the world of monsters and demons.  In Bloodstained, the world is built around a castle which is a large puzzle in it's own way.  Some areas of the castle have a few different ways to access them, and you may find after discussion that you and somebody else took entirely different paths on your way to complete the game.  Currently, the game has three different endings to achieve, all based on progress throughout the castle.  As for extra modes, there is a Speed Run Mode and a Boss Rush Mode.  Currently, there is only one playable character, but they have promised there will be two more released for free as well as an extra mode called Chaos Mode and a Rougelike Mode.  Gameplay for this is phenomenal and the length of time you can put into it is great.\n\nStory 10/10\nAfter playing all of the Castlevania Metroidvanias, the hardest thing for me was adopting a new story from Koji Igarashi.  Bloodstained from afar copies a lot of the elements present in the Castlevania series in a positive way.  There are fair shares of demons, monsters, heroes and villains.  You will be expected to traverse through a castle filled with them in it.  To be honest, I was blown away by the story here.  The goals of many seem to come together to solve a problem that is not just their own, but the problem that faces the entire world.  There are three different endings like featured in previous Castlevania titles.  After completing the Recommended ending, I am very excited to see this story move forward on its own.  Of course, if story is not your main focus I would guarantee you would enjoy this title even skipping all of the story dialogue and cutscenes.\n\nSound 10/10\nWhere do I begin here?  Sound effects are top notch and even some references to be made towards Koji Igarashi's previous works as well as references to one of his favorite manga, Jojo's Bizarre Adventure.  In series like this, the music is where it truly shines.  For me, it was very difficult accepting that I would not hear the throwback songs of Castlevania.  The songs featured in Bloodstained do not hold back at all.  Excellent work was done featuring a song for each area as well as each boss fight.  If you are a fan of previous titles, or just love yourself a good video game soundtrack, Bloodstained will not disappoint you.\n\nVisuals 10/10\nBloodstained features what some refer to as a 2.5D Platformer, which is a game which usually features Side-Scroller Movement in a 3D environment.  In Bloodstained, this is incredibly done.  I've played a handful of game like this, some just feature 3D environments, while others have you interact with objects drawn in the background.  This does not do it too much, but it does feature the latter of the options.  That aside the artwork has an animated look to it that stays Recommended to Castlevania artwork, while still featuring its own art (not some crude joke about the backer portraits).  The art allows a truly immersive experience to be had inside the world of Bloodstained.",Recommended

It's Castlevania: Symphony Of The Night with the quality of life improvements you would expect from a modern game. Buy it.,Recommended
A wonderful homage to the SOTN and the Igavania games that followed. While some elements aren't quite as iconic and memorable (due to the voice acting being TOO competent and blah rather than all out cheese and the music not being as catchy) - the gameplay makes up for it and the sheer variety of weapon and shard choices. Although let's be real - everyone is going to be hearing ARISE MYSELF AND MY SHADOW!,Recommended

"Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night is close to perfect for fans of metroidvania games. Huge variety of enemies and each with their own unique ability the player can obtain.

"It's basically Castlevania:SotN in all but name. Exact same sort of gameplay, some extra mechanics added in, same sort of exploration and quest resolution. Get stuck? Probably time to look at your map and find the one square you haven't been to yet. It's nice to finally get another one of these games by Koji Igarashi to play on something that isn't a handheld system.",Recommended
Good game.,Recommended
"I've been waiting so long for a proper IGAvania, and since we never got to see him finish his 1999 Demon War story in Castlevania before getting sacked from Konami, I wasn't sure if we would ever see one. But then came along this game on a wingéd steed wielding a sabre and a chalice, and came to save the day.\n\nThis game is really great. Though at the time of writing this the PC version is badly in need of a patch. But I'm sure when it is patched it'll live up to become the successor to Castlevania the world needed.",Recommended

Excellent game. Worthy successor to the old Castlevania series,Recommended
"I had originally heard about this game years ago, in a kickstarter. Having played and loved all Igavania in my early childhood and even late teens, I've been yearning a similar experience for what felt like decades, and I often found myself thinking back to the times of Dawn of Sorrow, my favourite Castlevania to this date, wishing there was an experience comparable to the joy it brought me.\n\nI can't say my vision isn't blurred by nostalgia, but I can safely say that this is the closest I've ever gotten to being able to relive that joy.\n\nIt feels like playing Castlevania again. From starting up the game, going through the first area, to defeating the first boss, all the way to the end, I've never played a game quite as similar to the old Igavania's I've grown up with as Bloodstained.",Recommended
"A fantastic return to form for the Metroidvania genre and a triumphant return for Koji Igarashi.\n\nTight controls, lots of gear and shards. Cosmetic customization to be had with accessories, outfits, and hairstyles.\n\nBetween this and Bloodstained: Curse of the Moon, Castlevania's spirit may return in a new IP.",Recommended
"Igavania's triumphant return to form. I was a bit disappointed when they chose to go 3D but it is in fact used to good effect in the game, so objection withdrawn - go kill some demons and put on a silly looking outfit to max LCK!",Recommended
Awesome game,Recommended
"I'll admit that I'm biased because I backed the game, but it is great if you like the metroidvania-style Castlevania games. Otherwise just a good game. There's nothing especially groundbreaking in it (at launch, though I'm not expecting anything mindblowing from the free DLCs that will come out), and the game is certainly not perfect (the last few areas in particular feel far too small to me), but I don't regret any of the $360 I backed. While I know not everyone will like the game, I do think most people would enjoy it.",Recommended
This is the best IGA game,Recommended
It's exactly as all other IGAvanias,Recommended
"Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night is as good as it can get when it comes to a modern Castlevania.\n\nThe things I liked about it:\n- The gameplay is super fluid with lots of different skills, movesets and individualisation\n- The soundtrack is awesome and very fitting, though it does sound familiar sometimes.\n- The art direction is on point, well designed map and enemies, both with lots of different themes.\n- You can also cook for stat buffs, craft better items and grow your own materials.\n- Multiple endings with a NG+ option.\n- The story and characters are maybe not the deepest, but they aren't bad either.\n- Free DLCs after release.\n- Fair pricing of the base game\n\nThe things that could be improved on:\n- Had about four crashes, since I try to safe as often as possible, it was at max. a 10 minutes time loss? But yeah, since there's no autosave I hope they fix that asap.\n- Game progression! You can reach the most basic ending without much trouble, but there are some major progression points where I got stuck because I didn't know what to do or how I could pass that obstacle. On one hand it was a really cool experience that the game did not take my by my hand and let me explore on my own (more or less), but on the other hand it got a little frustrating at the mentioned points where I was stuck. It's partly my fault though since I guess I didn't read stuff properly or did not pay enough attention to details, but some of them were just too abstract for my taste.\n- You can only grow a small set of things. Would be nice if you could plant more to reduce farming mobs for materials.\n- Difficulty curve too steep in the last third of the game.\n- Not the best graphics in terms of high resolution for example. Quality differs from area to area.\n- The one DLC that has been released so far is a bit too expensive in my opinion.\n- Very basic sidequests.\n\nI was one of the people who were sceptical about Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night before it was released since it looked like it was missing something. But all my doubts have been washed away the moment I started playing it.\nIt may not be perfect, it may not be a game for everyone, but the things that it wanted to do right have been done right, so congratulations for the success! Personally, I had a great time with it and hope that this genre will experience a renaissance from now on since there's a lot of potential!",Recommended
"I've been very excited about this game ever since the Bloodstained kickstarter was announced, and the wait was worth it. This is a great action-exploration Castlevania game in all but name. I love almost every aspect of it, do enjoy the references a lot, and the music is SO GOOD. Thank you very much, IGA-sama and everyone who helped make this game happen.  I hope we will get more Bloodstained titles in the future.",Recommended

"Although i have beaten this game, i pretty much barely enjoyed a single moment.\nThis game is very weak comparing to any of 3DS era Castlevanias in terms of mechanics, and - which is most important - challenge.\nBloodstained bosses are super weak, boring.\nUnreal Engine and colorful backgrounds dont save this game\n\nI advise you to better go play Portrait of Ruin and Order of Eclessia",Not Recommended
Really fun game. Play it on hard.,Recommended
Great game!  Sated my need for Castlevania.,Recommended
Absolutely love this game. Only reason i was able to put it down at all is i have a family i have to feed.\nSo much metroidvania feels. \nPretty decent looking.

"if you liked SOTN or any of the GBA/DS Castlevania games buy this IMMEDIATELY. it's a masterpiece of design and presentation, but above all, it just FEELS right. there's no way to convey what I mean in words. the movement, the feedback when you hit an enemy, the flash of damage numbers. it's beautiful and incredibly satisfying. stop thinking about it and hit the buy button. it's already amazing, I can only imagine just how much more amazing it's gonna get.",Recommended
Hits the spot!,Recommended
"A great continuation of the Castlevania series, but with many bugs and rough edges.  There are many spells, familiars, and your own character to level up.  While this leads to there being plenty of gameplay choices, some of the spells might be a little too powerful (I beat the back half of the game easily).\n\n8/10",Recommended

Not all of these toys are created equal and it can be easy to break the game if you choose to do so, though perhaps the same could be said of other classics like Final Fantasy VI. And with all the (FREE) bonus modes on the way, this is a bloody-good adventure you'll want to sink your teeth into more than once.\n\nWell worth the wait overall, and no better proof that the Metroidvania genre is far from dead.

"Glitches here and there. Otherwise, very solid game play with a 7/10 story. It feels predictable and cliche at times. David Hayter is a voice actor for a certain character and he has the raspy voice of ""Raiden, squeeze my hog"" from MGS. If you like Metroidvania's it doesn't get much better then this. I have 98.8% map completion at 16hrs so it's a little on the short side. Maybe wait for a Steam sale in 6 months for it to be 20 unless you want to speedrun the game. It has some cool tech and has a ton more glitches I would think.",Recommended
"As a fan of the original castlevania SOTN game, I can defenitely recommend this game.\nFor those who are familiar, I do give the forewarning that this game does borrow a LOT of the various themes, but I can honestly say even the things that they did borrow, they changed enough that I never thought I was just replaying SOTN.  Put simply, if you liked SOTN, you will enjoy playing this.\n\nAlso, (as seen in trailer) for those wondering: yes, the ""invert"" ability is just as fun as it looks in the trailer. \n\nas for the usual others:\n\nMusic: is pretty decent. It's nothing I would see ""getting awards for"" but it is by no means bad in any way, either. It is functional, sounds good and defenitely does it's job.\n\nControls: The main controls you play with, keyboard and mouse or controller works perfectly fine, and I very rarely had any issues.  If you want to try to ""master"" the techniques (think combo's in any fighting game) a controller will defenitely help, but the only technique that truly matters is very easily done, even with keyboard.\n\nGameplay: Enemies are varied, and while there are some abilities that are defenitely way better then others, there's plenty to choose from, and a lot of them are really satisfying, especially when it's an ability straight from an enemy.  Boss mechanics aren't anything to great to talk about, it's mostly ""try to learn patterns and not get hit"" but the patterns are fun to learn.\n\nStory: The story is the kind that you will get just as much back as you put into it. The base story that you will run into just playing through, defenitely serves it's purpose well and while it may leave some questions, if your not that into it, it won't stand in the way to much, especially with the ability to skip almost anything even cutscene like.  For those looking for a deeper story though, it is most defenitely there. You can tell they did some defenite worldbuilding through various lore, descriptions and items to find.  I will say it never goes super in depth, but honestly that was fine.\n\nOverall: 9/10.  If you like castlevania/metroidvania games, this is a defenite mustbuy. If your not sure, it's still a defenite solid game to pick up.",Recommended

"First of all let me say that I may be a bit biased as a big Castlevania fan. Until now, the Castlevania series has just sat on a dusty shelf, but now I can safely say: Castlevania is back with a new face. Knights in armor, werewolves, succubi, ghosts and more. Konami really looks bad for dropping the ball. Ominous settings with fantastic music that really sell the game can be found throughout. New additions to the combat system like swapping presets, are a welcome modernization. All of the monster designs and settings are well done and give me nostalgia for a dead franchise.\nMetroidvania has always been one of my favorite genres. I really enjoy this game.",Recommended

The challenge curve on normal difficulty feels fair with some well thought out ups and downs in the difficulty curve, and by the end as I had done a lot of side questing I was powerful enough to destroy almost any enemy by simply looking in their direction, which felt like a nice reward for the effort.\n\nThere were some bugs, but the game is being updated often enough that I don't believe them to be a detriment to the game and I expect most of them to be gone in a short while.\n\nOverall a strong recommendation, Bloodstained: Ritual of The Night stands tall among its peers.",Recommended

"This review will be written for two people in mind. A metroidvania fan that has not yet bought this game, and someone that has never played a metroidvania game.\n\nFOR METROIDVANIA FANS:\nIf you are a fan of the DS Castlevania games like myself, you've probably already bought this game. If you haven't, know that this game takes the very best elements from the SOTN-style Castlevania games and has put them in one massive game. There are some small things I miss, like the dedicated button for weapon effects (Replaced by simple button combos), but this game makes up for it with one of the more varied spell libraries I've seen in a Castlevania game, borrowing heavily from Dawn of Sorrow's fantastic soul mechanic, the ability to finally change your physical appearance (Hair styles, clothing colors, etc.), and great replayability with three difficulty levels, boss rushes, and a speed run mode.\n\nThis game has a much higher skill ceiling than every Castlevania before it, in my opinion. There are some very quirky and niche spells in this game that compel you to experiment and find what works best for you. If you are like me and have played thousands of hours on the DS games, it's amazing how similar they made the controls, but there are still small changes that you will need to adjust to (Especially directional spells, which are very welcome after getting adjusted to them). They changed how many of the weapons work, and for the better. I found myself using many different types of weapons throughout my time with the game, which I haven't done since Order of Ecclesia. If you are very experienced like I am, my only complaint is that the bosses are far too easy after you get the double jump.\n\nTo keep this brief I will say two more positive things, one is the secrets. I cannot put into words how absurdly amazing some of the secrets are in this game. I will not spoil much, but the most memorable secret area, not counting the numerous secret/optional bosses, is essentially a secret mini-zone. Additionally, they made it far more interesting to find secret areas and you need a combination of being skilled, observant, and hungry for map completion from the start if you want to reap the benefits while they are still viable.\n\nThe last and best thing about this game is that daddy-Iga has put together a very attentive team of people that seem to be working diligently to iron out all the bugs, which I will admit are the biggest point of contention for me. You WILL experience bugs in this game (Some pretty frustrating, like opening book shelves crashing your game), but I am willing to overlook this because the dev team is so open with the players about working to fix this game.\n\nIF YOU'VE NEVER PLAYED A METROIDVANIA:\nIf I had to sum up what this genre is like in one word, I would say, ""Satisfying."" Daddy-Iga has been fine-tuning this genre for years. My first, and enduring, impression is of this genre is that everything is designed to feel good. The act of simply moving your character feels good (And only gets far more fun as you get more abilities), getting more powerful feels good too, so does discovering the many secrets in this game. Literally everything is designed to provide an immensely satisfying  experience thanks to how incentives work in this game. Even something mundane like killing low-level enemies is always rewarding because of how intelligently thought-out the shard system is in this game. You always have something to gain.\n\nTo keep this concise I will simply state my favorite thing about this game, which is the control of your character. The degree of control you have is so fine, and the weapons and spells you have so robust, that no one player will play the same. As you get better you can find ways to make yourself attack more efficiently with your weapon by experimenting with the game mechanics, and you are confident that every mistake you make is because you have room to improve. The skill ceiling is very high in this game, and that is what always drives me to play it, because even after playing other games of this type for 1000 hours I can still improve.\nIf you like the sound of everything I've said above, the only Recommended reason you have to delay buying this game is to wait out until they iron out all the bugs, which are being handled by a very diligent and responsive dev team. If the game wasn't enough, the developers for this game truly care about their customers, and that is something I love more than I can put into words.\n\nThis game gets an obvious recommendation from me. My love for Castlevania goes beyond what I've written here, as these games never ever fail to not be dangerously engaging for me. If you have never played a Castlevania game, you owe it to yourself to try this game.",Recommended

I wrote an in depth review of this just before this and steam deleted it.  Short and sweet.  Worth your 40 bucks if you even passingly like Metroidvania games.,Recommended
"A nice IGAvania. nothing new or groundbreaking, but ticks all the right boxes for a fun game.",Recommended
This is a very good game even if it is my first game of this genre I have played through the entire game and have defeated all the bosses,Recommended
Everything I had hoped it would be. Mighty #9 this is not.,Recommended
This feels just right. It's reminiscent of SotN without being the same. I'm really enjoying this game. I'm almost done with my first play through. I can't wait to play it again. I like the goofy novelty items too!,Recommended
If you loved Castlevania: SOTN you will definitely love this.,Recommended

"First playthrough: 16.8 hrs\n\nIf you like Hollow Knight, Dust: An Elysian Tail or Ori and the Blind Forest you'll love this game. I've never played any old school metroidvania titles but this is up there with the best of them.\n\nPros- \n+Obscene amount of loot, chests and gear to find and sort through\n+The combat is satisfying with a bunch of gear, weapons and spells available for you to choose from to suit who you're messing up\n+The dialogue system is great with full English and Japanese voice acting. I didn't like the English voices so used Japanese though and found it was better\n+Progression is as satisfying as you'd expect from any metroidvania, finding health boosts, mp boosts and other items to pad your stats is a blast\n+The inventory management, meal, gear & shards management is fun to mess around with as you explore the world\n+Characters give you quests alongside your main quest with rewards (mostly cash) which makes for fun little side objectives that are never a pain (although I didn't complete most of them)\n+The OST is amazing, I love it \n+13 free DLCs to come during the games life span! It made a bunch on kickstarter so I guess that's why, meeting stretch goals and such\n+The platforming reminds me of hollow knight and is so tight and fluid (though not nearly as hard at times) \n+The art on display in conjunction with the implementation of the 2.5d style makes the game/areas look so beautiful! Especially when the world is rotating around you like going up towers etc\n+You'd expect the story to be your run of the mill, trash fantasy rpg setting but I actually really enjoyed it! I wanna learn more of this world/experience more titles in this universe\n\nCons-\n-The very late/end game kinda... sucks? The bosses are fun and conceptually the journey is cool as fuck, just in practice finding the items and areas and everything required for the Recommended ending just isn't fun. It really takes away from what would otherwise be a perfect game \n\n 4/5\n★★★★✰",Recommended
great game from the creators of the old metroidvanias such as SOTN. very much in the spirit of the old games and could honestly just be called castlevania: ritual of the night,Recommended
"Recommended Metroidvania game, if you have played any of the gba or DS Castlevania's this is a game very similar to those.\n\nfirst game in a long time I took the time to get all the trophies. \n\n",Recommended
This game feels like peak Castevania Symphony of the Night. It is definately worth picking up,Recommended
It's like having amnesia and being able to experience Symphony of the Night with fresh eyes again,Recommended
I was a backer for their kickstarter and it did not dissapoint.,Recommended
"This game is everything I wanted it to be. While I'm playing it, I tend to forget that I'm not playing Castlevania. It feels like a perfect mix of Symphony of the Night, with its level/area design, and Aria/Dawn of Sorrow with the Shard system to acquire new abilities from enemies. Also, the music is fantastic. My only gripe with it is that I've experienced more soft-locks than I'd like, requiring me to force-quit the game. If I've forgotten to save recently, that's a problem. I still love the game, though, and wholeheartedly recommend it.",Recommended
"Honestly, every review reads pretty much the same.\n\nThis game is pretty much a beefy meat and cheese Hungry Man's dinner version of Symphony of the Night.\n\nGameplay is fun, it looks good and the music isn't bad.\n\nSome areas are annoying and it can be slightly cryptic.\n\n8/10",Recommended
"Just got a haircut, might whip some chisels at a slot machine later idk",Recommended
"Best ""metroidvania"" game EVER. this will now be my yearly replay of this type of game. Goodbye SOTN it was a sweet 20+ years.",Recommended
"It's a great game, i definitely recommend this.",Recommended
"Not disappointed , another great game from IGA again",Recommended
"Unpolished as hell in certain places (good luck trying to do no damage runs on certain bosses) but overall made from the same glue as Symphony of the Night.\n\nIt's a 7/10 that's absolutely worth playing, would be an 8-9 if they fixed the polish issues and smoothed out the artstyle. Maybe in the sequel, eh?",Recommended
I'm just here to leave a positive review because this game absolutely deserves it.\n\nHaven't had this much fun in a while.,Recommended
"After the long wait from the kickstarter I was not disappointed.\nEverything about the gameplay just feels right. There are familiar mechanics and abilites to metroidvainias I've come to expect but there were a few surprises as well. The game also does a decent job of guiding your play if your having trouble, via npc dialogue (assuming you don't skip it). All in all, if your a fan of Metroidvainias and in particular if your were looking for the spiritual successor to SOTN, this is what your looking for.",Recommended
"I am a Kickstarter backer, and I'm glad I was one. If you enjoy Castlevania games such as Symphony of the Night, Dawn of Sorrow, or Portrait of Ruin, then I highly recommend this game. As of the time of writing this review, there are still a few bugs being worked on and a LOT of DLC to be released. Some parts could use a little more polish, but overall, it's a very fun game that I enjoy, and have already beaten twice.",Recommended

"**No Spoilers review**\n\nJust completed my first playthrough without any guides and got to 100% map completion, this is absolutely what gaming needs to go back to. No gambling, no microtransaction crap, and definitely no Konami here #Fuckonami\n\nGameplay: 7/10\nThe game is meant to replicate Castlavania without actually being Castlevania and i believe it achieves this well. Theres a tonne of weapons and things to try out and explore, my only complaints is that the game felt a bit too easy for me, Bosses were too predictable and didnt survive long enough in many cases for you to witness their full move set. Some weapon sets were clearly overpowered, and some very underpowered, meaning you rarely switch weapon types, Bloodstained needs a long look about how they balance weapons. Weapons which take a great deal of effort to get, end up really weak compared to what you have. There is over 150 weapons, but i only used 8 because when and where you pickup these weapons, needs to be better balanced. Barely anything was an upgrade for me, which means i couldnt really enjoy most of the weapons in the game due to their poor placement in progression. I worry the game may feel a bit short for other users especially if you rush. The Recommended final boss died for me in 20 seconds, again balance is just not there.\n\nSound and Music: 7/10\n""OOooooooo!"" The music is fantastic all the way through, whilst some of the voice acting is a bit poor the majority of the sound is great. It can sometimes be let down by sounds which are obviously of a lower inconsistant quality, for example the Bats sound like a 8bit sound.\n\nControls: 9/10\nI dont agree with the complaints that people cant move and attack, its never been a thing in Castlevania games and to do so would mean you constantly get hit by enemies youre attacking, the controls make sense and represent how these games play. Some of the weapon techniques are too hard to discover in my opinion, so i drop 1 point there.\n\nGraphics: 5/10\nAverage but acceptable. It is a mixed bag, some zones of the game look beautiful while some look super cheap. Some of the enemies look good and some look like 'blobs' a college students first 3d model ever. Whilst the graphics aren't bad, theyre not great either, again the issue here is Consistancy, each part of the game looks like it was done by a different crew with different ideas and styles, leading some places to look a bit cartoony.\n\n**OVERALL SCORE:  7/10**\n\nSymphony of the Night is still the better game, but Ritual of the Night isnt too far behind and i honestly hope that Koji Igarashi (the creator) uses the money he gets from the sales of this game, to make another game, this time with a much higher budget and a lot more content. BUT, for the lowered price i paid of £30 ($35), i feel like i definitely am getting my moneysworth here.",Recommended

Good game. The doomsayers were hella wrong.,Recommended
"7/10\nOverall, Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night is an excellent game with solid gameplay, gorgeous enemy design, weapon design and character design. \nIt falls down somewhat in its armour designs with numerous weak visual options from scarves and headpieces and a scant 2 armour looks. It is an absolutely baffling choice given the inclusion of the barber. I'd have happily taken the default hair the whole time for different armour outfits and transmogrification for equipped items.\nThe balance of the various weapon types is a cause for misery\nThe biggest flaw for me has to be the middling map design. It simply lacks the character of a Castlevania in this respect. There are different areas and a few breakable walls, but there's rarely an 'aha' and there was no big reveal regarding the nature of the castle itself. The big thing missing here is the castle itself as a character with real mechanisms and secrets. I hope the inevitable sequel addresses this gripe.\nLastly, Normal difficulty is far too easy and having to finish it on normal to unlock hard and nightmare detracts from the enjoyment and challenge when you play those game modes, since one is robbed of that challenging first play of discovery.",Recommended

"Miriam waited. The lights above her blinked and sparked out of the air. There were demons in the castle. She didn't see them, but had expected them now for years.

When she was young she watched the ships and she said to Alfred ""I want to be on the ships Mr!"" Alfred said ""No! You will BE KILL BY DEMONS!""\nThere was a time when she believed him.

"Instant classic, easily one of the best Metroidvania games I've ever played. Smooth and responsive controls, no instant-death traps, challenging without being frustrating, huge map to explore and tons of secrets to find and opportunities for character advancement. It can be a little tricky figuring out where to go in order to use your latest power to open a new part of the castle, and the ""multiple endings"" I've seen so far leave something to be desired, but these are small nitpicks.

"Really good metroidvania, I recommend starting on the Hard difficulty using the name ""Nightmare"" when creating a new game. You'll need to be a little patient, maybe grind quite a bit to make it out of the first area, but it will be worth it in the end as the game will stay challenging and engaging all the way up to the end game when you start finding the REALLY broken spells. Those broken spells become much more satisfying after enduring the hard mode playthrough, so even when the challenge ends, the fun doesn't. \n\nSave often, the PC release is still buggy so you may encounter a few crashes.",Recommended
Real good if you wanna find cool secrets and have cool weapons!,Recommended
"really fun, tight old school castlevania gameplay and atmosphere, and stands up there with symphony of the night and the all the GBA/DS iga titles. 22 hours in and i'm nearing the end, and it's been fun the whole way, with plenty of exploring and side quests still left to do.",Recommended
"Absolutely incredible. I haven't been super into games as of late, finding it difficult to get into one. This game has reignited my love of games. I don't want to get too into it, because although I have defeated the ""final boss"" and received an ending, it is for sure the worst one possible. But I'm going back in.\n\n**EDIT**\n\nI'm editing this because this game has become one of my favorite of all time. If you like Castlevania, Metroidvanias, or just side-scrolling action games in general, you owe it to yourself to get this game. I maxed everything out and got every achievement here on Steam, loved every minute so much I bought the physical copy on PS4 so that I could get the platinum trophy and support Koji.\n\nDoes the game have issues? Sure. It's clearly a lower budget title so there are some things that they did to cut corners which you'll notice if you've got a good eye and play the game enough. There are some obvious things, though, like repeating dialogue, that should get annoying but don't for some reason. There are some minor technical glitches, and in the 55 hours I've played so far I crashed I think once. But I really don't care because the gameplay loop is so freaking satisfying. I've done the complete archive twice now and I would do it again it was so satisfying watching it fill up.\n\nI really can't sing the praises of this game enough. I wish I could thank Koji in person for making me fall in love with video games again and reminding me what's possible.\n\nSeriously, get this game.",Recommended
If you like Symphony of the Night you'll like this.,Recommended
"If you enjoyed playing any of Koji Igarashi's Castlevania games, buy this game. Speaking as someone who has wiled away many hours playing Symphony of the Night, this game isn't just like SotN, It is more. It's like (nearly) every Iga Castlevania out there. Mind bogglingly-huge map (SotN), collecting enemy abilities (the "" -- of Sorrow"" games), villagers giving side quests (Order of Ecclesia); all we need is multiplayer (Harmony of Despair) and that would be it, all of Iga's Castlevania titles rolled into one massive not-Castlevania game. It's brilliant.",Recommended
"Disclosure: I Backed this game on Kickstarter.\nI backed this game because of the passion I saw within Iga. The soulful and theatrical nature of his original kickstarter video captured my heart.\n\nThis game successfully can scratch that 'Good Ol' Castlevania' itch that you might have. \nWithin its game play, it stays Recommended to the Metroidvania foundation but it has many very special twists and turns within it that will have players coming back especially with even more content to come in the future.\n\nI wont claim it is a perfect game, but it is fun in my opinion and I believe that it is worth playing.\n\n\n",Recommended

"Dont believe the system requierments, if you have a potato pc you arent ok.\n\nYou'll have to select the lowest graphical settings, which by itself isnt something bad, but the problem is that unlike other games this one looks really bad on the lowest settings, so it turns into Castlevania but with really bad looking 3D models and cutscenes.\n\nAlso I dont know if this is also because my pc cant run the game properly, but the movement and combat are really slow compared to Castlevania, which could ruin the game for you if you loved how the combat was in those games.",Not Recommended
"Metroidvanias are my favorite type of game currently.  I have thoroughly enjoyed touhou lunar nights, Hollow Knight, and Timespinner.  I have beaten the Path of Pain and Pantheon 4 for Hollow Knight so I am no stranger to highly difficult bosses.  \n\nAfter playing this game for a long time, I will have to say that it isn't ready.  Save your money and buy it later.  The game design is beautiful, the world created is brilliant, the character development is great, however, the highlight of the metroidvania games for me (the bosses) were not finished coding before the release.  I have taken more damage from a boss attempting to dodge away from me than any other damage from a boss.  I have a hard time predicting what they are going to do even after my 15th time playing them.  It took me about 15 tries to beat the Pure Vessel on hollow knight but at least I knew what he was going to do.  Fighting the bosses in this game will leave you befuddled as they are not smooth, some can execute multiple attacks at once showing multiple animations at once, attacks can come without any warning at some times and a ton of warning at others.  Finally the dodging system will often leave you wondering how not to take damage.  The game has extremely high potential and I would highly recommend buying it later, but it is just not ready.",Not Recommended

"After seeing the amazing job that was done on Bloodstained: Curse of the Moon, I was really looking forward to this game. This game perfectly captures the feel of Castlevania: SoTN and other metroidvania games in the same way that Curse of the Moon perfectly captures Castlevania: Dracula's Curse. If you are starving for a new Castlevania game in the metroidvania style, this is exactly it in everything but name. I should probably also mention that the game is beautiful and sounds amazing. However, it isn't perfect. I would have preferred some of the more obtuse castle progression walls could have been left out. The game is by nature going to be very grindy to begin with, but there are some parts that force it even a bit more even if you don't want to 100% every aspect of the game. I've also run into a handful of technical bugs. Miriam fully clips far behind walls at times to the point that I can't imagine that the developers wanted that result. The game always starts on the wrong monitor for me and I have to manually unfullscreen the game and manually move it to the correct monitor. I've also had a crash or two. None of those things are deal breakers for me, but I have read about some people experiencing far worse. I'm hopeful that the bugs get fixed in the near future, but only time will tell.",Recommended

"Okay so I will admit I was tempted to be a backer of the game, but I was turned off of kickstarter backed games by a friend who had been sucked into the Star Citizen nonsense.  I am glad the game came out as good as it did, it does justice to crowd funded games.\nI am not a huge Metroid-Vania player, nor am I the best at platformers like this, but the RPG element of the game and the trinkets of lore and callbacks that even a novice like I can appreciate (I know you O.D.!) kept my interest despite many deaths.  I really love the music and vocals in the game, there is just so much of it that its astounding for an Indie Crowd Funded game.  I am looking forward to any DLC they put out and hoping for other offerings from the team that made this gem.\n\nPros:\n+ Lots of beautiful environments and detailed creatures.  They all seem very well developed and painstakingly crafted into the world and its lore.\n+ Great music and strong vocals.  The Music is wonderful, the title theme alone gives chills.  I also love how all the main characters are fully voiced with a great depth to their dialogue.\n+ The game play is solid and never suffers from a lack of things to do.  There is always somewhere to go back to to use a new ability or effect to further explore.\n+ The RPG elements are fantastic.  While they may seem like window dressing (like making Miriam into your dolled up waifu complete with bunny ears!) I really enjoyed the wide variety of weapon types, spell types, and familiars.  Each has their strengths and weaknesses which are fun to flush out.\n\nCons:\n- Newcomers may feel a bit lost.  I am quite a novice to the Castlevania lore, but people with no experience may wonder about some elements of the game and what part they play.\n- Techniques could use polish.  I had a lot of trouble getting them to come out consistently.  In the end I gave up on them almost entirely, which made me feel like I missed out on a huge portion of the game.

I wish you could have chosen between a girl or a boy protaganist though. I like female mains but she's designed to be a bit too much of a japanese man's school girl fantasy. I was also expecting the weapon attacks to combo into different animations but I'm not too mad about it because it makes it really retain the classic castlevania style. The weapon variety and techniques are great and there are a ton of different weapons. It seems like there are a lot of diffferent shards and spells as well so there's hundreds of ways to customize your character and play style. I'm also so happy about familiars which level up while they're equipped and can further be enchanced by finding more of the same familiar shard. This really is the penultimate castlevania. The biggest problem I have with it is that nightmare mode is just a level 1 run. I was going to wait till nightmare mode to 100% the game but the idea of being locked at level 1 REALLY doesn't appeal to me. Plus, hard mode was not that hard so I was looking forward to playing the game on difficult level, but not handicapped. There should be a nightmare mode seperate from a level locked mode.",Recommended

"The game is pretty great, especially if you've played the previous Igavanias.\n\nBut there's already a million people sucking this game's dick - rightfully so - so what can I add to the conversation that isn't just more of that?\n\nWell, the game is really easy. Like, really, really easy. I've only died to one boss, one time - the samurai guy - and every other boss either died almost instantly or their AI wigged out and they just stood there while I whaled on them. There's three difficulties, and you *have* to play on the easiest one and beat it before you can play on the harder ones, otherwise I would've restarted by now on a higher difficulty, because man... there's just no challenge here. The hardest part of the game so far (just got past the train) has been one bit where I wasn't sure where to go because there was a path that you *had* to sit there and tank damage to get through, and I thought it was telling me I wasn't supposed to go that way, so I wandered for a while and ended up having to look it up. That's it, that's the most difficult part of the game.\n\nI'm not saying it has to be hard as nails, but I'd like to have to at least *see* all the moves a boss has before they die, and ideally I'd have to learn how to avoid their patterns. You know, like a video game?\n\nThe game is still really good, it succeeds at what it set out to do and it does scratch that Igavania itch, and I assume harder difficulties - again, on successive playthroughs only - will be more satisfying.\n\nEDIT: I'm sitting here thinking about what else I can say, and something else occurred to me.\n\nThere's a series of weapons in the game you can only get by acquiring these special coins, like the 8-Bit Coin, and not only do the coins themselves not at all fit within the universe of the game itself, but seemingly neither do the weapons themselves. You can come across one of these coins pretty early on, and all the weapons you can get with it seem to be really overpowered, or at the very least they don't seem to fit into the game's ""normal weapon"" tier list that you normally have access to at this point in the game. I'll probably mess around with them in the harder difficulties just to see what they do, but I'm going out of my way to ignore them in my first playthrough because they really stand out as being just... Kickstarter fanservice nonsense, y'know? I could do without all that.",Recommended

"[POSSIBLE SPOILERS!!!]\n\nSo, I've played the whole game and have gained every achievement so I'm here for to give a review. First things first, this game is made by the same guy that helped make Castlevania: Symphony of the Night (so there is that nostalgia for those that have played that game before) and so obviously there are similarities. While playing the game I was really interested by the story, but also the things I could do through out it. The map is essentially just as big as the map from SotN. There are easter eggs for fans of the Castlevania (unfortunately no wall chicken, as far as I known anyway). There are a ton of side quests as well.\n\nNow onto something bad things about the game. First, glitches. There are glitches in the game, I won't lie and say I've seen them all, but the ones I have - such as opening the menu and your Miriam's head is missing - can cause to have to exist the game to fix it. Second, after beating the game there are secret bosses - that you can fight while during the story, except for one - but once you have beaten them all that's left to do is just mostly collecting the achievements. As I have said before there are a ton of side quests, but they are mostly alike such as, get this item, kill this monster, and make this item, now I'm not saying that I didn't like the quests, but I did get a bit tired of them near the end of the game.\n\nNow the DLC. The DLC adds an extra boss which shows up in the place where you face Gebel, once you've defeated him anyway. The DLC also adds the Sword Whip, which you get from defeating the DLC boss, IGA.\n\nNow I hope my review has helped any reading this, if not I'm sorry, but overall I highly recommend playing this game. I have hope that any problem/glitches that are/were there will be fixed.",Recommended

"beautiful art, so nostalgic, and great game play.  Enjoyed collecting all the shards and weapons and exploring the map.\n\nthe DOWNSIDE of this game is there are few spots where there is a block in progression.  game doesnt explain what to do, and its so random that i had to youtube to figure out how to progress.\ni wont spoil it but a few quest or chat boxes that would hint that those key spots would be great.",Recommended

"Pros:\n\n1. Amazing Graphics\n2. Game play is super responsive.\n3. In depth story line\n4. No bugs AT ALL\n5. $20 less than I would pay for a AAA title (even when it is at full price)\n6. Koji Igarashi (Iga) developed this game. (The creator of Symphony of the Night one of the most influential Castlevania games ever created.)\n7. In depth customization of weaponry and armor\n8. Level Design is amazing.\n9. Monsters are creative and a plenty.\n\nCons:\n\n1. An extremely short game. 9 hours by my record. \n\n\nI think this is the best platformer I have ever played in my lifetime, although the game is way too damned short to entertain the idea of paying $40 for. I really felt a little ripped off.\n\nI bought AOC: Origins, and that shit didn't even work. So, I got a refund and bought this awesome game.\n\nHands down, if you loved Castlevania SoTN, you are going to love this game.\n\nI would recommend this to ANYONE, but especially to the fans of SoTN.\n\nMaybe it is because Iga was in on this, but I feel like the Gamers won a round in this fight against evil money greedy industry destroying assholes that create games just for the DLC at launch and the P2W tactics like EA and Capcom. \n\nThis game is a chalk in our favor. Thank god someone is listening.\n\nFinally a game worth buying, well programmed, and a beautiful game hands down all for $20 less than the broken bug addled AOC: Origins and games like it cost, before DLC at launch of course. :(  \n\n\nAnd to top it off? No DLC. \n\nThis is an honest developer, and a damn good one.\n\nHats fuckin off to Iga and the staff that helped support this title. \n\nI will be back for more if they write it. \n\nI hope they make the next one longer, I was very disappointed by this, and even a little discouraged.",Recommended
Good game. Feels like Castlevania SOTN and Aria of Sorrow (or Dissonance I can't remember) had a child. I wish drops increased in quality with increases in difficulty. Definitely worth the price,Recommended
"Great. Combat can feel uncomfortable to start, at least in my experience, but it gets much better quite quickly.",Recommended
Very well designed.  Reminded me of the good ol' days of Symphony of the Night (even the boss themes sounded similar!).  Looking forward to all the DLC's for this!,Recommended

"I'be been waiting for this game for 6 years. Would I say it was worth the 6 year wait? So far, no. This is a great game, and there are free DLC's coming, but for such a long wait there are still things in this game that feel slightly incomplete, like no multiplayer on launch, and every sprite other than the main character looking like they are from a ps1 game. The game is great despite the slight disappointments. It has every feature you could want from a single player side scrolling Metrovania. Literally everything. The story and cinematics are amazing. For being a $40 game, there is a lot of story content. I would recommend this game to anyone who is already a fan of this genre of game, but I would say symphony of the night is better if you've never played one before. The free DLC could make this game amazing. It could be the closest thing we PC players will get to Castlevania Harmony of Despair. How there hasn't been ANY other game like Castlevania HD, on pc, blows my mind. Most fun I've ever had gaming.",Recommended
"An amazing game that fulfills the metroid-vania style gameplay you would expect from this genre! Captivating music, sounds, and artstyle compliment the game very well! Must-play!!",Recommended
It's a nice remake of  Castlevania: SotN.,Recommended
"Edit: I'm in fucking love with this game. Probably my game of the year!\n\n\nSo far so good!\n\nAside from a few bugs here and there I'm really enjoying the game. The progression system and variety of weapons and skills in game are incredible and keeps it fresh. It truly is the next evolution of Metroidvania.  I especially like the incentive they added to cooking, so it actually serves a purpose and feels worthwhile.  You gain permanent stat boosts once per each unique meal. I also love that you can customize Miriam, even though she's perfect the way she is. It really adds that extra flavor and freedom to the game.\n\n\nGreat job Iga, looking forward to the DLC updates.",Recommended
If you love Castlevania SOTN you will love this game.,Recommended
"Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night is as close to perfect as fans of metroidvania games could hope for. Exploration is absolutely a blast; the enemies are as enjoyable to kill as they are creative, and aspects such as backtracking and grinding are actually fun. This game has enough to keep you hooked for nights on end, and it’s only going to get bigger as time goes on.",Recommended
10/10. A must for Castlevania fans.,Recommended
"\nI actually backed this on Kickstarter years ago and I'm glad I did. It does just about everything right. The exploration was great, combat was solid, music was awesome, they even threw in some ridiculousness like a demon shredding on the guitar that shoots stuff at you. The dev team clearly designed this game to be fun and fun it was. My only complaints are I think the controls could be a little tighter, the controls are menus were actually really bad IMO (if you're using an analog stick and press down and like 5 degrees to the right, it thinks you press right,) and some of the animations were kind of janky in animations. I want to emphasize that I don't think the controls were bad, they were still good, there were just some moments where they don't feel as good as they should be in chaotic moments. Overall, still an awesome game. If you want to play a Castlevania game, this is a must play. Definitely one of the best games of 2019 so far.",Recommended
"If you liked Symphony of the Night, this is better.",Recommended
"Highly Recommended, Best Castlevania game in a long long time.\nIf you like any of the Game boy advanced or symphony of the night style this game is for you.",Recommended
"This is the game I wanted it to be and more. Playing though it on Switch and PC, and I'm finding the weapons offer enough variety to allow me to mix it up and keep it fresh. Totally worth the wait.",Recommended
Pretty good.,Recommended
"It's pretty much one of the classic Castlevania games; If you liked those, you'll love this. Picking up loot from enemies can be a little buggy if you kill them in an awkward position, but other than that it plays great.",Recommended
"great game buy it, its worth",Recommended
"This game is, in my opinion, awesome. It obviously takes inspiration from the castlevania rpg games (SotN, Sorrow, Portait, etc.); however, playing this games shows that it brings plenty of freshness to the table. The controls feel good, the art is awesome, and the music is epic. I would highly recommend this game to anyone that is interested.",Recommended

Best game since OG castlevania... Cant wait for the next one.,Recommended
"This game definitely has the DNA of SotN with subtle changes, just enough to make it different, but still enjoyable. It's understandable why they had to be made, but I really really miss the ability to dual wield weapons. \n\nOverall, it's still enjoyable and deserves some of your time, especially if you liked SotN. Generally, I recommend it mostly for the nostalgia factor, as there are so many other similar games in the genre.",Recommended
awful,Not Recommended
"This game is Symphony of the Night 2.  Plain and simple.  If the idea of a SotN sequel excites you, you won't be disappointed.  The game took a while to get here and experienced some development hiccups, but Igarashi-sama and his team listened, made course corrections, and the result is a masterpiece of the Metroidvania -- ahem -- ""Igavania"" genre.",Recommended
"As a backer of the Kickstarter campaign, it is safe to say that my excitement for this game over the last four years has been overwhelming. I watched as the game developed, was delayed, was featured at numerous conventions, and even enjoyed all the fun little videos that they posted. The fact that this game is finally here is nothing short of exciting for me.\n\nIf you loved Symphony of the Night, Aria of Sorrow, or Aria of Dissonance, do yourself a favor and play this game.\n\nPROS:\nGreat visual quality\nAmazing soundtrack\nIGAvania returns!!\nFun, engaging boss battles\nMultiple difficulty\nNew Game +\n13 free DLC (yes, free)\nLots of stuff to do if you are a completionist.\n\nCONS:\nSome input delay\nOccasionaly audio during dialogue will stop\nGame will sometimes crash or hard lock in a menu\nWords will sometimes not appear in text boxes\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE CONS\nThe team is currently hard at work trying to fix the Switch port, and has stated that they will be working on these issues once the Switch version is where it needs to be.",Recommended
"IGA, the Recommended OG master of Castlevania has finally returned to deliver a game to put Konami and their pachinko machines to shame. If you enjoyed any of the classic Castlevania games since Symphony of the Night, you'll love this. It's Castlevania in all but name.\n\nAs you can see in the trailer, it no longer looks like poop. And Solid Snake is now a samurai guy. That's also kind of cool.",Recommended
"A wonderful example of how crowdfunding should work, and an excellent spiritual-successor/continuation of the Castlevania series... definitely worth checking out!",Recommended
Scratches the Castlevania itch I have had for the past 18 years. Some things aren't to clear when it comes to item use and the running animation could be tightened up to have less gliding. Overall an excellent game.,Recommended
Wonderful castlevania. Haven't enjoyed a game like this since Hollow Knight.,Recommended
"This game combines the good things from past Castlevania games into one (SotN, Aria/Dawn of Sorrow). If you don't mind the weird 3D graphics, you will not be disappointed.\n\nPros\n- A very faithful spiritual successor. Has everything you ever want from a Castlevania game and some more. \n- *** beautiful soundtracks.\n\nCons\n- Cheap looking 3D graphics.\n- Some boss fights are way too easy.\n- Most animated cutscenes feel unfinished (seems like don't have a proper screenplay writer for this game).",Recommended

"Yes, this is probably IGA's best game. That and the fact that Koji Igarashi was the Catlevania producer at Konami for 10+ years (from 2001 to 2010) should fill you with confidence that this is indeed a great MetroidVania game. Just be aware that it's stylistically closer to the NDS games than from SOTN.",Recommended
So good i bought it 2x... after 100% everything on PS4 i decided when the multiplayer DLC is released I want to experience it on steam with friends. 10/10 best game I have played in a long time THANK YOU IGA! Kickstarted this in 2015!,Recommended

A slew of weapons, spells, character color and hair changes, extra bosses, amazing soundtrack, beautiful visuals, and more. You can not go wrong with this game, this is truly a masterpiece everyone should play.",Recommended
"If you are looking for something just like Symphony of the Night, this is what you've been waiting for. Gameplay is very Metroid-vania, and similar to SOTN with some new additions. The story even mirrors that of the original. Honestly, after how long this game has been anticipated, I wish it was more original. It's very tedious, yet rewarding. Definitely a more old-school, hardcore format. I will say it has a lot of stuff to upgrade, craft, and hunt that you can spend hours upon hours achieving. Don't expect much of a story or good dialogue out of this game, though. If you're the target audience for this game, you already know you want it, and you will likely have a good time. Otherwise, you'll probably have some complaints. The dialogue is cheesy as heck...For real. Some stuff was done so lazily. But Even in those ways it's similar to the 1997 classic. Graphics leave something to be desired, even for the style they adopted for this game. I'd have enjoyed something that looked a little better on max settings, or even had they decided to go back to their pixelated roots.\n\nIf you've played SOTN, you will be surprised by just how much of a copy this game seems to be. It was enjoyable and satisfied the cravings I've had since playing that game. However, it doesn't bring enough to the table to likely ever be considered a classic on it's own.",Recommended
Superb 10 out of 10,Recommended
"Bloodstained is an awesome successor to Iga's Castlevania while being its own game. A modern take with old-school mechanics, Bloodstained features a wide variety of weapons to use, demons to kill and ""shards"" or magical abilities to absorb.

"This game is as much Castlevania as you can get on Steam.\nAbout 12 hrs for a completion and about 30 for completing everything so far.\nTher game looks great, it has deep mechanics and feels like Castlevania. \nIt  has got a ton of cool combat abilites, a modern but not inventive crafting system. Good but not great level design and a good ammount of content to explore for your buck.. Fun but not too memorable bossfights but it feels so good in general. \nIt takes parts from Symphony of the NIght and every DS-Castlevania to make an amalgamation of all famous IGAvanias. \nPersonally I would say it resembles Dawn of Sorrow (DS) the most. While I do not think this is the definitive IGAvania game I think it is the best and I cannnot wait for all the DLC to come out. \nBeware of some small crashes so save frequently. I encountered about 5 crashes in 40 hours playtime. \n\nI would give it a 8.5/10 from a gamedesign perspective as it really modernized the IGAvania series. But on the other hand I 10/10 needed that game so bad. I loved the DS Castlevania so much and there was just not replacement until this game cam out. I would recommend to play these games as well.",Recommended
It's good in all of the ways that SotN was good and bad in all of those ways as well. \n\nDefinitely needs a New Game Plus sort of mode where you can continue on while the monsters do increasingly more damage.,Recommended
"If you like Castlevania Symphony of the night, aria of sorrow, dawn of sorrow, this game is made for you.\n",Recommended
Amazing game,Recommended
"Such an amazing game, feels really fluid and the depth of most items and shards allows for a lot of exploration and fun to be had while trying out different things.\n\nReally enjoyable experience.

"[b]Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night is the spiritual successor to Castlevania: Symphony of the Night. It heavily borrows elements from the Metroidvania style of genre with a giant map and tons of backtracking.[/b]\n\n[h1]Soma Cruz 2: Electric Boogaloo[/h1]\n\nSo despite what Koji Igarashi [from here on out referred to as IGA] promised with this game, which was a spiritual successor to SotN, it's hardly that. Maybe in design and the leveing system but that's about as far as it goes. It's actually closer to a Soma Cruz game than anything. Every subsequent Castlevania game made after SotN was always trying to re-create what SotN had delivered and every single one of them fell flat and never lived up to the greatness of SotN. Why?\n\nReason being because SotN was the grand finale to a great action side scroller series that had developed over the course of a decade on the NES and SNES. It had memorable characters, characters you grew up with and references to such, it felt like home.  This just feels like another Soma Cruz grind out game with no purpose.\n\nThis my just be my personal opinion but I hate Soma Cruz and everything he stands for. The entire monster absorption system is a literal abortion of the franchise, this isn't Pokemon, it's Castlevania, I want to kill stuff and move on, not ""collect them all"". \n\nYou spend more time walking in and out of screens trying to farm for monster abilities than you do anything else. This style of game play is a game killer as it bores the audience with redundancies. It's bad enough the drop rates are abysmal in these types of games and in SotN there were only a handful of monsters that were even worth farming items from, most of them for experience points and nothing more.\n\n90% of the monster abilities in this game are worthless but without using a guide you'd never know which monsters are worth the farm and which one's aren't. You'll spend countless hours farming pathetic enemies just to see what they'll give up and in the end, completely regret your actions.\n\n[h1]Die Monster, You Don't Belong In This World![/h1]\n\nSo yeah, even though SotN [The original on PSX] had atrocious voice acting, it was campy as hell and gives me that feeling of nostalgia every time I listen to it, it was like a cheesy 80's action movie or something and I love it.\n\nThe plot on this game however, is completely forgettable, the characters are also forgettable, no one cares, I honestly thought the 8-bit rendition of the game Bloodstained: Curse of the Moon, had a more cohesive plot on it. I honestly stopped caring about what was even going on in this game after the first few scenes, I quickly realised that I was here for the game play, nothing more.\n\nIf you're coming in to this looking for a compelling plot like SoTN, forget it, it's the same old garbage of good vs. evil, Miriam is a catalyst, just like Soma for housing evil, the evil is baiting her in to the castle, etc etc... ZzzZzzzZzzz.\n\n[h1]Final Verdict[/h1]\n\nThe game play is amazing, the more you progress the more fun it becomes, find all the chests, get the best loot, make yourself an unstoppable force. Yes the Valmanway / Crissaegrim [under a different name in this game] is in this game, it takes a ton of rare materials to acquire it as well but it's here, and breaks the game completely.\n\nThe game is littered with SotN references, not going to spoil them here, you'll know them when you encounter them, problem is this game feels more of an Aria of Sorrow homage than it does SotN just due to the shard binding system. I would have rather they kept the game more simple and less grindy but it is what it is.\n\nI'll still recommend it but if you hate Soma Cruz style games, you'll probably get annoyed quickly with this. I suggest getting a cheat engine table to increase drop rates so you won't have to bother with all the grinding because believe me, this game is ONE GIANT GRIND OUT. I tried to NG+ this thing but it's not worth experiencing twice, you can get the full experience in a single play through and there's nothing really new to experience the second time around.\n\nI honestly found myself craving to play SotN instead and wished that Konami had made another Castlevania game featuring Alucard at some point but it is what it is.\n\nPlot: 4 / 10\nGame Play: 9 / 10\nMusic: Mostly forgettable background noise. 5 /10\n\nI'll recommend it because I did enjoy the game play fighting mechanics a lot but overall it wasn't what I was expecting it to be and the plot was non-existent / pointless to even pay attention to.",Recommended

"As a longtime fan of the classic Castlevania: Symphony of the Night, I had my qualms about a ""spiritual successor"".I am happy to report that my qualms have been eased.  a wonderful game with loads of nods to the original game (and others).  My only, albiet minor, issue is the fact that you can not jump directly into the harder modes.  A minor issue, as i said.  Other than that, a few missing words on dialogue screens is really the only other issue I found with the game.  If you are a fan of SotN, you will greatly appreciate this game.",Recommended

"The grand return of the classic metroidvania style ! After Konami decided to abandon the Castlevania style for a more modern (and bad) full 3D, a kickstarter project allowed the style to be back, on another name.\nBut don't be fooled, if you enjoyed the Symphony of the Night, Arria of Sorrow, Danw of Sorrow... you should find familiar style and gameplay. The gameis good, with a lot of exploration, gears, shard to collect, and the gameplay is really smooth and responding. My main complain is the game ended being too short, took 12h to finish it, and I wanted more.",Recommended

"I've pretty much reached 100% on a first normal playthrough, in about 30 hours since I started spoiling some things, like the famous monster 44, at the very end of the run.\nThis didn't make me really want to move into hard or nightmare, so I'm pretty much waiting for more content.\nAlthough I did try Hard difficulty for a bit.\n\nOverall it's a pretty great game for all Castlevania fans.\nI wasn't so enthralled to play since Order of Ecclesia.\n\nGrinding is all right and pretty much part of the game, even more than previous Castlevania titles.\nHowever Alchemy is a good subsystem, which makes the repetitions satisfactory enough to keep going.\n\nHighly recommended for any Metroidvania player out there and really looking forward to the Roguelike dungeon!",Recommended

"This game was an absolute blast and one of my current favorites of 2019. It nails the SOTN feel where you can progress through twitch reflexes or methodical gear progression. The puzzles are clever, though it can be hard to figure out where to head next at times. The aesthetics are bright, engaging, and both environments, monsters, and characters all pop on the screen super well. It's playable (and beatable) even if you aren't a platform master and there are often clever solutions to battles, so preparation can be the key to winning a tough boss fight. \n\nAll an all a truly fantastic release from the founder of the genre. Moreover, the game has a mountain of free DLC coming that includes two new characters to play through the game with, so, for the price, its a steal. Instant classic and the best metroidvania I've played since SoTN all those years ago.",Recommended

pretty good,Recommended
"BIAS: I am a backer of this game. I spent more than the average amount to make it happen.\nA proper successor to the Igavania genre that gets the feeling of Castlevania JUST RIGHT. A must purchase for any fan of Symphony of the Night, Aria of Sorrow and Order of Ecclesia. Expertly crafted by Koji Igarashi and many of team responsible for the classics, along with signature music from Michuru Yamane that properly mirrors Castlevania with out infringing on any copy right. \n\nBugs and performance issues are minimal, but present. I've seen a moment or two where a word was missing from text dialogue box as it was being spoken. Seeing as voice overs came in later as a kickstarter goal, its an odd slip-up. Other players shown off Miriam's head being invisble when in the inventory screen. A near game breaking bug was reported making certain crates not obtainable until an update and new game save. Sometimes, enemies drop items and those items can get stuck in the terrain and become unobtainable. It seems the developer was aware of this issue because after a certain time (or even leaving the room i think) the item will be automatically obtained.\n\nVoice acting is pretty good, especially since the Kickstarter was able to hire voice actors iconic to previous Konami games, including David Hayter as Zangetsu and the Alucard rip-ff, Orlok Dracul, voiced by the original Alucard voice actor from SoTN. It's my understanding that the Japanese counterparts are here as well.\n\nThere's only a few complains I can really offer for fans of Symphony of The Night. The Normal difficulty is much easier in comparison to SoTN - a few bosses gave me trouble as I had to fight them a dozen times, and a few segments are tough as newer areas with newer enemies will do alot more damage to you and can get you easily killed before you reach a save, though I generally got to the save point the second time around. To be fair, the name never advertised itself as difficult, and I feel that default semi-high difficulty was a common thing from retro games. That said, you can unlock harder difficulties by beating the game or entering the proper code as your save file name. You can also use this feature for special Kickstarter reward gear if you can find them from guides.\n\nThe other complaint is the lack of the Castlevania legacy. On the one hand, being free from the constraints of the Castlevania storyline and Konami's demands allows the developer to do as they please with their own franchise. On the other hand, all the history and legacy that comes with the series can't be used here. No longer do we have the Belmont clan hunting down Dracula every 100 years as Castlevania is resurrected while slaying monsters and bosses that referenced early horror movies. Now we have a girl that kinda-sorta looks like Shanoa from OoE that is trying to kill the antagonist that kinds-sorta looks like Dracula and Alucard combined while killing enemies and using weapon and abilities that kinda-sorta look like Castlevania weapons and abilities while exploring a castle that kinda-sorta looks and feels much like Castlevania and was resurrected from the ground, but isn't Castlevania. You no longer have the iconic music to pull from that became my personal favorite game music of all time - the same composer who worked on remixes of those tracks are here, and yet, she won't have the ability to remix those songs anymore. This is a Castlevnia game all but in branding and name, and it would be a sequel in the series if it could, but it can't. \n\nAll that said, I am a backer of this game whom spent a lot of money on this on Kickstarted and I got exactly what I was promised, except for the extra rewards which I assume are to come later. (modes, characters, physical rewards). If you wanted more Igavania as seen from the PSX and GBA/DS era, then you should not hesitate to get Bloodstained.\n\nNOTE: I may reconstruct this review to be more like my previous reviews. I just wanted to put my thoughts down and make a review for the Summer Steam sale event, but it deserved a good review that got longer than I expected.",Recommended

"What can be said about this that hasn't already been said?  Finally a call back to the classic Castlevania games we all grew up with, and this delivers in full force.  Tons of items to collect, a huge map to explore, a pretty basic yet effective story, and some fun challenges make this game extremely solid.\n\nIga set out to make a game that pays homage to games like Symphony of the Night, and honestly that's pretty much exactly what you're getting.  The game plays relatively similar.  Combat is rather limited but given some time to learn the controls and some tech here and there and it can become surprisingly fast paced and complex in certain boss battles depending on your strategy.  At the start your mobility is rather limited but as you progress you gain more and more options until by the end of it all you're flying over every tedious obstacle that previously gave you trouble and nothing is quite as satisfying as that.\n\nThere's some very welcome secret areas and extra bosses that are a pretty fun challenge.  Trying to find every collectible on the map led to some very welcome exploration sections, as well as times where you could obtain some items early using knowledge of game mechanics, and when those moments happened it honestly feels great.\n\nI will say, despite how much fun the game is, it is a little light on content.  The main game took me somewhere in the neighborhood of 20 hours, and that's with me farming to get the best items in the game as well as every shard and filling the demon list.  A casual playthrough will probably hover around 10-15 hours depending on skill.  I do wish there was more here, but I'm not gonna look a gift horse in the mouth.  I wanted classic SotN, and that's basically what I got.  I leave a happy camper.\n\nThat's not to say there aren't flaws worth addressing.  For one, while the soundtrack is phenomenal, the graphics themselves tend to be not so much.  The environments tend to be a bit bland and generic, and sometimes it's difficult to find any cohesive flow between certain areas and others.  Enemy design is also pretty simplistic, with later game enemies tending to be reskined upgrades of previous enemy models.  At the end of the day though, I think this is a fairly nitpicky point however.  The art direction while not revolutionary by any stretch is still very good in my opinion.  At the very least, it's certainly much better than what it WAS, and I'm glad they were so receptive of the criticism and managed to turn it around.\n\nOverall I think I'll rate this an 8/10.\n\nAs a fanboy for this stuff, I might be a bit biased, but still I can understand why some would be turned away.  I wish there was more content and that the main game itself was a bit less linear.  However, with multiple free DLC modes coming in the near future, I think the content aspect can be accounted for.  Hell i still haven't even done my NG+ yet, which does indeed add some more nuance to getting through the game.\n\nIf you like metroidvanias, especially SotN, you'll love this game.  If you don't, then there isn't much here to ease you into the genre and force you to take a second perspective.  Look for games that push the limits of the genre for something like that, for instance Hollow Knight, and if you like that game then maybe come back and give this one a try.  If this game were cheaper, I would probably be recommending it more forcefully, but at $40 you should definitely only get this game if you know you're probably gonna like it.  And if you do, you'll like it a lot.",Recommended

These review is simple these is a Castlevania (Metroidvania-style) game in every aspect except the name.\n\nFound just a couple of performance issues.\nIs extremely random and am sure is an optimization problem but at random places the frame drop like crazy. I can simulated because is as I said randomly.,Recommended

"I really miss playing Castlevania so I purchased it on its 2nd day of release. I can say it's really all worth it! The feel, enemies the mechanics and the environment. I'm still completing this masterpiece! Thank you Iga and may you bless us with more content thru updates for this game. Cheers!",Recommended
Really captures the symphony of the night essence :yay:,Recommended
i love it but i hate the jank.,Recommended
"In brief:\n\nPros: Great core gameplay, excellent tone and art design, stellar cast,\n\nCons: Mediocre graphics with poor optimization (though pretty nicely detailed environments), lackluster cutscenes, final areas of the game are pretty disappointing.\n\nNitpicks: Weapon type variety is pretty nice, but unlockable weapon techniques are poorly spread among weapon types. Boss design was inconsistent, some nice ones, some very dull. First area that was used in the demo clearly had fully designed mechanics that were entirely dropped for the rest of the game.\n\nAll in all, the game fully lived up to the hype, but isn't perfect, the optimization is probably the biggest flaw, but it truly undeniably earns its title of Symphony of the Night's spiritual successor.",Recommended
"Great game\nBloodstained is basically a remake of Symphony of the Night, without the Castlevania IP.\nThere are various playstyles you can play the game with and a large variety of spells and summons you can perform to either improve that playstyle or to deviate from it.\nThe music is made from the composer of the Castlevania games.\nMain offputting thing for me at first was the art design which is a weird 3d design to the character but after an hour I got accustomed to it.\nWell worth it and I can't wait to get into new game+ to try other builds and see the differences.",Recommended
"41 Hours and 10 seconds in I completed this game 100%. That is every item, shard, space on the map, recipe, and achievement. And I would do it all again in a heart beat. Koji Igarashi has outdone himself with this masterpiece. Growing up I was introduced to Castlevania with Aria of Sorrow on the GBA and every minute of this game brings back the fond memories I had pouring hours into that game any chance I could get my hands on it. Truly a wonderful nostalgia bomb of an experience full of new mechanics and that same old castlevania style difficulty in having to piece together where to go next yourself. If you are a fan of this man's work, buy this game. You will NOT be disappointed.",Recommended
Definitely wasn't sure about this game as I played through the first hour or so because it just seemed so simple and repetitive. But then I kept finding more things. And then there were more things after that.\n\nThis game has a lot of things.,Recommended
haven't play much but its just symphony of the night and that's a good thing,Recommended
Very similar to Symphony of the Night. Great game and mechanics.,Recommended
The game we've been waiting for,Recommended
Love this game its super fun i was worried that the bosses might be to hard for me to beat but ive beat 11 of them so far and only had a few issues with 2 of them \ntheres not really any bugs but once i did have an issue with getting stuck in a part of the ground and once when i opened the game save file the voice of my character kept cutting out but im not sure if that was from the game or a problem on my end overall great game 10/10,Recommended
"Just started but man what a game. super fun, beautiful and has addicting game play. will update as i go.\nCastlevania: Symphony of the night 2 lol\n\nUpdate: Just beat the story and quests but still haven't 100% the map, items or shards. lots of weapons and magic spells(shards) each one makes your character play differently. you can focus on your favorite ones and upgrade them to make them better.. i don't remember the last time a game enthralled me so much as to play it and think about it all the time. this is that game for me. can't wait for the future updates and i will update it once i've completed even more. truly love this game. if you like castlevania or metroid games this is definitely a must get.",Recommended
This game turned out to be a decent castlevania just what I wanted.,Recommended
"it's castlevania, but not pachinko\n10/10",Recommended
game of the year no question asked,Recommended
"I highly suggest giving this game its fair play through if you are at all a fan of the metroidvania style games, more so if you are a long time fan of the castlevania series as this game is littered with plenty of nods to the past castlevania titles.\nPros: the game play is just like the games of the past but given new life with new mechanics, a much higher level of visual quality than games of the past, an interesting and unique castle grind with a nice diversity of mechanics to traverse it.\nCons: there are still some bugs with the game but it is being worked over, and Zangetsu still isnt a playable character yet, and the quests seem really boring and droll but the pay off for doing them all is well worth the monotony",Recommended
If you liked Symphony of the Night you gotta buy this,Recommended
This is amazing game if you like Castlevania Symphony of the night you will love this game,Recommended
"There's about 24 hours of gameplay here if you're not rushed and want a reasonable degree of completion (map, souls, items). It is very much an Iga Castlevania game, which is not a bad thing. It's good, it's fun, and when the free DLC for another character comes out, I'm sure I'll play it again.",Recommended
"I am so glad this game turned out good.\n\nBloodstained comes from around the same Kickstarter era as Mighty No. 9, where companies like Capcom and Konami weren't making the series' we wanted, so former producers of said series were turning to Kickstarter to essentially make successor games. Mighty No. 9 would be the stand-in for Mega Man, and this would be for Castlevania.\n\nThankfully, this game did not suffer the same fate as Mighty No. 9 did. Bloodstained will be remembered as a Kickstarter success story, and thank goodness for that. I love this game. The visuals look great (for the most part), the music is superb, the gameplay tight, VA is well done, and the exploration satisfying. If you're a fan of Castlevania: Symphony of the Night and other titles like it, it's a must-buy for sure. But even beyond that, I feel that it will appeal to pretty much any fan of Action RPGs.",Recommended
"Backdashing is love, backdashing is life\n\n10/10",Recommended
"I have been waiting over 20 years for this game. Quite literally a 10/10 for the genre. Extremely rewarding and enjoyable gameplay with a ton of variability and customization, exceptional graphics and environments, great music and sound effects, and quality voice acting. Can't wait for the DLC.\n\nBut enough review! Buy it, you!",Recommended
Turned out far better than I could have imagined.,Recommended
"A great return to the classic Castlevania formula with SOTN being an obvious influence. \n\nPros:\n+ Fantastic soundtrack\n+ Runs great on PC, one slight frame dip before a boss in the first area which was repeatable, but nothing beyond that\n+ Art style is fantastic\n+ Shards gained form enemies are fairly unique and can change the gameplay drastically, especially if you farm them to max.\n+ Bosses are fun and challenging\n+ Great and sometimes hilarious Easter eggs.\n\nA few things I didn't like:\n- Sometimes the game is not very clear about where to go or what to do. Somewhat typical of a Metroidvania type game, but there are some pretty obscure things that need to happen in order to progress, which will likely have you on google in a few spots.\n\n- RNG can be heavy if you're going for certain upgrades. Some very rare drops around the 1% rate and boosting luck stats will only help you so much. Late game farming will have you fighting some easy enemies, leaving the area, and returning to hopefully get that one drop you need. Realistically, you will do that about 500 more times. Not necessary to complete the game though\n\n- Some bosses can be a bit spongy. Did not like the DLC boss due insane range of his weapons and getting close to him means you're likely getting hit for a sizable chunk of health as you hope to whittle down his 9k (literally) hit points.\n\n- 100% map completion can be annoying (if you're going for it) since you will likely be combing over a completed map and hopefully identifying breakable walls you probably missed. There is a shard to help with this, but you're likely going to miss several walls before you get it.\n\nOverall I'd recommend it. If you can put up with some completionist annoyances, there will definitely be more than 20  hours of game here. I did roughly 75% of things with a considerable amount of grinding and got 20 hours. Probably looking at 16 or so if you're just looking to complete the story.",Recommended
It's a great game you can tell a lot of love was put in it.,Recommended
"A Recommended successor to SOTN, Bloodstained does not disappoint.",Recommended
"Holy Mary Mother of God... now *this* is how you do a spiritual successor!\n\n[b]""He was told there was no future, but he knew they were wrong""[/b] couldn't be any more accurate if it tried. Konami, ""The Suits©"" and god knows whoever else it was that said Castlevania had no future, that the classic Metroidvania types had no future, instead giving us a pair of soulless God of War button mashers, seriously needs to be fired.\n\nThis was *magnificent*! Truly, utterly, magnificent! Start to finish it gripped me in its embrace and sucked my time and attention like the proverbial vampires themselves. Beautiful visuals, great VA, fantastic and deliciously atmospheric soundtrack, an enormous game world to explore, puzzles to solve, dozens upon dozens of monsters to battle with, and delightful amounts of loot to hunt down and collect -- what more could a Metroidvania fan ask for? This honestly was superb and was, indeed, worth the wait! It was worth more than the 4 year wait from Kickstarter; I'll go as far as to say it was worth the 11 year wait since the last truly great Castlevania title; [b]Order of Ecclesia[/b], because make no mistake.. this is every bit Castlevania in every way but name and is very much worthy of notice by any and all that claim to be CV fans.\n\nMagnificent!",Recommended
I gave a man money to make Castlevania Symphony of the Night again. He did it. \n\n10/10,Recommended
"It's genuinely a love letter to those of us who grew up with Castlevania, especially ""Symphony of the Night"".  Beautifully crafted and large enough to keep you guessing and entertained for hours upon hours.  Well done, IGA!",Recommended
"I really enjoyed this game. I generally don't play these kind of games but it got me pretty hooked. It's been on my wishlist but I was lucky since my friend gifted me the game since he had a free copy. That aside...for the review:\n\nAs I mentioned, I don't generally play these kinds of games but the graphics and gameplay got me pretty hooked. I think it's probably the combination between the anime style and Metroidvania gameplay. There's also a nice mix between 2D and 3D graphics which gives it almost that full 3D feel. I would definitely buy a sequel or prequel if the developers ever end up making another one.\n\nI don't have much to say for cons. I presume most people might say that the bosses get easy once you get the hang of it but for the most part, they still get tougher or just crank up the difficulty. Regardless, I don't have much else to say other than this was a really good game. Thumbups!",Recommended

"Everything you want in a vania game. Fantastic, although I wish I got to fight bosses a bit sooner in the game.",Recommended
"If you like the igavania titles (symphony of the night, aria of sorrow, etc) then you will most likely love this game. \n\nPros:\n- Movement feels fluid, lots of control in the air\n- Tons of different weapon variety, lots of room for different playstyles\n- Lots of cool abilities (shards), and obtaining them is much easier than in some other igavanias (like AoS)\n- Some cool boss fights\n- Music is great\n\nCons:\n- Buggy water physics before you get the ability to traverse water, and the water just looks pretty bad in general\n- The cavern models look really poor and out of place, and the collision on them is not great either\n- Too few boss fights, and several of the boss fights can be cheesed easily",Recommended

Enough talk...,Recommended
funny fun game,Recommended
"It's not perfect.  The period when you cannot move, immediately follow an attack is a little too long.  The enemies are a little too prone to slamming into you or dips in height that put them frustratingly out of reach without going into the menu to change a weapon.  Finally, too many abilities that are required to progress need to be equipped or selected from a menu.  The souls and gear aren't balanced, and some of them will make things WAY easier.  Like Bunnymorphosis.  Holy shit that thing can kill bosses.\n\nAaaaaand, I'm out of bitching.  It is Castlevania come again.  Not an entry in the genre.  The old series come back to life.  That is such a stellar achievement.  The jump attacks feel right, the dodge backs feel right, the weapons hit boxes feel right (and unique).  It's not even stale.  There are plenty of innovations over its predecessors.  The crafting system is better than just using gold.  Souls aren't required to craft equipment (SCREW THAT), and rare drops just aren't THAT rare.  The style is different, the monsters are refreshing.  The level design is good.  Techniques are easier to use.  This game is a reminder why people weren't just satisfied playing metroidvania games.  They wanted THESE mechanics back, and we have them.  And I'm just so damn happy.",Recommended
On the first level of the game I went against a woman - looking monster with tentacles. I got Japanesed. And I like it. 10 games over of 10,Recommended
Feels so similar to SotN without feeling like a direct copy. Can't wait to see what Iga has in store for the new franchise!,Recommended
Insanely addicting for a completionist like myself. 10/10,Recommended
"If you love Metroidvania type games, you definitely can't go wrong with this game. A little short imo, but it makes up for it with nostalgia, lovely graphics, and of course OST.",Recommended
This takes me back to when i played Castlevania Aria Of Sorrow on the gba and man did i love it Bloodstained makes me relive the nostagia i have when playing that and i love it hands down my favorite game of this year,Recommended
"Konami may be little more than a shell of its former self, but its legacy lives on in its displaced staff.  While Symphony of the Night remains the pinnacle of the genre, Bloodstained is a tremendous labor of love and dedication by Iga and his team and one of the few kickstarters to truly deliver on its promises.  It's a little sillier, a lot tougher, and a bit more loose than SotN, but if that game needed a queen, then this would be it.  It's just a shame they couldn't get Toru Hagihara to work on this and make it truly astounding.",Recommended
Fantastic,Recommended

Lovely game,Recommended
Amazing if you loved the metroidvania Castlevania that Iga was known for. A must for Castlevania fans.,Recommended
"I was a bit tepid about Bloodstained: Ritual of Night pre-release, but the game has turned out to be a great experience. The game play is fluid and dynamic offering a wide variety of weapon types and movement styles. The game offers a straightforward narrative experience with little grinding for those who want it, and a deep variety of farming and grinding for those who prefer that style of game. I keep finding myself getting sucked into game sessions MUCH longer than I anticipated playing. It just keeps me coming back for more.\n\nThere are a few negatives. I'm not a huge fan of the visual style and some of the character models are a bit crusty. The voice acting is a little on the nose. The game mostly does a good job and guiding the player towards achievable goals, but sometimes there lacks clarity in direction. Some of the side-quests (I'm looking at you granny-forgets-her-food) are too grindy for my tastes.\n\nOverall I'm really impressed with this game and I ended up liking it a lot more than I thought I would.",Recommended
Good,Recommended
"IGA delivered. I backed this years ago, and if you like the old Metroidvania style gameplay, this is it in spades. Such a great game!",Recommended
"As a huge fan of Symphony of the Night, this scratches that itch pretty well.\nI've recommended it to many friends so far, and I should expect to recommend it to more",Recommended
"Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night is good, but it is definitely in need of more polish and content. I don't want to rate it poorly, but it is definitely a 6 or 7 / 10 right now as opposed to something truly spectacular.\n\nA lot of its design decisions lie in the past for this genre, which makes sense if you knew what you were getting into as it is basically a re-hash of Aria of Sorrow/Symphony of the Night. It is grindy and really easy on your first play through and its bosses aren't particularly interesting compared to something more fleshed out like Hollow Knight or Valdis Story. The RPG elements actually hurt the bosses in this game, if you are playing as a completionist on your first pass you're going to crap on everything you meet. \n\nThere's a lot of content in the pipe here, but if you're not incredibly bored at the moment I'd entirely advise waiting for a sale or for more of that content to drop.",Recommended
"I wasn't sure about this game at first. It looked ok, but I couldn't pull the trigger on it. After playing it I gotta say, this is about as close to Symphony of the Night you are gonna get on a modern platform. It is very fun and really does have that SoTN feel. It's got the shard system that emulates the soul system that Soma used in Aria of Sorrow. It's got special techniques for weapon you find like SoTN. Exploration, music, and combat all all great. I really do recommend this game if you loved SoTN like I did.",Recommended
It was worth the wait,Recommended
The best metroidvania I've played in years.,Recommended
"If you love Symphony of the night or most of the gba/ds castlevanias play this game. Like now, buy it and play it. What are you waiting for?",Recommended
"Approx. 70% done with my first playthrough. This game is almost 1:1 with Castlevania: Symphony of the Night in how it feels, looks, and sounds, but it is unique and original with its cast and presentation. You can tell just how much time and effort was put into making this game through every room and enemy you advance through. It's easy to pick up and is challenging enough to keep you engaged and feeling like you're improving. Exploration is a blast and the secrets you find along the way give a great sense of progression. This game is worth the hype and if you enjoy Metroid, Castlevania, Hollow Knight, or Dead Cells, this one is right up your alley.",Recommended
"If you played Castelvania: Symphony of the Night, play this game already. It is a love letter to metroidvanias everywhere. It takes a VERY long time to get fast, however it was a blast to play through it. It is a short game, but I had fun every moment I played it!\n\n9/10",Recommended
This game is neat!,Recommended
"Amazing game, it really feels the Castlevania SOTN sucessor. Give it a try and you will just to want to play this ""metroidvania"" until you finishes it.\n\nAmazing soundtrack, RPG elements in the game and a lot of secrets to be discovered.\n\nI really recommend it.\n",Recommended
soooo gwed,Recommended
"i really liked it. its kinda pretty and the game is focused on beauty from what i saw. but the story is also good (not great, mind you) and the game is fun. lots of stuff to do with the shards, you can become op with luck (i like that XD) and the crafting system is simple. \n\nthere are those that say that this is a copy of castlevania, but i think this game focused more on beauty than castlevania soooo... its the same system as SotN but the way the story moves, the gameplay and such little things (like playing a piano) made this game good for me :)\n\nhope you like it.",Recommended
"For a guy who doesn't have much nostalgia for the genre, I'm having my good old bit of fun with this game!",Recommended

"Can be tough as nails, but this side-scrolling 2.5D is a pleasure to look at and play.  Bloodstained puts you in the role of a young lady who underwent an experiment that went slightly awry. When she awakens ten years to the day she had entered a coma, demons are on the loose and her new ability to absorb demon shards and stand against them is all that stands between victory and demonic defeat.\nplays smoothly, controls like a dream and all the weapons and combinations have unique feels to them presenting you with a variety of play styles to choose from.\nI haven't hit a single bug yet and framerates remain constant throughout.\n8.5 outta 10",Recommended

The game is very well made and feels great to play. Definitely recommended!,Recommended
Truly a spiritual successor to  SOTN.,Recommended
"Great Game.  If you liked Castlevania SOTN or any of the DS/GBA games, then you will enjoy this title.  Just wish there was more game to play.  What is here is a well-polished Metrovania with a good sound track and diversity to enemies, drops, crafting and weapons.  The only issue I have with the game was how so many of the weapon types fall to the wayside during the game and never get used.  But on the other hand, if having too much to play with is the main complaint, then there is plenty of diversity to go around.",Recommended
Not recommending this game is probably the hardest thing I've ever had to do.\n\nI loved SOTN. I loved all the Recommended Metroidvania games that IGA worked on. I've been a fan of Castlevania for a better part of my life. So why? Why would I not recommend this game? Especially since this is just like SOTN with a different coat of paint? Simple. It was like no one tested it. Game loves to crash at the worst times (see: when you are saving.) Spent a good chunk of time farming up a drop? Too bad. It no longer counts. \n\nMaybe one day this game will run problem free. But that's not today and after waiting as long as we did for it. I don't think it's expecting too much to want a game that would run properly.\n\nWhat a horrible night to have a curse.,Not Recommended
The best Igavania I ever played. Surpasses Symphony. A wonderful experience.,Recommended
Other than a few clipping issues this brought back all the feels from SotN and is a brilliant game that any fan of Metroidvania would be proud to hold in their library.,Recommended
"Never played any of the Castlevania titles or much of any Metroidvania before this, but two friends of mine were super hyped for this game so I decided to give it a shot as well. \nGotta say, not looking back, as I've sunk a good amount of hours into it in just a few days and will continue to do so. \nLooking forward to all the promised and hopefully coming updates, this certainly got me hooked and interested in the genre.",Recommended

"Worth addition to anyone's library or if you're just a fan of some classic Iga action. Good music, some slight cosmetic choices (may become more in depth with a sequel) and even has some humor. Snakegetsu is a plus, as is Totally Not Alucard's involvement. Game will be even more fun, once the rest of the features are implemented into the game, such as Boss Revenge, Co-op and the bonus playable characters. There is also a nice little tease at the future of the series, before the screen cuts to credits, after finishing the game, watch the shadows closely. Product is listed as being received for free, due to being a mid-tier backer for this game.",Recommended

And of course many secrets to uncover.\n\nMy only complaint is that the armor you wear doesn't change your character model much at all, with a couple exceptions.",Recommended
Solid game. I like the variety of weapon types. Some farming required if you want better shards but isn't too bad. Not too hard to get into and the learning curve isn't steep. I feel like I got my money's worth. Solid 4/5.,Recommended
One of the few games that I sat down and beat without losing interest,Recommended
i had doubts when i came in here in this game because games these days aint what they used to be no love no honor no pride.

Shout to the devs and the guy from symphony of the night you are the best man :). \n\nThis gives me hope thats it not over yet!!!!,Recommended
"If you like symphony of the Night, if you like Dawn of Sorrow, then this is the game for you. if you're a big fan of the recent games such as Hollow Knight, this is not really like that. this is more like the classics. The difficulty is well balanced for my liking, whereas I find a lot of the recent games to be too difficult just for the sake of being difficult. They seem to ape dark souls, this does not. \nThere are issues in it, sure. there are glitches and balancing concerns that have caused some players some headache, but you can overcome these with a bit of a search. \n",Recommended
Have fun with igavania. If you like castlevania you should play this game.,Recommended
"Iga is absolutely back and Bloodstained may be one of his finest yet. If you're a fan of Castlevania you're doing a disservice to yourself not playing this.\n\nGameplay: 9.5/10 Gameplay overall is very clean and satisfying, it may be even better than SoTN to be honest. From the many MANY weapons to choose from, to the awesome directional shards, to the kickass boss fights all around very fun to play!\n\nStory: 6.5/10 The story was only okay in my opinion, and that's not necessarily bad as most Igavania's tend to have less of a focus on story. Some things like who the Recommended villain was were extremely obvious if you ask me, however overall it was alright.\n\nGraphics: 8/10 Graphically speaking the game looks pretty, but I can't say it looks gorgeous. Some things in the game still look a bit muddy, however the lighting is really good, but I'm not sure if I'd say it's extremely good. Still nonetheless the graphics aren't bad and they look way better than they did in the past.\n\nMusic: 9/10 It's an Igavania game do you seriously expect bad music? The music in this game is fantastic as it always is. As far as I'm concerned no game he's worked on has bad music and it shows here with yet another amazing soundtrack that's candy to the ears.\n\nOverall: 9/10 It's not a perfect game, but very few games are. Still this game was exactly what I wanted and more, and if you love Castlevania or even just Metroidvanias in general you really need to play it. I am very excited to see what Iga and his team will come up with next. Thank you to everyone who helped make this awesome game come Recommended!",Recommended

An excellent entry in the line of Igavanias.,Recommended
Fun game,Recommended
"While I feel it failed to capture the SotN atmosphere, maybe because of the 3D graphics, or the theme, It's a solid 9/10 Metroidvania i'd recommend to anyone who is into the genre.\nThe controls feel tight and responsive, weapons are varied enough and feel good to use. I'm halfway through the game, having gotten one of the bad endings, pushing through to see the rest. Might revisit the review once i've finished it.",Recommended
"This is just what I expected. The music is amazing, the gameplay is fun, and I'm really enjoying my time with this game.",Recommended
"This game is a blast. It's challenging, it's open, it's fun and it has a LOT to offer. My full review can be found here, but I'll put a TL;DR here as well: https://youtu.be/O6bKnAWEa7U \n\n\npros:\n- Nice Graphics\n- BEAUTIFUL soundtrack \n- Huge variety of equipment and builds available \n- Several customization options for character\n- Decent story\n- Decent Challenge on Normal without being rage-inducing\n\nCons:\n- Hard and Nightmare mode are an absolute pain in the very early parts.\n- A few bugs and performance issues\n- Quests feel like they could be a bit more interesting \n- Some enemies aren't hard, they're just annoying\n\nAll in all it's worth more than the asking price. If you want a good metroidvania title, this is the one for you!",Recommended
"Very good game\nGood soundtrack\nSolid Game play (controls are good) \nLot of weapons, items and skills to use\n\nAlthough there are a few glitches here and there  at times . Like the game crashing on reading from bookshelves. Also leaving the room and killing all enemies too quickly with skills like Tepes Oceous will make it crash sometimes too. The few glitches did not make me want to stop playing the game all I can say is save often. \n\nThis is all the Castlevania I needed for a long time passing no killing poor Dracula again for the 100th time  is required.\nAlso rip konami... We wont miss you just make sure you stay dead so we don't whip out the Oak Stake.",Recommended
"If you love playing Metroidvania games, this game is a must buy. It is definitely up there with SoTN. And even if you've never played a Metroidvania game before, you should still play this game because it is just that good.",Recommended
Have you ever wanted to be a waman with colorful tattoos who eats meth to get stronger? I have and this game delivers!,Recommended
"I was curious to see how a game in the Symphony of the Night formula would hold up not just to my nostalgia, but to modern games such as Hollow Knight, Salt & Sanctuary, and Dead Cells. The answer is, Bloodstained holds up very well! In fact, it feels like a reminder of what makes this genre work so well. It feels short compared to Hollow Knight, but it is not the worse for that. I have very much enjoyed running through the castle again on New Game+, which is not something I usually do. However, the collection and quest systems in this game invite repeated play-throughs.\n\nTo be clear, the story is pretty ""meh."" You may find yourself searching google for how to progress at some point (this game really forces you to explore every nook and cranny, there is a required armor piece in particular that is located in a fairly nonsensical place and you cannot move forward without it.)\n\nMusic and graphics are excellent. The game itself has personality and charm. I highly recommend this game to fans of the genre, or for folks who are looking for an entry point into Metroidvania-style games.",Recommended
such a  great game when can we get the dlc,Recommended
Закачаешься как круто.,Recommended
"This game was a delight and more than anything I could have asked for when I backed it in 2015. A must for any Castlevania fan or a fan of the Metroidvania genre. It had a few quirks, but none of them directly impeded the enjoyment of the game for me. Thank you Koji Igarashi and here's to hopefully a sequel in the future!",Recommended
"Great game, takes you back to Castlevania times.\nNo bugs came though game play.\n\nBut don't like cooking portion, as you need to memorize which monster drops which ingredient, and there is no way to map it.",Recommended
Game is spectacular. Symphony of the NIght + Dawn of Sorrow and done very very well.,Recommended
Amazing Game,Recommended
"Delivers exactly what was promised: A solid classic metroidvania experience. The games lose its way in places, such as figuring out the waterway, but overall is a great love letter.",Recommended
"Well, after nearly putting in 40 hours into this game and almost exploring every nook and cranny this backer supported game has to offer, I have to say I'm disappointed to not be disappointed!!!\n\n9/10 Plans on playing it again!* (Scroll to the bottom on this review will change later from later on free DLCs)\n\nI'm just gonna cut to the chase. If you're an avid Metroidvainia fanatic who wants to play a title made by the father who started it all, then play this game. The story is decent. It has it's own type of mystery that is behind what is going on. The characters are pretty fleshed out and have some very familiar voice actors you may have heard before in past games, movies, or TV shows.  *Coughs* David Hayter!* Cough* Aside all of that, the main meat of the game is the game play. Does it accomplish what it's suppose to be? Well, answer is yes and then some. I've play Castlevainia: SOTN and a few various Metroidviania games in the past. You'd expect this feels it has a bit of a Dawn Of Sorrow like game play. Yet, it adds more to it. There's wide range of weapons, armors, equipment, abilities, and even crafting and cooking food! \n\nInstead of using traditional potions, you can make food that you try the first time, gives you a permanent boost on stats! You can even make new equipment that range from various weapon types, ammunition, and even enhance your abilities to increase power or even additional stats. Not to mention, some certain weapons have special techniques that can be used over and over again. Once they are mastered, they can be used on the specific weapon class that can be used on that new weapon that was not able to use that technique, can use it now. But in order to find everything I have mentioned, you're gonna have to explore the game to find and try to discover where you can get them.\n\nThe only negative I can give for this game is, like all Metroidvaina games, you're gonna have a lot of constant backtracking and possibly grinding to get the certain items you're looking for or to progress to the next area. Such as, you need a certain skill or equipment to get from point A to point B.\n\nThe game has a lot of secrets that can lead to hidden rooms and stuff hidden in walls or floors. See if you can find them. Trying to 100$ completion to this game is a task that may seem impossible to do. It can be done with time and patience. If you have that.\n\nAll and all, I think backers have to be pleased that they finally got the game they gave their hard earned money and support for a genera that is considered to be ""dead to today's videogame publishers and their standards of gaming today."" Well Iga, you have proved them wrong. Not only that, but may have proved people who have been skeptical about backer supported games that might turn into complete garbage to be wrong as well. Hope the time and wait showed that it can make a game good and not rushed for a quick buck. Makes a smile on my face.\n\nAnyway, if this review is not enough to get you to play this game, I dunno what will.\n\nX3\n\n*As of now, I only completed the game on Normal difficulty. There is a hard and nightmare difficulty in the game as well. Not to mention a New Game+ after beating the game first time around. I'm more interested on the future free DLCs that will be coming for the game on a later date. Which are to be as follows in the video of the game that shows, new characters, a co-op and possibly online co-op to explore the game, verses mode, and so on. I have my fingers crossed for you, Iga. Do plan on giving us more ASAP. I wanna go through the castle more than one time than just Miriam, our lead protagonist.",Recommended
My saves got corrupted,Recommended
"It's pretty good, I mean they got a character named after Jack Black's nickname in Tenacious D. Wait, that isn't right. Well shit",Recommended
"A fantastic experience where if you loved Castlevania, this game is for you. A grand time!",Recommended
"Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night is surprisingly fresh improvement over traditional castlevania - and metroidvania as a whole. This factor may come as a surprise considering there have been many high quality metroidvania game in the indie scene since the kickstarter of this game, such as the Hollow Knight and the Dead Cells.\n\nWhat Bloodstained offers over those games are surprising amount of complexity - Very first complexity you notice is that even earliest enemies have more than one attack and/or movement pattern to show.\n\nThis complexity allows game to feel fresh despite of constant supply of high quality metroidvania we had, and allows game to be quite challenging despite of large amount of power game quickly allows you to access. (Of course, game could be break opened once you know enough of its trick.)\n\nHow the game exactly feels thanks to improvement in complexities are difficult to put into words, but it definitely shows why Igarashi needed extra development time to develop the game.\n\nPolishing is superb as well, despite of 3D, it feels quite smooth if computer is up for the task.\n\nProblems in the game are more obvious: Performance.\n\nPerformance requirement doesn't seems to match what you see in the game - This is likely caused by the fact that game probably loads and renders significantly more portion of the game that is invisible to the player in order to remove much loading as possible. In 2D, this wouldn't have incurred significant cost, but in 3D, they are likely not rendered lazily.\n\nEither way, it is really great to see this succeeds, especially because so many early major kickstarter game projects lead by veteran japanese developer failed. It will be interesting to see where Igarashi will spin the series in the future.",Recommended
Love it. The end.,Recommended
Doesn't suck.,Recommended
ye its good,Recommended
"I've never really felt compelled to review a game before, but this is fantastic. I've been a big fan of Symphony of The Night and Dawn of Sorrow for about two years now (not long, I know), and this lives up to everything I love from both of those games, plus its own spin and additions to the formula. I'm really glad this came out the way it did. I've gotten just about every achievement, shard, items, even maxed out all but one of the passive shards. If you like any of the igavania games prior, I'd highly recommend it. Thank you, IGA!",Recommended
This is what we've been waiting for ten years.\nIt's almost perfect for Castlevania fans. I spent 30+ hours after the release date.\n\nBut the Chinese translation (both simplified Chinese and traditional Chinese) is really bad.\nThere are also tiny bugs and program crushes during playing.\n\nLooking forward to 13 free DLCs.,Recommended
Bloodstained is terrific. If you loved Symphony of the Night.. BUY THIS.,Recommended
"I didn't know if I'd like the game based on the videos but it's really good, What you would expect from a castlevania game.",Recommended
"This game is definitely meant for those who have played and liked Castlevania: Symphony of the Night. The beginning of the game may be slow and can get somewhat cringy but it gets better and better as you progress. I believe that other reviewers have done more detailed reviews already. Therefore, as someone who has already completed the game by 100%, I'll just post some general TIPS and TRICKS for those who are yet to play or finish the game without spoiling the story.\n\n- When it comes to upgrading your shards.. yellow ones should be the priority to get max rank because the effects will be permanently active once you maxed out the shard ranks.\n\n- Those who find the game too difficult combat wise .. do not forget to prepare and eat the food in the game. Unlike SOTN, Bloodstained ROTN's food gives you permanent stat boosts if you eat it for the first time in addition to restoring HP.\n\n- When you get the double jump ability, you'll also be able to jump kick downwards which the game doesn't tell you. You can jump kick your enemies or candles to bounce back into the air while enabling you to perform the double jump again. If you use that technique wisely, you'll be able to reach seemingly unreachable locations early on without unlocking more abilities in late game.\n\n- Don't be lazy to mark the unreachable areas or locked doors on the map. Even doing so, ever get stuck after traveling most of the areas on the map and don't know where to go??..... carefully take a look at the map again for even the tiniest of spots that you couldn't reach earlier in certain big areas. There's always something in places like that.\n\nTL;DR?\n- Eat food in the game.\n- Enhancing yellow shards > enhancing other shards.\n- Double jump allows you to jump kick on enemies can candles. Can get to even higher places.\n- Map awareness tip .. can't shorten this one though.\n\nSorry for long text. Hope you enjoy the game.",Recommended
If you're a fan of the Metroidvana genre Bloodstained:Ritual of the Night will scratch that itch and scratch it pretty well. The music is amazing and the gameplay hasn't changed from most metroidvana games. I love this game so much I started practicing speedrunning it. Definitally one of my favorite releases 2019. The devolopers are awesome and listen to their fans and listen to feedback. They're quick to fix bugs and work with people to deliver what people want or fix things they're not happy with.,Recommended
"If you have ever played any Metriodvania game and liked it, this game is a must buy. This takes everything I liked about classics such as Castlevania: Symphony of the Night, and puts into a new, fresh IP that doesn't disappoint. The shard mechanic is also a nice way to encourage player experimentation, by making it so (some) powers are locked behind drops from enemies.\n\nIn short, if you liked Castlevania: SotN or games like Hollow Knight, I couldn't recommend this game more.",Recommended
"I played symphony of the night once long ago, this is like that. Good game.",Recommended
Great game that doesn't bother holding your hand.,Recommended
Great game.,Recommended
"loved it, just SOTN but better gfx and map",Recommended
So after putting a few hours in. I can say for me it was worth the wait. Been having a ton of fun playing it and is just like Igas old CastleVainia games. If you love those games give this game a shot it great and a lot of fun.,Recommended
Love it,Recommended
"best metroidvania thats come out so far in recent time.\n\nget it, its amazing, you wont regret it <3",Recommended
"More Igavania is a good thing. Some of the progression is slightly obtuse, and could use a few general pointers in a direction.",Recommended
Nice game.,Recommended
SOTN 2.0,Recommended
Good.,Recommended
"Pretty good game, the hour I've been into gave me the feeling I was playing one of the old Castlevania games, from sound track to gameplay, very recommended if you are into Metroidvania genre, I doubt you will regret it.",Recommended
"It's very good.  If you enjoyed SotN you should enjoy this also.\n\nThe amount of shards and weaponry is kind of overwhelming because most of them seem useful, and that's fine with me.  I think it's balanced pretty well, considering.",Recommended
"Bosses require more skill and technique than the Castlevania bosses.\nArt style is really good. Takes all the good mechanics from SOTN, AoS, DoS, Order of Ecclesia, and makes it into a single game.\nYou have familiars like SOTN. Equipment and RPG stats like SOTN. All the accessory items in the game actually appear on the character, so do the hats. Only equipment you that doesn't change aesthetics are armors/chestpieces. \n\nYou can craft food from recipes. Food gives you more HP back than potions. \n\nYou have the soul system from Dawn/Aria/Order where you have a chance to get an enemy's soul as a drop to be used as a MP weapon (called shards in this).  These can be upgraded by obtaining more of the same shard, or by crafting upgrades via parts. This can give them new properties and make them more powerful.\n\nHighly recommended.",Recommended
"Bloodstained: Ritual of The Night is a love letter to Castlevania fans.\n\nBeautiful graphics, huge map to explore and a bunch of different weapon types and shards to use, you can mix and match any way you want to find your preferred way of playing, and with the Shortcut system to change builds quickly you can do a lot of fun stuff.\n\nThere are still two characters to come and many other updates.",Recommended
Totally worth the wait and can't wait for more in this IP.  Loved the style of the promotion as well.\n\nLooking for a game like symphony of the night but with a not-quite the same IP?  This is it and more.,Recommended
"If you loved old Castlevania games like Aria of Sorrow, you will love this game.",Recommended

"Must say i did nothing less than love it, i think it might have been a bit to short and i'd love to see expansions adding upon it to make it a larger and bigger game. but other than that it's pretty much been the Metroidvania 2D platformer i've been waiting for",Recommended
"Fantastic metroidvania, reminds me of SOTN which is why i fell in love with these types of games. Fluid controls, tough bosses, lots of weapons to change play style. Issue with game crashing due to some bugs. Not a dealbreaker but certainly annoying. overall fantastic game any mertroidvania fan would enjoy",Recommended

It's like Castlevania without Castlevania.,Recommended
Ah.. back to my childhood.,Recommended
A great addition to the metroidvanina games.,Recommended
"As an avid metroidvana/igavania player, I approve of B:ROTN. It's a great homage to SOTN. \nI do hope there are some quality of life improvements. I'll list them soon, but these items should not deter a player from enjoying the game. \n9/10.",Recommended
"It definitely radiates Castlevania Symphony of the Night and Aria of Sorrow. It takes inspiration from two of the best metroidvania games. It's a bit wonky with clipping issues and a little lack of polish however.\n\n\nI recommend going with one of the harder difficulty options, it is trivially easy to find an overpowered ability and mow down the big enemies and bosses with.\nYou can stock up on potions, pause and heal during battle. So the difficulty has to be controlled by self-imposed rules if you want a real challenge, like never healing during bosses or something like that.\n\nI can still wholeheartedly recommend it for fans starving for more Igavania as it ticks almost all the boxes.",Recommended
Good Game.,Recommended
It's really the perfect thing for anyone who loved SOTN or the Castlevanias on GBA or DS.  Fabulous OST too!,Recommended
"If you like any of the IGAvania games, you'll like this. For better or worse, it's almost identical to them with some minor improvements.",Recommended
"This game is by far one of the best 2.5D Metrovania platformer. And the fact that it is done by the creator of Castlevania makes this even better. There are a lot of Pros that I can't stress enough. However, there are few minor nickpick I have to point out.\nPro:\n- The visuals are great. The fact that it is Unreal Engine 4 and can be run by my crappy laptop without lagging is astounding.\n- Combat is well balanced as you can learn the enemy pattern and eventually perfectly kill them\n- The control is well optimized so that you can use either controller or Keyboard and Mouse is a great addition.\nCons:\n- The side-quests, except the kill ones, can be quite tedious at times. Especially the cooking one as there are times I have to run back and forth between the Shop and Crafting just to get the ingredients and then make the food. The only thing I am glad about is that whatever you crafted before becomes unlocked in the Shop.\n- The animation you are FORCED to see every time you get a new Shard is quite annoying, especially when you are lucky enough to get a lot of new ones. Oh my goodness Miriam's scream is still echoing in my head.\n- The drop rates are below 2 digits and while it is possible to get extremely lucky to get a lot of new ones in a new area, some of the more useful ones can get really annoying to get, to the point of occasionally grinding for them.\n- The story is mediocre at best, but it's just quite a small issue since it does give us an interesting glimpse of the world of Bloodstained. Though should I mention that the story is awfully similar to Castlevania: Order of Ecclesia?\nOverall, this is a must play game if you like Castlevania or Metrovania in general. I give this game my 8/10 rating.",Recommended

"I bought the game after hearing the good reviews. Beforehand, I was not happy with how it looked, and expected it to be another kickstarter flop. Thankfully I can say I was wrong. Even after release screenshots of the game proved to look poor, however, there are only a couple of instances in game (the very beginning for example) where the art style stands out in a bad way. The gameplay feels like classic metroidvania and exceeds at replication the feel. One of the biggest issues with the game is the difficulty. On normal, I had difficulty with the second boss, and the final boss, whilst all the other bosses felt relatively easy whilst spamming DPS. The final boss I legitimately felt I was missing a key mechanic, as there is a message brought up earlier in the game, and when facing him with what I believe to be best armor, weapon, and max potion, they did not go down after a lengthy fight. Fortunately after finding out I was wrong, I just needed to change up the loadout\n\nOverall this is a solid entry. £30 seems a good price but with the bounty of excellent indie platformers at half the price, it's hard to recommend at full price. If you catch it on sale, it's a fun time.",Recommended
A Worthy successor to the Masterpiece that is Symphony of the Night.  The controls are spot on the Map is a blast to explore the music and backgrounds are wonderful and help bring the player into the game.  This is the SOTN sequel we have all been waiting for. \n\nExcellent job IGA and Team !!,Recommended
"After backing the original Kickstarter, I'm so glad I finally have this game in my hands to play. And after 50 hours grinding and collecting, I beat the game, but am nowhere near done playing. It's essentially SOTN 2. And I feel like there's nothing wrong with that. Collecting shards, items for crafting, and level grinding were all enjoyable. Maybe too enjoyable because I seriously over leveled my character and beat the last two bosses in about 2 minutes. Probably my only complaint is that the game is a little too easy, but that is easily rectifiable because other difficulties open up after beating the Recommended Ending of the game. Any other complaint I have would be just QOL fixes and the positives of this game far out weigh the negatives. Highly recommend if you miss the good old days of classic MetroidVania's.",Recommended
"Great game, maybe a little on the easy side. I'm always a fan of games that give you a wide variety of weapons to attack with. A lot of the shards are awesome and fun to work with (Buer is the best Familiar and Summon, don't @ me). Weapon techniques feel a little unresponsive on getting them to work, but it's not like they are all that important or useful. The game is also a little buggy. I've had it freeze up several times while talking to NPCs. Something to do with me skipping their dialogue too fast, I think. Overall, the game is definitely worth it if you are a fan of Castlevania! Or even if you aren't, like me!",Recommended
I love this game.,Recommended
"A fulfilling explorative experience in the classic Symphony of the Night style, with more than enough secrets, endgame content, and Jojo's Bizarre Adventure references to keep it fun until the last drop.",Recommended

"A faithful nod to Castlevannia with fantastic pacing and implementation of more modern gameplay systems.

A QUALITY Metroidvania experience for the modern year.",Recommended
"The wait was definitely worth it, and it brought one of the most fun games I have played in ages. Iga is back with a new metroidvania that doesn't disappoint.

Hopefully these bugs get squashed because I'm liking the game a lot so far otherwise.",Recommended
"Is gud, food overpowered",Recommended
"Bought this having never played a Castlevania game before... I blame the cute cover girl. Playing on normal after the first boss to which I died a few times while getting used to the game, and the second boss which took me a few tries to get through... Everything after until where I am now was a breeze with my only deaths being due to my poor platforming skills\n\nMy point? Even if you're not used to Metroidvania games you can still enjoy Bloodstained\n\nPositives... \n(1) A good introduction to the Metroidvania genre\n(2) Many different weapon kinds with unique animations and effect\n(3) The game looks beautiful with its backgrounds and enemy variety\n(4) Customisable main character with more customisation options unlocked as you progress\n(5) Each enemy in the game has a chance to drop a spell, these range from having said enemy as a follower, to targeted spells, to a spell that turns your character into a bunny girl\n\nNegatives...\n(1) Veterans of the genre might find the game to be too easy\n(2) Some areas have this strange 2D but you're going around a 3D area feel resulting in having no idea where you're going \n(3) ""Fights are clumsy brawls where you just exchange health with opponents until one of you dies"" - Kotaku :NicoSmug:\n(4) The first boss slapped me with a tentacle\n(5) Forced to battle and kill a vampire waifu to progress through the game",Recommended

"I've been a metroidvania fan since, well, since Symphony of the Night. And while I love the ""modern"" takes on metroidvanias, be it Hollow Knight or Ori or Dead Cells or, well, whatever, sometimes what you want isn't a breath of fresh air.\n\nSometimes what you want is just plain old classic\n\nBloodstained is exactly that. Bloodstained is a nostalgic trip down memory lane, to a formula that has never - to me at least - stopped working. It's the grand gothic castle with a dude in it that only you can stop, and for that you're going to use a plethora of swords, daggers, whips, magic, and a lot of ragequits when that boss kicks your ass once more. (Writing this review right after the first encounter with Z, and, well, that was painful.)\n\nRating it nostalgia out of ten :)",Recommended

"For better or for worse, this is the return of Recommended Igavania, as you remember it, in 2019.\n\nI'm a different person than I was in those days, and the idea of grinding the same screen over and over again to farm an item isnt something that appeals to me any more. And it's pretty clear they were running out of budget by the end of the game as the last few sections are just pure ass, both visually and from a game design perspective.\n\nBut hey, it's legit Igavania, in 2019. For a certain breed of gamer, thats all you need to hear.",Recommended
Ever wanted to try out a Castlevania-like game? Now is the time with this game!\nOne of the best looking games of its kind and with a great soundtrack.\nTotally worth the price and there are even free DLC coming in the future.,Recommended
Reminiscent of Castlevania: Symphony of the Night to a high degree with some tweaks like reversing the castle being an in-game ability and most of the overpowered gear favorites being available early on rather than a second playthrough.  It's highly responsive and easy to farm loot and 100% the game and achievements due to quality of life improvements to drop rates and exploration over older metroidvanias.  Plenty of references indicate this is a love letter to classics and the anime influence suggests it's not meant to be taken all that seriously.  If you enjoy the Castlevania series and are looking for a new one then this will scratch that itch and if you're new to the metroidvania genre then this will offer a kinder experience than similar games like Hollow Knight.,Recommended
"The good:\n[*] Great soundtrack.\n[*] Fluid gameplay that reminds you of the DSvanias and SoTN.\n[*] Many unique bossfights.\n[*] A lot of content.\n\nThe bad:\n[*] The game has some ""interesting"" design ideas and halts your progress at some points.\n[*] Your character feels a bit too floaty at times.",Recommended
"After numerous delays and painstaking waiting, Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night delivers a satisfying and replayable experience.

"While I was skeptical initially, after a few hours I really started to appreciate the game. It may not be beautiful and it's a technical mess (especially on 21:9 displays), but the metroidvania gameplay is fantastic.\n\nThere are so many different complex systems in the game. Countless weapons that really let you choose your own play style, so many different active and passive abilities, attack combos, a crafting system, an RPG stats system, a food system for one-time bonuses and more. The map design is great, even if many rooms are very basic. But the way those rooms are combined and how you constantly open up new areas through newly acquired abilities is really enjoyable.\n\nSometimes the thing you need to do to progress is definitely too obscured. Games like Ori did a way better job at this. In fact I could list quite a few small annoyances here. It's not a perfect game by any means. But what counts is the overall enjoyment you get out of this game. And I can say with confidence if you like metroidvania games you will have a lot of fun with this one.\n\nIt took me a good 20 hours to beat the game. Completion will take a lot longer, if you're into that.",Recommended

"|Spoiler Free Review|\n\nTL:DR\n\n8.5/10 buy this NOW!\n\n+ Art Direction is superb. Hauntingly beautiful, varied and unique character and level designs. Worthy of an award. \n+ Gameplay is nostalgic, yet refreshing. Its the same Iga goodness, but elevated to a higher level. \n+ Map design is astonishing. Many secrets and treasures can be found behind the castle's walls. Will you be able to find them all? \n+ Voice cast is amazing. Erica Lindbeck, David Hayter, Benjamin Diskin, and even SOTN's Robert Belgrade and the rest of the voice cast entice you and bring their characters to life. \n+ Igavania done at it's finest. Truly a masterclass of Igarashi's talents as a game designer. Can't wait to see what he does next. \n\n\n* Difficulty curve gets much easier as you go naturally grind and progress. Wish there was a higher difficulty than Nightmare. Maybe a DMC-esque Hell or Hell mode where you die in one hit? \n* Grinding. I love it, its fun. Many people I know hate the grind and would rather skip it. Not for people who hate grinding. \n* Story can be a little confusing at times. There is a great need to infer may events which have happened prior to the game. I am not sure if the prequel game; Curse of the Moon has it. Maybe I need to play that one?\n* Balancing of weapon types. I have found that some weapon types are vastly superior to others, not by stats, but by design. it can be overlooked as it just forces you to change the way that you play, but i wish it incentivised you to play around with the different weapons instead of finding an insanely OP build.  \n\n- Minor bugs in the game are still present. Nothing too major, but numerous enough that I've gotten annoyed by them.\n\n\n|Long Review Starts Here| \n\nBloodstained: Ritual of the Night is one of the best games that I have ever played. It is truly a masterclass on how the Metroidvania can be done, standing alongside other heavyweights in the genre like Castlevania: Symphony of the Night and Hollow Knight. Bloodstained has the potential to exceed them. This review serves as a guidepost to help inform you if you should purchase this game or not. \n\n-Story- \n\nBloodstained puts you into the boots of waifu *ahem* Shardbinder Miriam. Shardbinders are humans that have been implanted with Shards, the physical manifestations of demonic energy, to combat demons themselves. Having woken from a 10 year slumber, Miriam is tasked with stopping Gebel, a Shardbinder whose massive intake of shards has corrupted him from summoning the Demon King Bael into the mortal plane and killing everything. From there the story is quite straightforward. As you progress in the story, you can find bookshelves which contain a little backstory to help supplement the main story. I've found however that characters make reference to events in such a way that we are supposed to know that they happened. Either I'm missing something, or its not clearly explained. Having not played the prequel game Bloodstained: Curse of the Moon, it might just be the first one. Otherwise, it is a pretty standard story. \n\n-Gameplay: Combat-\n\nThe real meat and bones of any Metroidvania is the gameplay. Igarashi makes use of his signature Metroidvania gameplay and elevates it to a much higher level than what I've seen before. Because there is so much to cover, I'll split it into 3 main parts: Combat, Exploration, and RPG elements. \n\nThe combat in this game is quite varied. There are several weapon types for you to choose from, ranging from boots, daggers, swords, spears, greatswords, katanas, and even guns. Each weapon type has its own range, damage in relation to other weapon types, speed, and angled hitbox (for example, greatswords have more damage and range than swords, but it is much slower and can leave you open to attacks.) Each weapon type forces you to change your play style to maximize its efficiency. My personal favorite are guns. They have a limited pool of ammunition with differing levels of power and effects. It has the longest range of all weapon types, but forces you to be careful and mindful of your surroundings and ammo. If you run out of ammo, you get switched to an unlimited ammo type, which is much weaker in relation to other ammunition. \n\nCombat is your standard  press the attack button until your opponents die, but with an added twist. Remember those bookshelves that I mentioned earlier? Aside from backstory, they also contain weapon techniques. These techniques are different moves that you can execute with a ""fighting game-esque"" command that is different from your standard attack. These are all split into the different weapon types, but some techniques are limited to a specific weapon or weapons. Mastering a technique allows you to use it with all weapons that share a weapon type. \n\n-Gameplay: Exploration-    \n\nBloodstained wouldn't be a proper Metroidvania without a large map to explore. The game devs really hit it out of the park with this one. As with each Metroidvania, your movement options are limited, as such, it is impossible to reach every single part of the castle without first gaining ways to improve your movement or manipulate the map to your whim. The excitement that I felt when getting such an ability was SKY HIGH! It really makes you think of the places that you've been in and where your powers can apply. It genuinely surprised me to see where you could go and how you could get there. At the end of the game, four movement options in particular made traversing the castle so fun and fast, that i wish they were there sooner. The map itself is huge, so there are a lot of secrets to find, including upgrades to ammo, health, mana, and even recipes to food and gear, which I'll talk about in the next section. \n\n-Gameplay: RPG Elements-\n\nTaking a cue from SOTN, Bloodstained has a few RPG elements to consider. From stats to crafting, this game does it well. Miriams stats are much of the standard fare, including ATK, or how much damage you do, STR which boosts your weapon damage, INT which boosts magic damage, CON which boosts your resistance to physical damage, MND which boosts your resistance to magical attacks, and my favorite, LCK, which boosts the likelihood of drops and critical hits. These will naturally go up as you level up, but there are pieces of gear that you can equip which boosts these stats as well. Choosing the right pieces of gear to suit your build is one of the most important things in this game. It spells the difference between life and death. These stats can also be improved by consuming food. Food can give you a HP or MP boost, but when consuming it for the first time, it gives you a permanent boost to a specific stat. \n\nGear and food can be crafted using various ingredients that can be found throughout the game world. The higher level gear requires higher level materials that you can usually only get in the endgame. This means that it is really only super useful in an NG+. Not all gear can be crafted right away, with you having to explore the castle to find various recipes to build them. \n\nAs a Shardbinder, Miriam can absorb the Shards of defeated enemies. These come in 6 types, all do different things. These shards can be upgraded too, but it is a little different than gear and food. It is split between Rank and Grade. Increased ranks increase the effects of the Shard, while Grade makes the shard more powerful. Rank can be be increased by infusing materials into the shard, while Grade is increased by obtaining the same shard. Mix and match different shards to your playstyle. \n\n-Art Direction-\n\nThroughout its four year development cycle, there was a lot of flak on the devs to fix their art style. I am happy to say now that the art is stunning. The colors are vibrant and haunting, and the textures are fixed. Made on the Unreal Engine, the character models and backgrounds look absolutely stunning. It truly immerses you in the world of Bloodstained and in the characters. The devs deserve praise. \n\nBuy it     \n           \n",Recommended

"A wonderful Recommended to it's style vania style game, made by the same creator!\nThe style and the atmosphere are astounding, the gameplay smooth and simple. You feel more powerful as the game goes on, and your skills get more diverse or powerful.\nThere's a few bugs that can be minor, and a couple I've seen that are quite bothersome. Item's getting stuck in the ground (Annoying when it's a rare drop), or even freezing the character when a specific thing happens. However, they are patching up bugs as the game is live. \n\nTL;DR: If you love Castlevania 2D Adventure games, this is the game for you. If you're new to 2D adventures, this is a great starting point with very few dead stops. \n\n9/10 from me.",Recommended
"This game is fucking amazing. I've only just gotten past the first boss, and I can without a doubt say I can't remember the last time I've had this much fun with a single player game. The voice acting is awesome, the soundtrack is spectacular, and the gameplay is responsive and fluid. There's multiple difficulty levels too, so there's easy mode for beginners and a hellish mode for those wanting to test their skills. Definitely gonna dump a lot of time into this game. Oh, and Miriam is hot as fuck and she can sit on my face.",Recommended
Its a very good game and one i plan on doing more of,Recommended
"It was definitely worth it. I wasnt a backer or anything and got it on a whim the day or 2 before it came out when I had realized it was about to release. Its SOTN with a touch of Aria, Dawn and Eccelsia and with a slightly different presentation. Its been a long while since a Castlevania came out, much less one like this so it was good to see this sort of game again. The free DLCs havent come out yet either so theres still more to come as well. Very nice buy overall.",Recommended

The Castlevania game I've been waiting for since Aria of Sorrow,Recommended
"In simplest terms: If you liked any of the Castlevania games from Symphony of the Night onwards, you will like Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night.\n\nIt's not perfect. In order to unlock about half of the game, you have to do something stupid that the game does nothing to indicate to you. The final area is kind of lackluster and bland. Most of the shards are kind of weak until you upgrade or level them.\n\nThat said? Every other part of the game is a 10/10 at least. The weapon types all feel useful and strong. The movement abilities are interesting. Hitting enemies feels good. Exploring the map and hunting down secrets is rewarding. Fighting bosses is challenging. The game isn't afraid to let you get overpowered if you want to put in the work. The story has clearly had careful thought put into it. Fun quirks and interesting mechanics lurk around every corner. It's packed with content without being bloated. In summary, it's a game that's both carefully crafted and full of soul. (Or glyphs, if you're an OoE type of person.)\n\nThere is exactly one potential issue that I would consider if you're thinking about purchasing this game. The game does follow in its spiritual predecessor's footsteps very closely. If you want something that feels more like an evolution on the mechanics, Ritual of the Night doesn't shake up the formula a whole lot. Go play Hollow Knight, that's a Metroidvania-style game that shakes things up a bit more. But if you want a game that feels like Aria of Sorrow 2, then this is exactly what you're looking for.\n\nFor those of you who aren't already on the Castlevania bandwagon, Bloodstained is... a lot of things. It's got platforming, it's got action, it's got RPG mechanics, it's got adventure, it's got crafting and most importantly of all, it's got blood. Like, lots of blood. Gore aside, the primary aesthetic that the game reinforces is exploration. You kill enemies to get abilities to unlock more of the castle. You craft equipment to more easily explore the map. You jump and run around to find new areas. Much like this paragraph focuses on reiterating that the core theme is exploration, the game focuses on exploration almost in its entirety.\n\nUltimately, I recommend the game whole-heartedly. Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night does what it sets out to do with flying colors. Moreover, it's fun, it's challenging, and it's rewarding. What else can you ask of a game?",Recommended
A real tribute to Castlevania Symphony of the Night.,Recommended
Quality game. Progression and flow of the game feels rewarding. The backdash canceling feels fluid and rewarding. Nothing feels forced and there is plenty to explore allowing you to create the gameplay experience you want with the weapons/items you want to build around.,Recommended
"Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night is one of the most content-rich and engaging metroidvanias I've played in a long time. While there are times when the game gets a bit slowed down by grinding, there's such a great variety of weapons, abilities, and places to explore that it feels like I'm constantly finding new things to do. The controls are tight, music is stellar, and I found a cowboy hat a few minutes in.\n\nIt's a great game.",Recommended

Several options of how to play your character; from melee heavy, to ranged casting and firearms. Fantastic soundtrack. Hits all the nostalgia buttons.\n\nCONS: If I have to list any: most of the bosses are a little easy on normal difficulty, especially if you took the time to top off your gear and/or took some time leveling - but, that's not really different from any other game with gears and levels. Only other thing, it can get a little grindy if you've really gotta have that special item/ability - but it never felt like it was required for progress at any point.",Recommended

The controls are fast and responsive, everything runs cleanly, and it's done exactly in the Castlevania spirit.\n\nSupport this now, we need more of this.",Recommended
I'd recommend this to anyone who enjoyed SOTN,Recommended
"If you're a fan of Castlevania then you'll love Bloodstained.\nMost people compare it to Symphony of the Night and while that is a fair comparison, I feel like Bloodstained is a bit more similar to Aria of Sorrow and Dawn of Sorrow, two other great Castlevania titles.",Recommended
"I decided to pick up this game and play it blind after hearing good things about it from a streamer I regularly follow. I didn't get to watch said stream due to IRL.\n\nIt was an interesting experience. I liked the concept, though I think this game could have used a little more open world exploration, instead of it basically being ""Item X directly leads to the next progression item when you're done exploring everything else (That can be unlocked with your current equipment.). I would have liked to see something where you could collect any one of several progression items, but you need all of them in order to progress past a certain point. Also while most of what you need is pretty well detailed in the sense of guiding you where you need to go, there are a few items that you don't get much hint about, and are absolutely necessary if you want to complete the game (and get the best ending). \n\nI did get stuck a few times and wound up consulting a guide - but only when I couldn't figure out what to do next, and exited the guide once I was unstuck.\n\nI also died a quite few times, mostly to a few bosses (And in the lava zone, screw that place). Also, the Recommended final boss was a worthy opponent, if a bit of a case of ""How much HP does this thing have, anyways?"" which caused some deaths when I ran out of healing items.  Also on that note, our hero moves like a freaking tank for most of the game, and it isn't until you're a fair chunk of the way into the game before you can do anything about the clunky movement speed. (Thankfully by the end, you can zip around all over the place, which made cleaning things up much easier)\n\nOverall though, I'd say give this game a try if you like the concept of metroidvanias. And the usual ""Buy it on sale"" rule applies if you're still on the fence about it.",Recommended

There's a new game + mode available after beating it once, 3 difficulties, and boss rush, with co op and extra playable characters coming in later updates.\n\nIf you like Metroidvania type games, getting this game is a no brainer.

"Undoubtedly the discussion of Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night will always bring to mind the existence of Castlevania: Symphony of the Night, and for good reason. Bloodstained, produced by Koji Igarashi, is the spiritual successor to Symphony is the Night in every way. From a demon infested castle to a vampire-like entity acting as ruler to a power up that is literally flipping the castle, Bloodstained owes much of its mechanics and game play to that of Symphony of the Night. For Bloodstained to be compared to Symphony of the Night, a game in which part of the term Metroidvania originates from, is to do a disservice to Bloodstained. No game could hold up to the lofty expectations that Symphony of the Night has left behind. A revolutionary game, Symphony of the Night has spawned more than half a dozen sequels and a bevy of Metroidvania indies and set the ground work for the existence of interconnected world maps, branching pathways, and powerful weapons.\n\nBloodstained is no different than many other Metroidvania games. An interconnected world map is at your disposable. Multiple branching pathways exist for you to travel down and uncover new surprises and mysteries. And progression is marked by new tools and powerful weapons that help you to combat the demons and monsters the world of Bloodstained throws at you. All things considered, Bloodstained is Symphony of the Night with a new coat of paint splashed on for the 21st century. Yet despite treading on the same beaten path Bloodstained still continues to wow and impress 25 hours in.\n\nStory wise, the game initially passes itself off as that of Symphony of the Night. You are Miriam, a shard bender and one of two left in the world. In a coma for the past 10 years, Miriam wakes up to find the world being overrun by a demonic horde led by the shard bender Gebel. Assisted by the Alchemist Johannes, the Exorcist Dominique, and the Demon Hunter Zangetsu, Miriam travels throughout the castle to end Gebel’s reign and to fulfill the promise she once made him many years ago. Yet despite the obvious parallels to Alucard and Dracula the story takes a dramatic eleventh hour twist that reshapes the relationship between Miriam and the cast of characters she called friends and enemies.\n\nAnd while the story is nothing to write home about, the voice acting is some of the best indie gaming has to offer. Erica Lindbeck captures the pain of each shard Miriam absorbs and prideful nature she expresses towards others. David Hayter displayed the ever gruff nature of his characters as Zangetsu quietly complies with the groups goals. Igarashi even enlists the help of a familiar voice actor for one particular librarian that is both a nostalgic blast and a welcome sight.\n\nGame play, much like Symphony of the Night, is top notch for the genre. Miriam has access to a variety of weapons and spells at her disposal in order to combat the demons of the castle. From whips to boots to shorts to knives and more, Miriam uses many weapons in her arsenal that helps keep the game play fresh and inventive. There are many weapons that also hearken back to that of Symphony of the Night such as the Rheva Velar or Bandit knife. Spells also make a return in the form of shards. Shards act as the soul of the enemy in which Miriam can evoke powerful elemental attacks, summon various familiars, alter castle landscapes, and blast rooms with gigantic AOE spells. While initially weak, Miriam gradually becomes a powerhouse of strength and speed as more spells and weapons are availed to her. By the end of 25 hours of game play Miriam was destroying anything and everything in sight, even on hard mode.\n\nVarious locales litter the world of Bloodstained and while many are winners such as the glacial tomb some can be underwhelming and outright bad. A major problem many Metroidvania games can’t seem to get around is directing a player down a particular path. While that is a staple of Metroidvania games, it also serves to hinder progression as players stumble along trying to find the next tool or weapon for progression. Not only does Bloodstained gate content behind shard powers and tools, but one particular section has you traverse a body of water without ever telling you how to dive into the water. Stumbling around the castle, I accidentally ran into the bad ending before I figured out that one particular enemy had a shard to dive into the water. It would be nice if the game somehow expressed that the shard to travel in water is given by that same enemy in the water. It isn’t intuitive because during the first encounter I thought that I would have to be equipped with a swimming shard in the first place to fight that enemy.\n\nYet despite the convoluted nature of Metroidvania games as a whole, Bloodstained frequently amazes with its rich locales and sprawling environments. From the Japanese inspired Oriental Sorcery Lab to the gilded Dian Chet Cathedral to the enormous nature of Den of Behemoths, each zone feels unique both in atmosphere and in game play. Den of Behemoths in particular has you fighting enemies you had been fighting previously yet blown up to ridiculous sizes forcing the player to use all the movement options available to traverse the large open spaces of combat.\n\nBloodstained is not short on secrets and easter eggs either. The team at ArtPlay has packed this game to the brim with secrets. Befitting Metroidvania games, Bloodstained has you checking every walls for cracks and bashing every nook and cranny for goodies. While you won’t find any ham laid in these castle walls you will find various health boosting power ups, mana boosting power ups, and capacity boosting effects for the various guns used by Miriam. And once in awhile a secret room may yield some unexpected easter eggs. In particular, a room dedicated to another hit indie is present in this game. And another room dedicates itself to that of the classic 8-bit era of gaming to an extreme.\n\nLooking at the game design of Bloodstained it is clear that Igarashi wanted to make something similar to Symphony of the Night yet unique for the modern era of gaming. The game uses a 2D plane of movement yet renders all of its models, graphics, and characters in a 3D style, as a result dubbed a 2.5D style. While initially this style may be off putting and distracting it comes together in environments where the style is meant to shine. The Glacial Tomb is one such environment where the background is littered with frozen demons that help to contrast Miriam’s struggles with the demons roaming about.\n\nThe music also calls back to that of old with designer Michiru Yamane composing most of the game’s soundtrack. From intense guitar riffs to somber piano solos, it is clear Yamane is evoking the music of Castlevania in that of Bloodstained. The quality of music, much like the environment, varies depending on locale and player action. None of the music was particularly bad however actual memorable music can be hard to come by save for one particular solo by a particular pixie friend.\n\nBloodstained clearly has been made with Symphony of the Night in mind. Thinking back this game should not be the success that it is. Mighty No. 9 had shown people that using nostalgia as a selling point does not make a great game. And all signs in early access had shown a poorly optimized and awful looking product.\n\nIn spite of the various failed products that Kickstarter has produced and this game had seemed to trend towards, Bloodstained is a marvel of the modern Metroidvania world. With some of the best gameplay Metroidvania games have to offer combined with the atmosphere and design of an Igarashi game, Bloodstained stands as a triumph in indie gaming and one many will look back on with fondness. Men may be a miserable pile of secrets, but Bloodstained is a joyous mountain of goodies.\n\nScore: 8.5/10",Recommended

"Absolutly fantastic, well I would say Metriodvania, but in all reality it's very much Castlevania, no need for the Metriod part of the genre. Only two things I dislike so far about the game so far, first being that the first two bosses if you don't know what you are doing yet are pretty tough on your first play (much easier once you know what your doing) to the point where I had to look up what I was missing about the fights to not get killed, other thing is you can easily accidently walk into the ""final"" boss way to early while trying to find the next actual boss and get the bad ending not even meaning to., there is nothing to indicate that room is ""the boss"" and not just ""a boss"". Other then that the mechanics all feel good, the way skills have ranks and grades that you can level up is good, and at no point did the platforming feel annoying. All in all this game makes me want to finish it and then go back and play all the old 2D Castlevania games.",Recommended

"Disclaimer: I'm a Kickstarter Backer for Bloodstained: RotN (Alchemist Treasure - PC and Switch). This review is for the PC version and not the Switch version.\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Good:\n- Fun metroidvania gameplay.\n- Exploration is fateful to the Castlevania series. Yeah, backtracking is still a thing!\n- The game's environment and background is very pretty despite being 2.5D. Somehow it really works. \n- Lots of easter eggs and references to Castlevania. If you played Symphony of the Night, Aria of Sorrow, Dawn of Sorrow, Portrait of Ruin and Order of Ecclesia, you're in for a treat.\n- Crafting system is user-friendly and easy to understand. \n- The story is coherent and easy to follow. The story is good but not groundbreaking.\n- Major improvement compared the Beta version. The differences is night and day. The current iteration of the game is much more beautiful. \n\n\nThe Bad:\n- FPS drops at certain areas\n- There are some bugs and sometimes it can crash your game (Yes, I'm talking to you, headless Miriam!).\n- The backtracking can be a little tedious. Some items and weapons you get from backtracking may be useless and weaker than the ones you currently have.\n- Some extra modes we have to wait for. Come on, I want to play Zangetsu Mode\n\nVerdict: I recommend this game. Iga made a fantastic game. It's masterpiece but has some flaws. Hopefully the patches will fix the bugs and add the rest of the content. The wait is real but when it comes, it's worth the wait.",Recommended

"Mr. Belmondo would be proud.\n\nOver the last decade the ""splinter team of old devs promise a spiritual successor to something they worked on"" game has gained a lot of notoriety as a concept and gone so far as to be a large reason why some people dislike the idea of crowd funding video games anymore. The simple fact of the matter we've had to come to face is that a lot of games are a product of countless little factors: scarcely any game is truly great because of just one individual and their inclusion alone can't make or break a product 100% of the time. We've felt burned for our naive nature in thinking good games were the product of throwing money at the people who are in the end credits of our favorite games and rightfully so, the bitter taste of Mighty Number Nine and Yooka-Laylee still in my mouth.\n\nBloodstained, by all means was in every way the same at first: a neat, kitschy little ARG to build hype, a major influential figure from the original games acting as leader for the project, a touted all-star cast of people who you don't actually know but they have credentials and a ton of promised rewards and little games along the way.\n\nNow here's the rub: Igarashi screwed up massively and has let his team, forgetting they were making a Kickstarter game, produce a downright outstanding title that has made my wistful longing for a new Igavania title turn into wistful longing for an equally great sequel to this piece. Somehow over the four years of development Bloodstained has kept free of major dramas, development hell, they even listened to criticisms when they released an early alpha demo and the results feel so much like if Castlevania as an IP was still getting pushed forward today instead of being milked and turned into crap mobile games I almost feel guilty knowing that near every other review must be saying the same about it.\n\nThere's no denying that Bloodstained has the DNA, heart and soul of the games that came before it and use that knowledge to make itself as good a product as it can. There's plenty of world lore to sink your teeth into as the game attempts to establish a new mythos that's close enough to capture the feeling of Castlevania while being unique yet doesn't bash you over the head with exposition and forced dialogue. I was actually a little shocked at how fast I was able to begin running around, kicking in monster's faces, learning the controls on my own and figuring out the latest modular power system. The Shard system feels like a great progression over Soma's and Shanoa's powers in the previous games, boasting five categories of abilities that all feel useful: no longer do you need to choose between a short or mid-range projectile or a passive stat boost and a familiar, rather you're expected to have all four equipped at once and it makes for a greater feeling of customization that made it so encountering a monster came with the excitement of wondering what powers it could confer to Miriam.\n\nThe breadth of equipment follows suit as it has a nice quartet of armor slots, two being the very flexible ""misc"" slot are used and I could never quite find a single objective best loadout for Miriam so much as items that were better at a particular playstyle. Weapons are varied and come with both their own sets of simple properties and attacks and unique fighting game-style inputs that mean that even if you don't like to rely on Shards you have options to expend MP for things like rapid fire mode, huge all-out strikes or precise counters, to name a few. When coupled with the shard system and how it invokes the old loadout preset system while letting you work up to over a half dozen fully unique, saved, named presets meant I'd spent stretches of time just enjoying the experience of making loadouts and switching between them on the fly, stuff like pairing a gun with an anti-melee barrier or my mobility tools with a familiar Miriam could bounce off of with a midair kick to reach higher places and seeing those things work felt like I was rewarded for spending that time too.\n\nOf course the atmosphere is decidedly that of an Igavania too: there's a delightful mix of somber, atmospheric tones, shock and horror, and then delightfully hokey and ridiculous elements, enemies that actually made me laugh upon coming across them for the first time and such things as being able to pose on command. I don't want to spoil it for those interested so I'll just say that the absurdity of fighting demonic french maids and Jojo references while fighting a knife-throwing, time-stopping monster as in the old games is absolutely invoked here in full force.\n\nIn summary I think that we've grown weary as a whole and culture of people promising they can give us a game that'll reawaken how we felt when we first played some other game: it takes lightning in a bottle to make happen, a dedicated team with lots of attentive people keeping it running all whom know how to make a good product, the original might not even be as good as we remember and we're looking to something that can basically outdo the old due to not having rose tinted glasses to help. Somehow though Bloodstained prevails and time and time again I've been shocked by how I love it in all the ways I did playing Dawn of Sorrow for the first time and even more. You can stay in this evening for pleasure, Iga's still got it.",Recommended

Easily the best metroidvania I've played since SoTN,Recommended
Very nice game 10/10,Recommended
"TLDR : A competent game, both a good metroidvania and Igavania, but somewhat hindered by (some gamebreaking) bugs, and a bit of a lack of polish.\n\nLet's start with the compliments : \n\n-Miriam (your character) controls really well, and the combat is pretty well done. Some of the later boss fights against human-sized opponents can be quite enjoyable while trying to get their medal (which requires beating them without taking a single hit).\n\n-The shards (functionally identical to souls in the Sorrow games, drops from enemies which can be equipped to grant new abilities, both active and passives) are quite varied and well done. Of course some are better than others, but this is normal for this type of game. There is a great variety of builds and playstyles to experiment with.\n\n-The music, although not exceptional is still great.\n\n\nAspects of the game which are neither great nor awful : \n\n- The graphics are serviceable, but not much more. They don't look very pretty in screenshots, but it absolutely did not bother me while playing. \n\n- The boss fights are a mixed bag, a few are great, but most are simplistic or poorly designed\n\n- The difficulty is not well balanced : Normal is far too easy, and Hard/Nightmare (on a new file) starts off quite tedious, but quickly only becomes marginally more difficult than Normal as you progress. It should be noted that you need to use a password to be able to play above Normal difficulty on a fresh save.\n\n-The story is nothing great, but it does its job in helping the game to move along.\n\n-The 40€ pricetag is pretty hefty for a 10~20 hours game, especially since other metroidvanias on PC tend to be more around 20€.\n\nAnd to finish it off, the parts where the game falters : \n\n-The bugs. There are not that many, but the few that remain are devastating. The worst offender by far is a freezing bug which occurs at random times, with no discernible pattern. The game just freezes when it feels like it (usually after about 10 minutes of play), and you have to kill the process, and start back from your last save. The fix was to only allow the game to run on two cores, and not all four. The fact a bug of this magnitude got into the final release baffles me.\n\nMiram can also be randomly unable to get out of water, requiring the use of a consumable to warp to base, or reloading your last save file.\n\nLastly, enemy loot tends to get stuck (and thus become unobtainable) when the enemy dies too close to a wall, or inside a wall/ceiling, or dies on a slope. Extremely annoying when obtaining item drops is at the heart of the game and some drop rates are quite low.\n\nFrom what I understand, the devs are focusing on the switch port (which is in a much worse state) for now, but it would be nice if these bugs got fixed.\n\n\n-Room design. Many many rooms feel copypasted, and the very vast majority feel uninspired. This is more noticeable in the second half of the game, where most rooms are either a hallway with enemies, a column-type room with a few exits, or a single dead-end rectangular room with an enemy (or not) and a chest.\n\n\nOverall, I'd give the game a 6.5/10. It's definitely above average, and I'd bump it up to 7.5/10 if the bugs I described were fixed. I still think the dev team must be commended for producing what is ultimately a good game despite the extremely chaotic development process it went through.\n\nShould you purchase it ? Considering there are other (and some better) metroidvanias going for 20€ (and some for free if you emulate) while this game is 40€, I would advise buying it only if you are a fan of the genre (metroidvania or igavanias).\nOtherwise, wait for a sale.",Recommended
"Excelent game. If you are a fan of Castlevania SOTN, tis is your game.\nThis one is a lot like Order of Ecclesia, not just for the female protagonist, but fot the abilities she has, absorbing the mosnters powers.\nBut this one is just amazing. I started playing it like a normal game, but now I want to get all of the game, the secrets, the achievments, the weapons, the shards... all, all of it.\nYou wont get dissapointed and definetly wont regret getting this game. Not like MNo.9... cough cough.",Recommended
Good video game,Recommended
"There's presentation problems and awkwardness. A few character models look a bit off or have animation issues. Story scenes often feel like they're missing something, some lines of recorded dialogue don't match the script. The way information about quests, items, etc. is presented can have you repetitively going back and forth between menus.\n\nThere can be hitches as the game loads, bugs where certain graphics effects are missing, occasional dropped inputs.\n\nNevertheless, this might be the only other game in the world that captures the spirit of SotN, even moreso than the GBA and DS Vanias. It's worth it.",Recommended

While some features and addons are still in the works, they are working to ensure that the game would be what was promised and then some.\n\nStory is fairly simple in that, the main Heroine Miriam, is trying to turn back the evil demon hordes and survive.\n\nMusic is very well done and would definitely listen to the music for hours.\n\nGame play is definitely a standard SotN setup, with equip-able weapons, armors, and demon powers.",Recommended

As a huge SOTN fan this game absolutely delivers.,Recommended
Needs some optimisation but its very good,Recommended
"This game was delayed two years past its release date and yet somehow, for me at least, the hype for it just kept building up. And yet somehow, some way, this game lives up all that hype. I absolutely recommend buying it.",Recommended
"I kickstarted this game a few years back.  I loved the DS Castlevanias and SotN, and i wanted more.  This game is everything i hoped it would be and i can't wait for the alternate characters and other stretch goals.",Recommended
"Excellent game that runs and looks great at 4K. The music score is memorable, the controls are just right, the voice acting is cheesy and the story is amusing at best. A bit too much on the difficult side though but still manageable.",Recommended

"É fã de Castlevania Symphony of the Night? COMPRE! É fã de Metroidvânia? COMPRE! É fã de jogos 2d? Preciso dizer?\n\nEsse jogo saciou minha sede por outro Castlevania que eu esperava há tanto tempo... mesmo não sendo da franquia é 100% uma continuação de onde parou, feito com muito carinho pelos criadores, recomendo muito e sempre vai ser um jogo que vou amar.\n\nHá alguns problemas aqui e ali, mas nada que impeça a diversão, muito bom, recomendadíssimo.\n",Recommended
"A perfect sequel to SOTN, Iga has outdone himself. This game is truly phenomenal. Since you're reading this review on Steam you've already passed to test, you won't have to deal with any of the issues found on the console versions!",Recommended
"for those who wished for a new 2d castlevania, Bloodstained is exactly what you wished for; this new license have been carefully crafted to give you back the feeling you remembered so fondly... taking the genre a step further from what you've seen, bloodstained a game created and taylored for the fans by the genre creator himself: Koji IGArashi \nbe carefull for what you wish for because he might be listening....\n\nPS: always bring back the book you borrow. it's called good étiquette.\n",Recommended
"If you liked the Castlevania series (particularly SOTN, Aria of Sorrow or Order of Ecclesia) this is the sequel in all shape and form except the name. Even the enemies are the same just named or skinned slightly differently.\n\nThe only downside is that it's a bit too easy. Then again coming from OoE (which had a hard early game) this was comparatively too trivial.",Recommended
I only got 4 hours of sleep during the 3 days following the release. Pretty good.,Recommended
"I didn't think this game would be as good as it was. It recaptures Symphony of the Night perfectly, with the most memorable castle since that game. One of the best games of the year so far.",Recommended
Awesome game!,Recommended
Worth waiting !,Recommended
THIS GAME MADE ME WET,Recommended
Amazing Game!!!\n\nMy favorite game of this year at this moment. Controls are great and the game play loop is so addictive. Soundtrack is amazing.,Recommended
"Wonderful sidescrolling game. There's a little bit of a learning curve on the first boss, but once you figure out the ability system it turns the game into a breeze. Farming for upgrades and items doesn't feel like a chore. Animation cancelling works well, and it feels really rewarding to learn more advanced dodging and attacking techniques.  \n\nOverall the game feels a little bit short and rushed.  For instance, the quest givers always have the same lines and responses that you have to enter through for every single kill or collect quest.  Outside of this I'd say it's a solid entry into the sidescrolling series and lives up to it's predecessor, Castlevania SotN. I can't wait to see what a sequel will produce.",Recommended
"If you like Symphony of the Night, you will like this.",Recommended
"I am not a fan of this type of games and I haven't played the original Castlevania series back when I was little because it wasn't my cup of tea. With that being said, Bloodstained is a very well made game and you can easily tell that a lot of passion went into it! Simply put, I did not expect to like it that much! I easily recommend this to any player whether you're a fan of this genre or not, you will have a lot of fun!\n\nExtra points for David Hayter being among the voice cast!",Recommended
Worth every penny,Recommended
"This game really scratches Castlevania itch, I highly recommend it. Don't expect anything groundbreaking and new, but it played its strengths very well",Recommended
"Anyone who loves Castlevania: Symphony of the Night will feel right at home in Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night.\n\nThere's alot to love here with the many enemies, techniques, and weapons (Some of which are taken from SotN, Looking at you Rhava Velar). The gameplay feels good and the game looks great, even if it doesn't look as polished as some games.\n\nMy one gripe with this game is how slow movement feels for a large portion of the game, until you get certain shards or figure certain tricks out.\n\nAll in all Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night is a worthy successor to the Metroidvania formula.",Recommended
Great game. If you loved the classic SOTN. You are gonna love this. Has added side quests and crafting elements.\n9/10,Recommended
Very good Castlevania game!,Recommended
It's a legally distinct SOTN with some of the mechanics added in the DS Castlevania titles. Very solid mechanically and the map is huge.,Recommended
Bloodstained is one of best spiritual successor I played however when I played this game on first release week had a game breaking glitch when your character is face gone. it firm locks entire game. it been patched out. There are fan references especially with Castlevania and few metroidvania. It is very enjoyable and it challenging enough the game. Aren't artificially creating difficulty like certain few games like give infinite respawn npc with unlimited ammo and firing like never ending feed minigun. especially few of souls games but i disgrace. yea Bloodstained Ritual of the Night is Recommended sequel to Castlevania Symphony of the Night,Recommended
11/10 Brother Rakesh Approves,Recommended
This game is simply amazing! GOTY 2019,Recommended
Just bought the game today and I am having a nostalgia trip. It combines the aspects of my favorite mechanics from symphony of the night and Aria of sorrow. I would 100% reccommend this game to anyone if they are looking for a metroidvania.,Recommended

"Hell of a game. A love letter to SotN. Konomi could learn from this, but doubtful they will admit to doing so.",Recommended
Really nice game! Best Metroidvania in the last years.,Recommended
Great game for fans of Symphony of the Night!,Recommended
"After playing this game for about 34 hours at the time of this review, I can say that it's a very good successor to Castlevania and others like it. Is it the best example of the genre? No, but it's up there with them and does hold up. Overall, it's a solid experience and one that shouldn't be passed up.",Recommended
"This is a fun game, a bit to easy but fun. If you are a fan of castlevania buy it.",Recommended
Pretty good,Recommended
good,Recommended
Probably one of the best Metroidvanias since SotN. Do yourself a favor and buy this now.,Recommended
"Reminds me of the handheld castlevania games. It isn't too difficult or easy. If it is too hard just do a little bit of grinding. I didn't need to grind, but I wanted to be a complete inventory and farmed items for completion and got some levels on the way. The harder difficulties are a bit tougher for those who want a bit more of a challenge, but don't expect anything too difficult in general. The movement seems fun because there are many options for more skilled and casual players. Same thing with weapons, the variety lets people play with what they want even if it isn't ""optimal"". Generally a good game and I really praise its options and flexibility. The only issue in my opinion is the location of a specific item needed to progress past something in the middle of the game. Overall it is worth it if you like the genre.",Recommended
"If you like the typical Igavanias (SoTN,Aria/Dawn) you'll most certainly enjoy this. If you don't understand what i've just typed, it's still a really good game.",Recommended
Must have for castlevania fans especially SOTN,Recommended
"You've ever wanted to play a game that holds as much value as the world's most expensive gem, simply because of nostalgia and off the wall Metroidvania-esque game effects? Well, look no further. Sit back and enjoy, this spiritual successor.",Recommended
Finally a game that actually scratches that castlevania itch,Recommended
Just awesome in every way. I was nervous about the price but it is worth the money and has a surprisingly large amount of content and replay value.,Recommended
This game is solid 10/10 ez,Recommended
A nostalgic return to my childhood.\n11/10,Recommended
A SoTN sequel we all deserved and we've been waiting for.,Recommended
Great game,Recommended
This is just an amazing game.\nIf you do like the casltevania games you will love this garanteed :D,Recommended
"Fans of old RPG-style Castlevania games will find themselves right at home in Bloodstained's world. For one thing, the game is by IGA, the father of the metroidvania genre himself, who put the 'vania in ""metroidvania"". More importantly, though, it's because it's a IGA Castlevania game (an ""Igavania"", if you will) in all but name.\n\nThe castle is a sprawling gothic maze, full of elements that will feel familiar to fans of IGA's previous work. The shard system is a refinement of Dawn and Aria of Sorrow's souls, the weapons handle much like you'd expect, and enemies are almost (but not-quite) the same as you'd be familiar with. Yet, at the same time it does its own thing just enough to not merely be a tribute, but a worthy start to something new.\n\nBloodstained: Ritual of the Night is a Kickstarter success story that does not disappoint, even in its current state at time of review. With 13 completely free DLC planned, this game should be an instant-buy for any fans of the games that inspired it.",Recommended

"I absolutely love this game. The music tracks have all been amazing, there isn't one in the game that I disliked. The graphics are done in a way to enhance a cinematic experience throughout. The gameplay takes me back to my playstation 1 era of gaming where side-scrolling games like Castlevania were good. This game has met all of my expectations and more, I would highly recommend this game to all my friends! \n\n",Recommended
"About 60 minutes in, it already contains everything one would like from a Castlevania.\n+ whips\n+ semi-retro graphics\n+ simple soundtrack\n+ lots of enemies\n- which are almost entirely cannon-fodder, except for bosses\n+ who can be really difficult\n- but sometimes for the wrong reasons (does not feel as crisp yet for control and hitboxes like DS or Hollow Knight)",Recommended
I'm a backer and so far I LOVE this game. I was reluctant after the mighty no 9 disaster but Iga is a genuine man. He took all the criticism to heart and improved on the early builds for a great looking game. I love Castlevania: Symphony of the Night and this is pretty much the perfect successor to that game. I love the customization options and the difficulty is just right. The game is fun and gives you many options in turns of weapons and crystal shards. Showts out to my MEGA64 clan. Get you Mega64 hat today!,Recommended
This is an amazing game that is everything Castlevania is except it's name.  The graphics are beautiful and the gameplay is so smooth.  You need to play this game now.,Recommended
amazing game and a masterpeace,Recommended
"This game has been an incredible delight.  I highly would recommend this game to anyone who wants to play an interesting side scroll Action/RPG with gothic elements.  I completely loved a game called Castlevania: Symphony of the Night.  And this game is very similar.  You have a level up system, an equipment system, an ability system, a crafting system and ways to do a lot more.  The story itself is interesting.  The start though is a huge amount of text with a voice reading it to you.  You can skip this part as i can understand if you get board with it, as I don't think that will detract from the game play.  The game does have a bit of a grinding element to it.  Killing enemies over and over to get their shards and items.  It does have a nice way of keeping track of things though.  With a in game sort of archive for you that can tell you what drops what and what you have found.  Like Castlevania Symphony of the night, this game features a system showing how much you have unlocked and discovered.  And their are multiple endings as well.  Music is very nice and done extremely well, and i personally did not get tired of listening to it.  Sound effects where also excellent, as bystanders though, friends of mine watching me play where not sure what was being said at times.  Voice acting wasn't too bad either, i enjoyed it.  Overall I would say give this game a try.  I am positive it will become an all time classic.",Recommended
"an absolute must play for all fans of the genre, bloodstained is a masterpiece complete with guitar riffs over classical music.",Recommended

"To put it simply, this is the best Metroidvania since Symphony of the Night.\n\nIf we are talking details then this is a blend of Castlevania: Aria of Sorrow and Castlevania: Order of Ecclesia. Just about everything you've come to expect from this combination is there. The entire game is set in a gigantic castle, wtih and absurd amout of secrets, hidden rooms and unique items to obtain. You've got an absurd amout of weapons with special moves performed by doing Street Fighter style button inputs. Almost every one of over 100 enemies can drop their individual active and passive abilities. And on top of that you even have some visual customization for your main character.\n\nThere are some flaws, though. Unless you're using a guide, prepare to get stuck for a while. Some later game sections require obtaining specific enemy abilites or items, which may be easily overlooked unless you pay attention to the things you collect. The story is not bad by any means, but it certainly is predictable. Lastly, the sidequests are basically all the same and lack any variety.\n\nWith that said, you'll have a hard time finding a better game of this type on Steam. Coupled with a fact that 13 free pieces of DLC is coming, you'll be playing this game for a while.",Recommended
"A return to form for Iga, amazing!",Recommended
Excellent metroidvania game.,Recommended
Exellent game. I bakecd it long ago and I very happy wiht the result\n\nI hope the DLC give a lot more of gameplay and add more achievement.\n\nIf you like metroidvalnia games and really love SofTN this games is for you,Recommended

Worthy spiritual successor to the game that coined the term Metroidvania.,Recommended
"This game plays like you remember Symphony of the Night, not as it was. So it is even better than you imagine.\nDeep crafting system, nice map, fluid and clean gameplay.\nRecommended.",Recommended
"The replay value seems to tank after you play through the game... Until you start a new game, where the enemies locations have changed slightly, there are more of them, and you are now destined to rage at the unexpected damage increase. On the plus side, it is not a hard game to beat, nor even master.\n\nI will say that there are quite a few bugs I have found, that are uncontrollable. Just make sure you save often, or you will have a bad time.",Recommended
A fantastic Metroidvania that has been a delight to play. Ran into a few bugs with bosses only one of which was game breaking (in my favor) but overall it has been solid.,Recommended

I only wish there were more of everything 'cos this game is heavily addictive and once you've finished everything you'd like more.

I'm sure you will too! ;)",Recommended

"It's a 200,6% worthy successor!\n\nMost notable differences for me was the not quite as good soundtrack and the too easy gameplay at default setting.\n\nI'm already hoping for a Bloodstained 2! =)",Recommended
"Wow, what an interesting mix of feelings I experienced with this game. I have played and loved almost every Igavania game out there: Symphony of the Night, Aria of Sorrow, Dawn of Sorrow, Portrait of Ruin and the like. I have also played and loved almost every non-Igavania Metroidvania game: Hollow Knight, Momodora 4, Dead Cells, Ori and the Blind Forest, Dust: An Elysian Tale, Guacamelee, The Shantae series, all of which have filled the empty hole in my soul the Igavania games left in me for a long time. So, naturally, I backed the Kickstarter campaign for this game and waited eagerly and somewhat skeptically for it after the Mighty No. 9 fiasco. The day finally came for me to play this, finishing it in less than 20 hours with almost 100% completion, making me feel like it warrants I leave my own review.\n\nThis game is flawed, very flawed with mostly polish issues and this was the first thing I noticed. The backgrounds in a lot of levels felt stale, and graphic visuals in general overly simplistic despite the improvements they made during development. But it looks appealing enough; quite Gothic in nature and colorful. The enemy and character designs look as great and unique as ever. \n\nThe next thing that somewhat bugged me was the music. I could not help but pick up an out-of-tune sound in a lot of the instruments. Not sure if this was intentional for more Gothic effect, but it bothered me nonetheless. On the other hand, the soundtrack does sound very, veeery classic Igavania and that is fantastic. I even purchased the DLC. Very catchy tunes reminiscent of Symphony of the Night and Aria of Sorrow. Sound effects are crisp and satisfying, and the voice acting cast is magnificent, with excellent performance, especially for Miriam. The rest of the cast however, in some parts felt like they were whispering unnecessarily throughout the majority of their dialogues which I found slightly annoying. I also think they didn't have to add voicing to ALL the dialogue, as I am more than OK with reading it because it's faster for me. I like to jump straight into the gaming unless the story is very rich, which in this case it's not (not that this was a problem for me). \n\nThe mechanics for this game spell classic Igavania all the way. Which is yet another thing that gave me mixed feelings. While I did miss this guy's work for a while, the sudden boom of indie metroidvanias that suddenly came out made me soon forget all about it and did more than enough to fill the void, bringing so many new mechanics and ideas to the table. After playing these, I feel this game was somewhat bland... just a rehash of everything that has already been released in Mr. Iga's projects, and the metroidvanias that came out in his absence made this release feel somewhat dated. Yet the more I played it, the more I fell in love again with the charm I had forgotten Iga's games had. The feel just kept coming back to me, and I felt like I wanted to play it more and more. I had a lot of fun playing this... and now that I finished it, I feel the void once more, which is a good thing. This game, despite its flaws, is a great game that I am sure Metroidvania lovers will appreciate. I welcome the return of Mr. Igarashi's work, and look forward now more than ever for more. Perhaps, these polish issues were just him clearing off some rust, and hopefully this project served as an excellent warm up for even better work to come.",Recommended
"If you enjoyed Castlevania: SOTN, just buy this game now :]",Recommended
Go get it there isn't many games like this.,Recommended
"This game is Castlevania in everything but name, I say that as a good thing.  I would say this game is closer to Aria of Sorrow than Symphony of the Night but the game play is excellent. I was also impressed with the English voice acting, I was expecting it to be a little flat but over all works really well. (It also helps they got David Hayter to play a character but you know...) Over all if you like the Metroidvania style Castlevania games I can throughly recomend this game to you.",Recommended

"If you played Castlevania: Symphony of the Night, liked it,  but thought Alucard could really use some lady bits, this will scratch that itch. The one thing missing though is some hilariously bad Japanese to English translation. All the translations in this are, unfortunately, quite reasonable. If I had to pick a gripe, the story is only adequate. The ""twists"" are predictable, the villain's motives are questionable, and easily avoided events are not avoided because of the ""there is no time to explain!"" cliche. That being said, the gameplay is great, and for those of us nostalgic for this type of game, highly recommended.",Recommended

"An absolute IGAvania, as promised.\n\nBloodstained has been largely backed and purchased by Symphony of the Night fans thirsty for more, and as a fan and backer, I believe Bloodstained meets the demand. From the graphic design to the sound to the mechanics, Bloodstained hits all the right notes. In fact, several level designs and other elements seem lifted almost wholesale from Symphony of the Night (there's even a library-related achievement winking at this). But Bloodstained is enough its own game to stand and deliver.\n\nThe Bloodstained campaign made a big deal about IGA's responsiveness to fan criticisms of the graphics and animation evident in beta, and indeed, all of those elements have been noticeably improved. Personally, I still see room for improvement over some clunky animations and other details, but it's not an experience-breaking point, and who knows; if Bloodstained received a facelift in a future update, it wouldn't be the first game ever to do so.\n\nIn brief, if you're here for a continuation of the Symphony of the Night experience, pull the trigger; Bloodstained has what you want. And if you have no idea what I'm talking about, still, try it out on my recommendation. It's a great game, and if you don't like it, you can save your money avoiding the whole Metroidvania subgenre.",Recommended

"This game is a 2019 SOTN. I went in with low expectations and have been blown away. It plays great, visuals are good, but what I can’t get over is the amount of SOTN fan service. So many sections will have you saying “wait a minute, I remember this!”. I won’t spoil anything but there have been so many delightful surprises I cannot recommend this game enough. A must buy for SOTN fans\n\nI will say I have had a fair about of game crashing bugs but if you save often it’s not a big deal, blowing through the intro screens and loading your save takes 5 seconds",Recommended
"While I did not back this game during the Kickstarter campaign due to the bad taste that Mighty Number 9 left, I am happy to say that Koji Igarashi and his team have stepped up and delivered a wonderful new game. \n\nBloodstained: ROTN delivers to fans of the Metroidvania genre a new game which satisfies and challenges the player. At the time of writing, I've played over 12+ hours and the game looks gorgeous and plays wonderfully as you hack and slash through hoards of demons. Controls are tight and I have no complaints considering my expectations were met as being a SOTN fan. \n\nMusic is what you'd expect from composer Michiru Yamane, who's composition sets the tone of the world that they've created. Some sound effects come off as very familiar to those from the Castlevania franchise, too. \n\nThe story and interaction between the various characters is engaging also. Bosses are very difficult to defeat to the point where you will need to grind Miriam's stats to ensure she has a fighting chance against them. Even saying that, beating bosses is satisfying to know you earned it, rather than it being a walk in the park. \n\nThe game also offers a variety of different side quests / hunts that Miriam can complete which will net her rewards. This is a nice way of changing things up and bringing more variety to the game. Miriam can also craft different weapons / items and even food to assist her on her journey. Eating food will increase her overall stats, so you'll want to get your figure out which meals provide the best at improving her stats. \n\nOverall I highly recommend this game if you're a fan of the Metroidvania genre, or if you're looking to jump into a new franchise which is engaging and challenging.",Recommended
"In the simplest terms Bloodstained:  ROTN is basically a throwback to Castlevania SOTN which is kind of a cheat since it's one of the best games of all time.\n\nBloodstained does have a few things going for it with a more easily manageable item, food and spell maintenance system in place.\n\nIn general I enjoyed the opportunity to play a game like this again for the spirit of discovering the castle, finding out which monsters drop which items and experimenting with my new spoils of war.\n\nI don't necessarily think the slow pace you explore the castle (Especially the first time) is a bad thing but I oftentimes found it frustrating when exploring how long it would take to go room by room to find out which piece of the puzzle I missed or what I needed to do.\n\nIf you like games like Metroid, Hollow knight, Castlevania or Dead Cells I would recommend this game.\n\n",Recommended

"What can I say about this, it's a Castlevania (or Igavania for those that prefer that) without being actually called Castlevania, if you ever played any of the older Igavania games (Especially Aria of Sorrow and the ones after that), you will feel right at home with this one.\n\nAlso getting a few free multiplayer modes in the future as well as a bunch of other free dlc's like a roguelike mode for example, which means random generated castles for those unfamiliar with the term.",Recommended
"By far one of the best games I have purchased in the past year. Easy to get into and has that authentic ""metroidvania"" feel. A must own for sure.",Recommended
"Worth every penny.\nGreat metroidvania game, albeit a bit short.",Recommended
"I backed this game on Kickstarter four years ago and after the whole Mighty No. 9 car crash and how long the game was in development I was worried I'd burned up £60, but now it is out and it is fantastic and is the best Symphony of the Night style Castlevania I've ever played.",Recommended
"This game reached an unattainable level of hype through one of the most successful Kickstarter campaigns ever, developed by the guy that invented the Metroidvania genre, with the express goal of being the biggest, bestest metroidvania ever created.\nThe game isn't even fully finished yet, but it still lives up to every bit of the hype. You're doing yourself a disservice reading this review instead of playing it.",Recommended
No longer needs SotN in my life. There's bloodstained.,Recommended
"I will update this as time goes on.\n\nIGAvania Castlevania's are by far my favorite solo genre.  I believe I am 50% through the first Normal game play.  Normal mode is fairly easy for myself, only having died to 3 bosses through Bloodless.  It keeps growing on me and gets better and better.\n\nThe only issue I have so far is minor glitches.  On parts where they blend the 3d, attacks don't line up very well.  If an enemy drop doesn't have 100% clear line of sight to fall it glitches as un-collectable.  There is a weird black screen glitch on some stairs.  \n\nI also haven't confirmed yet that some of the weapon techniques are 1-weapon specific (normally if you master a weapon technique you can then use on any weapon of that type), but some show as un-masterable.",Recommended
it good,Recommended
"I backed the game when it was first announced on Kickstarter and after 100%ing the game I can safely say that it's what I wanted.\n\nIt's by no means flawless, but  the nice things shine brighter than the things that aren't perfect (at least in my opinion).\n\nThere are clever puzzles, which if you don't look up how to solve them, are very satisfying to discover on your own.\n\nThe music by Michiru Yamane is stellar and infuses the game with an instant-classic sort of feel, needless to say, the OST is really good to have in your collection (if that's your sort of thing).\n\nSome people are miffed about the fact that some of the backer only stuff was made available via DLC (IGA Backpack) but I personally don't mind. I think it's fair that others also get access to it. If I was on the receiving end, I'd be glad that there aren't any in-game things I can never access just because I didn't back the game back when.\n\nOverall, it's a ton of fun if you like Metroidvania games, there's enough here to warrant the price, assuming you care to 100% the game, if you just care to finish the story you could probably complete it faster, but then again the game has replay value and speedrunners are also probably gonna have a good time.",Recommended
"This is a great Castlevania game.  I even keep calling it that without noticing it.  There's a little bit of sloppiness (sometimes items drop in a way they can't be picked up, for example) and some throwback stuff that I could live without (low drop rates, inconsistent boss difficulties) but there's a lot to explore and it's fun so play it.",Recommended
I enjoyed this game. Classic Igavania gameplay mechanics with modern graphics.,Recommended
Its really like Castlevania !!,Recommended
Better than castlevania so far :^),Recommended
"All of my yes. This game is everything I was hoping for from a metroidvania by Iga. It's sad that the Castlevania franchise, which used to provide this exact kind of experience, will not be continued... but if this is taking its place... well, I'm okay with that!",Recommended
Great game with lots of unlockables and secrets.,Recommended
"It's a fun game. \n\nThe game started to drag a little when I hit around ~37% of the map explored, but then I accidently did a drop kick. Doing a dropkick, double jump, dropkick, double jump opened things up and was a good time. I'm not sure if wasn't paying or how I missed learning how to do that in the first place.",Recommended
"Dead ass gives me SotN vibes better than any other game ive played similar to this genre. Id reccomend this to anyone who likes vania games, as it is a bop.",Recommended

"All the best things about SOTN and AOS. If you enjoy Castlevania, you literally can't go wrong. \nUnless your idea of a good Castlevania game is the fighting game for Wii.\n",Recommended
The games art is leagues better than was initially shown but that's only one of many of the great aspects of the game. After playing through the game on normal i can say its well worth your time to play on a higher difficulty as the enemy layout is different and the bosses have new attack patterns so unless you play on higher difficulties you never get to experience the game to the fullest.,Recommended
"Exactly what I want out of a Metroidvania. It's enough of a throw-back for me to settle into easily, while still introducing new mechanics and fun",Recommended
This gam is suuuuoper good. 10/10 would bsng.,Recommended
"Really good, like old castlevania games and looks great.",Recommended
Bloodstained is a game i had been looking forward to as a Recommended successor of iga set of castlevania and this game does not disapoint so far. The game does feel like an aria of sorrow or dawn of sorrow redone on a better engine. The game does start a bit slow but that is do to the leveling up system and i feel that after the first boss and enough levelling up and new weapons you begin to get through enemies alot quicker.,Recommended
"sweet metroidvania. controls very smooth and precise. i especially like that you can ""suspend"" your current status anytime when you have to stop playing for a while, you dont necesarily have to find the next savepoint when you need to take a break cause real life calls.",Recommended

It's pretty good.,Recommended
"This game is definitely for those who  reminisce with SotN or the collection of 3ds Castlevania games.  I've experienced minor bugs throughout my progression.  One of the bugs required a reload; however, the game has me so entranced I didn't care.  That speaks volumes about a game. The shard system is intriguing and adds additional gameplay hours for completionists.  The controls are tight and the developer deliberately added ways to access areas of the game without having  certain items (can't wait for speed runs). Overall I give it an 8/10, once the bugs are patched out, I'd gladly give it a perfect score.  I've not been this caught up in a game in years.",Recommended
"Very good continuation of classic igavania games, but a quite a bit unbalanced even on harder difficulties (some familiars and projectile spells are just too good, while others are kind meh..).",Recommended
"there is no need to write an essay about why this game is worth its price. if you expect AAA quality from this game you won't find and also this game is not pretend like AAA title. its an awesome fun and challenging game with amazing soundtrack and huge enemey variety\n\ni normaly never review games on steam but this game deserve a thumbs up imo, kudos to the developers",Recommended
Is real good,Recommended
"It's Castlevania with anime visuals and a waifu MC with fairly good customization.\n\nPros: Classic metroidvania gameplay\nMassive variety in terms of magic (Shards in this game)\nA simple but robust crafting system\nIncredible mobility, by the end of the game you can move lightning fast, teleport short distances, use light to bounce around on reflective surfaces to teleport longer distances, invert gravity instantly, double jump, and even more.\nTons of different weapons\nFighting game inputs for skills\nLooks great\nGreat soundtrack\nTons of replay value due to how every single enemy in the game has unique drops you can farm\nAnimation cancelling means the game has an unlimited skillcap more or less, I think we'll see this as an interesting speedrun game soon.  \n\n\nCons: Still a tad bit buggy, there are a few ways you can get yourself stuck early in the game and you'll be forced to quit and reload to escape.\nOccasionally some poor optimization makes the game run poorly in areas for no real reason, but it's only marginal performance drops.\nGame is very cheese-able, some shards are clearly so much better than others.",Recommended
"This game is just like old school Castlevania, but prettier and more modern. Get it!\n\n\nEDIT: I've just beaten the game. It's beautiful, well polished, and holds your attention until the end. Still recommending to get it if you enjoy Igavania (Symphony of the Night, Aria of Sorrow, etc.)",Recommended
"Worth the four year wait. It's basically Castlevania: SotN with upgraded graphics.  The game runs like a dream, I was able to play at 4k/~55FPS on a 970 with minimal slowdowns.\n\nIf you're a fan of the Metroidvania genre, you'll enjoy this new game from the creator of the genre.",Recommended
It's basically SOTN 2.,Recommended
This game has great visuals and interesting mechanics.  So far Ive had a good time playing it.,Recommended
This game gave me a headache in my pants.,Recommended
"I came into this game a bit fearful, since some reviews were really negative, but man, this game is freaking awesome.\n\nFun from start to finish, hell, even the grind for some items if you are a completionist is enjoyable. \n\nGreat purchase, absolutely recommended.",Recommended
Just great,Recommended
"All the best things from Symphony of the Night, cranked up to 11.",Recommended

"Between last year's excellent, retro ""Bloodstained: Curse of the Moon"" and this, it's clear that Castlevania is dead and buried. Rest in peace, Konami. \n\nLong live BLOODSTAINED!!",Recommended
"This is a wholesome Metroidvania / Igavania experience. The game is very good and delivered it's promise. Although, if you are completely new to the genre, you might have a hard time at some spots, the game does not treat you gently and does not hold your hands, which is awesome for most players.",Recommended
"If you want a high quality classic style Igavania game in the vein of Symphony of the Night, look no further. It's exceptional.",Recommended
YEH NAH YEH,Recommended
I can't express how much I love this game. It's now in my top 5 favorite of all time.,Recommended
Love it! Iga did great with this game! Never had as much fun in this genre since SOTN.,Recommended
I used to have friends. We used to do things together. Now I'll briefly see them and everyone will be muttering about how far they've progressed and which shards are the best shards and map percentage and how much they all hate shoving food down that old woman's throat. And since I'm not doing things with my friends anymore I fill up the void by playing Bloodstained as well. It's a vicious cycle.,Recommended
"Short and sweet. Big fan of Castlevania!\n\nCastlevania: Symphony of the Night being my favorite game, picking this up is a no brainer. \n\nIt starts a little slow, but everything you expect in a good Castlevania game are all present, great work.\n\nI have one small issue with the game, the full map. The full map view makes you zoom back in every time you view the map, it feels broken and is a pain, i'm hoping they fix it soon. It still isn't a deal breaker by far, but it needs to be fixed.",Recommended
"I was a backer for this game, I would say it is money well spent, super fun game! There is a lot of freedom to what set up you want Miriam to do and the story is pretty good, though not ground breaking. Nevertheless I enjoyed playing, I love the artwork, and hope they will release the art book to the public, I would buy in a heartbeat!",Recommended
real good :),Recommended
I had a lot of fun with this game. Lots of weapon and ability variety. \nCloser to the Castlevania side than the Metroid side of the metroidvania genre. \nI did not personally encounter any bugs or issues with the game.,Recommended
"While the core gameplay and variety of enemies is enjoyable and interesting, unless you're willing to look at guides the enjoyment you'll get out of Bloodstained is going to depend heavily on how willing you are to comb the environment for hidden, unimportant looking chests and enemies that in fact hold incredibly important, progression-required items. Bloodstained has no clear delineation between regular items and skills and those of immense gameplay importance, and makes little attempt to guide you to towards them. In one instance, I had to kill a single enemy [i]ten[/i] times, resetting the screen in-between each kill to respawn them, in order for a VITAL crystal to drop. The only reason I knew to grind this one enemy out was because I had looked a guide up. How would I ever have known otherwise?\n\nIn short, Bloodstained is best enjoyed with a google tab open.",Recommended
"Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night is a great blend of Oldschool Castlevania-esque gameplay in a modern packaging.\nWhile the gameplay can be a tad confusing at first for people not familiar with Castlevania or Metroid, and the fact that restoration items can be a pain to craft (each needing a bunch of different reagents and there's no easy way to figure out where and how to get them) it's a really solid game all around.\n\nA lot of fun and easily 50+ hours if you're going for the good ending.\n\nDefinitely a bunch more if you're going for a 100% completion.\n\nI'd recommend it to anyone who likes Castlevania, Metroid or old school action platformers.",Recommended
Do the the classic thing in a sweet new box with tons of weapons and spells.,Recommended
"As a man that's been waitin for SOTN to get out of the clutches of Sony and into the world I had really high expectations on ROTN.\nIga made what he does best again with a extensive map, secrets, weapons/magic and enemies. This definitely this is the succesor we needed after all these years",Recommended

A more then worthy succesor to the Castlevania games of old. Takes what is best from the old games then improves on it and adds some flavors of it's own,Recommended
"Its been said by others, but this is truly the Symphony of the Night sequel we have been waiting for.  The game's depth, music, art, and amazing gameplay bring together an unforgettable experience.  I can't wait to play it see what kind of DLC comes for the game!",Recommended

"This is the spiritual successor of Castlevania SOTN.\nFrom 10 minutes in you will start to feel that, I assure you.\nInitially the art style did not convinced me but it takes very little time to grow on you.\nSo if your doubts are about the graphic, don't worry, it's not an issue.\n\nThe game has TONs of contents and needs to be explored.\nThere is a crafting system which I am currently exploring to see which is the best things you can get from it.\nSome items require quite a lot of grind but as I stated initially, also SOTN required tedious farm for some really good results.\n\nI purchased it on a full price and I AM FULLY SATISFIED.\nIt met my expecation and I'm loving it.",Recommended
"It was stunning to me to see that developers were still able to make a game on pair with Castlevania: Symphony of the Night. I have played Castlevania: Symphony of the Night, Castlevania: Curse of Darkness, Castlevania: Lament of Inocence and Castlevania: Lord Of Shadows and these are only the games that i have actually completed to exaustion, i am a big fan of the Castlevania franchise.\nBloodstained made me feel like i was twelve again, playing Castlevania for fun. In front of the computer, i was just a boy again, playing a game that gave me a world and a fantasy to live as if life was anew.\nI highly recommend this game if you are a Castlevania or metroidvania game, this game has all of the amazing features of the Castlevanias that i played to exaustion, crafting of Castlevania: Curse Of Darkness, level design of Castlevania: Symphony of the Night and the amazing spells of Castlevania: Lament of Inocence.",Recommended
pros:\n - good game play and crafting system\n - good music and graphics\n\ncons:\n - bad translation for other languages(Except JP or US i think)\n - many bugs(although the bugs i met not affecting the gameplay),Recommended
Finally OG metroidvania is back!,Recommended
Easily the GOTY so far,Recommended
"It's like the older game Castlevania Symphony of the Night on Ps1 except different graphics, pretty much.\nIt's an awesome game, wonderful music, what's not to love here if you are like me and have always loved Castlevania games.\nThere's a bit of story, the game is a bit on the easy side like these games always have been, but i can't recommend it enough still.",Recommended
"Truly the Game that comes closest to Castlevania since SotN, If you are a Fan or at least no Anime Hater you might even like it more.",Recommended
"As a big fan of Symphony of the Night, I enjoyed this game an awful lot. The cel shaded art style isn't my favorite, but it looks nice enough. Very frequently you will have no idea whatsoever where you're supposed to go, so either get used to running around aimlessly or looking stuff up. Overall, definitely fun if you're in the mood for a classic 2D Metroid-vania.",Recommended
Amazing,Recommended
"Finally a Recommended IGAvania!\n\nIf you play Symphony of the Night, Aria of Sorrow, Dawn of Sorrow, Portrait of Ruin or Order of Ecclesia, Bloodstained is a worthy successor to all of them. Backdash crouch cancelling, jump kick spam, attack backdash cancelling, landing attack cancelling everything is there and more! I loved this game the only con with this game is it is too short! My first IGAvania was PoR, however its is a beautiful game with lots of ways to play! \n\nI loved this game and you will too!",Recommended
Get it,Recommended
"So far this is everything I wanted! Seems to stand up there with the best of the Metroidvania type games. 2.5D graphics look a little bit cheap, but otherwise truly enjoying everything about this game!

Nice throwback to games like Castlevania: Symphony of the Night, and Castlevania: Aria of Sorrow. \n\nMy biggest complaint is the sameness of some monster types, with monsters from different areas essentially being slightly modified  re-skins/edits.\n\nOverall, the game is still solid.",Recommended
"This really shows what Kickstarter games can be, a chance to revisit a style of game that publishers won't touch anymore.\n\nIt's pretty much Symphony of the Night but with less goofy voice acting.",Recommended

Overall just a really well made game, excellent mechanics, tonnes of weapons to mess around with. Soon to be a Recommended classic.",Recommended
"If you've been dying for another DSVania game, you definitely won't be disappointed by Bloodstained. Biggest complaint I have is that it doesn't let you select harder difficulties on your first playthrough, and it feels too easy once you get going with strong equipment and abilities.\n\nI was a bit put off by the graphical style at first, but it quickly grew on me.",Recommended
"Bloodstained is a magnificent game, combining many aspects of IGA's entries in the Castlevania franchise into one solid package with a new identity. There's little I can say about it that others haven't already said. Honestly, if you're even considering getting it, just get it. It is 100% worth your time.",Recommended
"If you miss castlevania style gameplay, you shud try out this game",Recommended
"Another great metroidvania that is an omage to all Castlevanias. This game feels like a continuation of the DS Castlevania games.

"This is a pretty fun game to play, mechanics and responsiveness are top notch. The environments and music ambients the game well, the characters and voice actors are amazing, minor bugs here and there but nothing a patch can't fix. This feels like a shameless castlevania knock off, but it's okay the same guy who directed the bests castlevanias to date simply told Konami to shove it and made the game we all wanted. I'm not a backer still had lots of fun and appreciation for this whole ensemble. Koji Igarashi has given us what we wanted, to question  if this a better game than previous castlevanias is for schmuks. It's a must play is what it is.",Recommended

Get it.\n\nLong: So we finally get to see IGA in his own, natural habitat, with the funding he finally wanted, and the ability to create his own things rather than being tied down to the lore of Castlevania. It's wonderful. Farming crystals feels good, the gameplay is fun and responsive, each weapon type feels like it has a unique use, and the special moves make everything that much better.

I've been waiting for this game to release 4 years ago when I backed the Kickstarter and I've gotta say it delivered.\n\n+ The game looks and feels very polished.\n+ in Recommended Castlevania fashion the game is far from linear especially when you consider that the devs implemented some \n   intentional sequence breaks.\n+ Wide variety of weapons with some cool enemy rare drops that really make you feel lucky.\n+ The game is still going to get a lot of extra content over the next year.\n\n- The game is pretty short considering it's price tag\n- In order to progress through the story the game requires you to do some pretty obscure things such as farming a random \n  enemy (I personally didn't have any issues with that because I like to 100% games from the start but some friends were \n  stuck because of aforementioned reasons),Recommended

This is probably the first review i make.\n\nWhat is a man?\nThis game delivers a tasteful and maximum fun to the metroidvania or shall i say.. this is the best Igavania game has ever been existed. The art the story the gothic elements. the best Castlevania experience. the soundtracks are breathtaking.. no you're breathtaking Igarashi san!\n\naside from jokes i dunno how to make reviews cause i'm a miserable little pile of secrets so here's the score:\n10/10,Recommended
Good spiritual successor\n\nalso mc is cute,Recommended
"11/10\n\nIf you enjoyed any Castlevania series game from Symphony of the Night onward, this game will remind you of why you did.\n\nBloodstained is somewhat derivative of games like SotN and Aria of Sorrow, but maintains itself as a stand out series nonetheless. It's clear that an incredible amount of love and care went into this game.\n\nThe visuals hold up excellently, the gameplay is tight and responsive, weapons and spells feel fun and powerful, at times even visceral. The menus, controls, and UI are intuitive and satisfying, and the platforming holds up. I haven't yet reached a point where I fell from something that wasn't my own fault. \n\nThe music and environments heavily draw on their source material, as one would expect from Iga's tenure with the Castlevania franchise. It seems like the game at times is trying to remind you ""remember the underwater level? The waterfall? The library?"" And yet still they manage to put their own spin on these areas, the sounds, the music, and their inhabitants.\n\nFrankly, the story and character building of the game is the only thing I give a solid ""meh"", but the metroidvania genre doesn't lend well to cutscenes anyway, pretty and well voice acted though they may be. The story itself is straightforward, but we all know that's not why we're playing a Metroidvania anyway.\n\nFinally, the game isn't even finished yet and I'm still floored. With more free dlcs to come, there's only going to be more to love.\n\nIf you're on the fence and want to experience the magic of a Metroidvania after years of being burned by lackluster clones, I can promise you that you won't be disappointed.",Recommended
"First of all, I want to thank Mr Koji Igarashi and the rest of the staff for bringing this game to fruition. And, I would like to thank the people who backed Igarashi's campaign.\n\nWhen I heard about this game, I was hoping that it would come to PC, since I have been a PC owner for the last few years and I have played a few of the Castlevania games that Igarashi had produced and worked behind in the past.\n\nMy initial impression of B:RotN was that it was a bit tedious, that there was plenty of grinding to do and that it was going to be a bit tough. I hadn't played a Castlevania game for a number of years, apart from the most recent ones (incl. Mirror of Fate) and they are very different from Igarashi's Castlevania games.\n\nWhat happened to me was the fact that I ended up going through one play of the game. [spoiler]Just like with my first session of Castlevania: SotN many years ago, finishing the game with the ""bad"" ending.[/spoiler] I, somehow, ended up corrupting the file, and had to restart all over again. It probably didn't sync well. I redid all I had to do. Didn't take too long, because of some minor grinding and knew how the mechanics worked and how the bosses fought. \n\nThe story's protagonist, Miriam, arrives on the Galleon Minerva (which is funny, if you only look up what domains the Roman goddess, Minerva, supposedly looked over. Some actually pertain to what you can and will do in the actual game.) and ventures forth into a ""village"" near the castle that apparently popped up for a certain reason, but not before some resistance against some enemies. Most of the exploration, obviously, is to be done in the castle.\n\nWhat you find out about Miriam is that she has the power to absorb shards. The mechanics behind B:RotN is based around soul shards, a la Castlevania's Aria of Sorrow and Dawn of Sorrow's soul system. And, that's where many of Igarashi's Castlevania references begin.\n\nDuring your play, you'll find references to previous titles from the Castlevania titles that Igarashi worked on. Most of the locations, even though under different names, will be memorable to those that have played those types of locations in his previous titles. Even a few enemies return, like bats, ghosts and that classic enemy, Buer. Some may have returned, but with a different name and appearance, such as the Morte and Bone Morte (likely to be Zombie and Bone-throwing Skeleton).\n\nDo not expect this to be a Castlevania game from start to finish.... No. There is a fair bit that Igarashi and his team have implement that feels unique.\n\nIf you're worried about items and weapons, there's no need, since there is ample to be found and crafted from different items you can pick up from enemies along your journey, and from different chests. And, believe it or not, there are certain chests that respawn with basic items to craft into items. Secrets also abound, with breakable walls for items or new rooms. So, do be on the lookout, if you plan to play.\n\nOverall, it's like walking down memory lane, but in a stylish and completely different setting. Igarashi and his team have brought their best, so far, to the table, as it appears. But, as Koji has said, there is more content to come and I can not wait for that content. I am not too worried about a Co-op or Duel mode, since I do not play online or local with others, but I am particularly interested in that Rogue mode that is supposed to be coming.\n\nSo, to you Mr Koji Igarashi and team, Arigatou gozaimasu.",Recommended

"Never paid much attention to the metroidvania genre because I the find the usual retro, low-budget design off-putting. Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night though is an earnest effort with more pleasant modern visuals, audio and mechanics.\n\nThe character progression and exploration is addicting. The story isn't bad and has full voice acting.\n\nYou will gain experience fighting a wide variety of enemies and completing quests. Find and craft new equipment. There are several weapons types each with a few special attacks you can learn called techniques. There's dozens of shards that grant new abilities and spells.\n\nI usually find backtracking annoying, but with fast travel points it's no big deal. It's satisfying to get to that previously blocked area or unreachable chest after you've gained the right shard.\n\nThe boss fights are cool and fairly challenging. They may take a couple tries to learn their attack pattern, make you reconsider your loadout or grind some levels.\n\nI've still got a ways to go and there's quite a lot of free DLC coming!",Recommended

"Kickstarter backer here, no regrets. The game brings some of the best elements of previous Iga Castlevania games like Symphony of the Night (gameplay/control), Order of Ecclesia (shards/abilities), and Curse of Darkness (soundtrack, art/graphics).\n\nIf you're a fan of those, you'll be a fan of this.

"Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night is a decent return to form for former Castlevania series director Koji Igarashi, however in the 10+ years of his absence the genre has been pushed forward significantly by other indie titles that make Bloodstained feel mostly unremarkable once you've reached its conclusion. I'd suggest looking to other indie titles until Bloodstained's price gets a cut in the future, as it's nearly triple the price for content which is often less polished or memorable than its many cheaper contemporaries.\n\n[b]PROS:[/b]\n---\n[list]\n[*] Fast, accessible gameplay. The game doesn't dwell on long tutorials, dialogue, or general fluff. Miriam controls great and most options available to her are viable and fun to use.\n\n[*] The Castle layout/design is strong and fun to navigate, particularly as you obtain new abilities to uncover new secrets. Unfortunately most of these abilities don't see as much use as they could.\n\n[*] Though not their best work given Castlevania's legacy, the soundtrack is serviceable and atmospheric throughout.\n\n[*] Rich in nostalgia and easter eggs. Many homages from SOTN and the portable Castlevanias throughout are fun to uncover. Gameplay-wise this is a spiritual successor to Aria/Dawn of Sorrow above all the others, and fans of those two titles will likely feel right at home playing Bloodstained.\n\n[b]CONS:[/b]\n---\n[list]\n[*] Expensive compared to other indievanias. For the 36-40 dollar price, you can get Cave Story, Hollow Knight, Ori, Axiom Verge, and more for less than half Bloodborne's price.\n\n[*] Unremarkable story and characters. Uninteresting lore, character development mostly occurs off screen. Miriam's character never develops from when she begins her journey, either.\n\n[*] Poorly paced balance and difficulty. It is very easy to incidentally become overpowered with abilities you randomly pick up and steamroll the game for the next few hours. Items can be spammed and easily trivialize health/resource management.\n\n[*] Grindy, linear crafting system which relies on ridiculous drop rates as low as 2% and guesswork if you've never seen some drops before. Obtaining Recommended 100% completion becomes a chore.\n\n[*] Mileage may vary on the combat, but for me this is mostly weak, as many enemies are non-issues, and most bosses susceptible to being killed so quickly that you'll rarely have to really learn their patterns.\n\n[*] A very rushed final act. The final 2 areas of the game are a clear rush job in story and gameplay, becoming very linear and reusing assets in the most cheap way possible by recycling enemies but only making them bigger or recolored with only bosses serving as new encounters. You obtain a potentially game altering new ability to navigate with but only use it for a SINGLE room before reaching the final boss. Overall a pretty poor conclusion.

"[b] 9.5 / 10, The Nostalgia Strikes Back [/b]\n\nBloodstained : Ritual of the Night is a phenomenal title to add to most people's game libraries these days as Koji Igarashi outdoes himself with the latest IP. If you enjoyed playing Castlevania :SotN style games, this is definitely up your alley as the newest protagonist, Miriam, fits the bill, becoming our new Alucard.\n\n\nGameplay: 9/10  -    Miriam is allowed a whole assortment of equipment ranging from Whips to Swords, Lances, Halberds, Staffs, Guns, and even boots for her own feet. The dynamics of the compelling and enticing game-play continue when you encounter ""shards"", demonic upgrades as the core mechanic of the game. These shards allow you to do a variety of things which include passive abilities, active summons, spell casts such as fireballs or iceballs, and even transform Miriam into a demon succubus with kick ass moves. Literally! The complexity of the combat ranges well, allowing the player to choose how they want to play. Anything will work in essence and the compounding accumulation of these ""shards"" works as a story element as well which is clever. These ""shards"" may or may not corrupt Miriam if left unchecked.\n\nInstead of Relics, Miriam undergoes shards that are necessary to progress the game as certain areas are blocked until you acquire specific shards. Similarly to SotN, Miriam can learn techniques adding more depth to weapons. Each weapon/weapon class has its own set of techniques that can be discovered through various book shelves found in the game. Don't expect ""Dark Metamorphosis"" or ""Soul Steal"" however!\n\nAnother aspect of the game-play is the status table and resistances. Each enemy has their own weaknesses and resistances and can be displayed once killed in the player's encyclopedia found in the menu. Nasty statuses such as Curse which limit your max HP and Mana can properly dismantle a healthy Miriam, so come well equipped for every encounter! \n\nEach equipment item is also essential, allowing Miriam to bolster certain stats such as LUCK, STRENGTH AND CONSTITUTION. LUCK for example, enables crit chance and item drops which is handy when farming for rare equipment! \n\nMiriam can create food through alchemy, acquiring buffs and stat bonuses through eating! Just as well, the player can upgrade shards, create new equipment, and even find new recipes. On top of the already stellar gameplay, Bloodstained showcases a well-thought out crafting system.\n\nAll in all, a great, intuitive design that flows well and plays just like SotN. Welcome to the family Miriam!\n\nStory: 7/10  - The story follows a cursed land ransacked by Demons, and in an attempt to counter this, Alchemists forced humans to undergo procedures to acquire Demonic power to combat the evils that plagued them. This created shards, and rarely a shard user was the byproduct of both miracle and curse as very rarely the procedure is a success. Miriam, being a shard user that was saved from ultimately dying from the procedure, follows after Gebel, another shard user into a castle of horror in this twisted strand of events.\n\nOverall, the story is good, but isn't as complex as the game-play. Certain characters are just dull and stay the same. Plot holes open up here and there. But don't look to the game for an amazing story, look to it for game-play! The story is solid, but nothing intriguing.\n\nSound: 10/10 - The sound design is impeccable, and the musical composer is the very same from SotN! When delving into each section of the game, a different piece of music is there! Great music track and sound design make for an amazing unforgettable experience! Its a game you can't put down!\n\nGraphics: 8/10 - Fixing the issue with the lighting alleviated the issue of dull atmosphere! But there are blemishes here and there. Elements of the game can be fixed in time however. The backdrops are amazing, and going through new rooms feels rejuvenating! A completely new adventure that will overtake you! Just like SotN!\n\nFun Factor: 9/10 - Overall, the game is NOT lackluster in the slightest! It's f*cking fun as heck! New playstyles, techniques, shards, and upgrades add limitless replayability and fun to the game. It feels good on the controller, just as well as with keyboard. If you want a new game to try out and have an itch for a new RPG, this is it!\n\nValue Factor: 10/10 - Promises of a Co-Op/Multiplayer, DLC, and more content add potential to the already great package. Hours will add up after playing the game for a while through replays, and new characters will make extra playthroughs fresh and exciting! For about $40, you're getting a game that should be worth $60! Its a steal!\n\nBuy the dang thing!\n\n- John",Recommended

"Did you like Castlevania? Specifically the DS games? Because this takes so much from them that it's impossible to talk about this game without mentioning it. It isn't bringing anything new. You get a map grid, explore it get upgrades, level up, absorb monster spells and enjoy a cheesy story that doesn't matter and its hard to tell if it takes itself seriously either.\n\nThe graphics are good, but highly dependent on your opinion so your mileage is gonna vary. The combat feels exactly like castlevania with great animations and fun monster variety. The game has a modest length that will last you at least a half-dozen hours if you feel like rushing, or a dozen or two if you want to take it slow and explore.",Recommended
Game is wicked fun to play. If you are a fan of Metroidvania then it's a great pick. Can't say it's not worth the current price but can say that it would for sure be worth it at a decent sale. The future DLC should make it a bargain for sure. Typically I try to get $1/hr of playtime out of a game for me to figure it a good deal. I don't see myself being disappointed even if I fall short with this one.,Recommended
"There are many games in the Metroidvania genre of games, in their exploration and item finding, but few games actually feel similar to the 2D Metroid or later Castlevania games. Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night ticks the box for Castlevania nostalgia, while modernizing itself, which allows it to stand on its own.\n\nThere are so many weapons, magic abilities, and techniques that every can find their own style to play. Many weapons and abilities are quite unique.\n\nThe castle is memorable and unique rooms stand out. During my initial playthrough I could easily remember what rooms I wanted to return to them later.\n\nThe story isn't too unique, but works well enough and I grew to like the characters.\n\nOn Normal Difficulty the game is actually pretty easy, and gets easier when leveling up. However it was still very satisfying becoming incredibly strong and quickly destroying most enemies. I play to replay on the hardest difficulty which does allow for leveling and keeps you at level 1.\n\nThis was a crowdfunded game with multiple delays, however the passion behind it is apparent and the game was worth the wait. I could barely stop playing Bloodstained once I started. Easily one of my favorite games this year.",Recommended

"Pros:\n- Looks great! The graphics and animations are just stunning to say the least\n- Music! Oh man, the music just gives you an eargasm\n- A lot of ways to do combat\n- Many new features like crafting and upgrading\n- Alternate endings\n- Extremely easy to learn but the monsters will become extremely difficult at some point in time as you progress\n- The RNG will not make you pull your hair out of frustration like some other games I know\n- The female protagonist has great assets ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)\n\nCons:\n- Requires a game controller. Trust me, I can't play it on a keyboard and mouse.\n- Can't play smoothly on my potato laptop. Although I can still run it, it wouldn't be what you can call playable. I now play it on my gaming rig.\n\nI ignored this game at first when it came out on Steam because I didn't know much about it. All I knew back then was that it was a side scrolling platform game that copied many ideas from the Castlevania I knew from my childhood. I wasn't very much interested in those kinds of games right now because I preferred Triple A titles that pushed my gaming rig to its limits. I felt that I invested a lot on this gaming rig so I should make full use of it and play those games that I couldn't play before because potato.\n\nIt was only when I learned that it would be the ""spiritual successor"" to my beloved Castlevania: Symphony of the Night that I took some time to look at the trailers and stuff. Eventually, I decided to play it and right off the bat, I sensed that something was wrong. I learned that I couldn't play it smoothly without a controller. Those combos like Down, Down-Right, Right, Attack are easy to do with an analog stick. I couldn't consistently do it on a keyboard (I know, I know. Me Noob. I know). So I decided to buy a $43 PS4 Dualshock controller. Imagine that, I paid thrice what I paid for the game just to be able to play it. It was worth it anyway. Now, I can play all the other games I struggled to play before when I didn't have a controller.\n\nRight now, almost 70 hours in and I'm almost at lvl 100 and have completed all the achievements. It was really fun. I didn't expect to be playing that long for a game like this. There's just so many things to do here.\n\nTL:DR Just buy the game, you wont regret it.",Recommended
"Goty material, but I'am biased because of nostalgia.",Recommended

"I've always been a big fan of these games, and this one did not let me down. If you enjoyed the type of Castlevania that Symphony of the Night, and it's sequels on the GBA and DS were, then you will definitely like this. If I had to compare it more directly to any of them, I'd say structurally it's very much like Symphony of the Night, but with elements of Dawn of Sorrow thrown in with the shards. (It's just like collecting the souls in Aria and Dawn).\n\nNot only that, but this game was really, really addicting, at least to me. As for the technical side, I never encountered any crashes or problems like that. The only oddities I found were item drops sometimes getting stuck in places where I couldn't grab them, and sometimes a random frame rate dip during heavy spells that was rare, and try as I might, I couldn't replicate it; it would just happen the few times that it did, sometimes with less activity on screen. Like I mentioned though, these were rare and the framerate problem had to have occurred at least only 5-6 times tops in all the time I played. \n\nI know a lot of Metroid/Castlevania-like games have come around in recent years but to me, none of them capture the feel that I was looking for. With that said, I hope we don't have the same time to wait for another one of these as we had since Order of Ecclesia came out on the DS. (About 11 years). I hope this game does well and gets the sequels it deserves. Rest assured, this is not a Mighty No 9 situation where a prolific designer just churns out an uninspired game after making money on his reputation alone; this is the real deal and easily would have come directly from Konami if they were still making these games, and if Koji Igarashi was still working there. \n\n",Recommended

If you are into these type of these it is a 100% a must have.",Recommended
"Did you enjoy all the Castlevania games, but are disappointed that Konami stopped making them? The people behind such classics are still making games, namely this gem, which is an open love letter to Symphony of the Night and its successors, and Bloodstained: Circle of the Moon, which hearkens to the NES and SNES era Castlevanias.\nIt's not just nostalgia either, they build on existing formulas, while remaining Recommended to the spirit of their inspirations. The result is a blend of old and new that doesn't feel like it came out in 1997, but instead captures the experience that made you love the original, and updates to the times.\n\nI cannot recommend this game more highly.",Recommended
"It's the Castlevania game everybody wanted for the past decade.\n\nIt's like if Order of Ecclesia and Aria of Sorrow had a baby, and gave him to his godfather Symphony of the Night.

"An absolute treat to play! Most definitely one of 2019's Game of the year , in my opinion. Really took my time with it and attempted to get everything in the game in which I clocked in at 47 hours of game time for one playthrough. I recommend not trying to get everything in the first normal playthrough however as it is too easy on normal. It's a flawed gem, with issues relating to some bugs which may be game breaking, I didn't experience it in my game but it's definitely something you want to keep an eye on so keep multiple saves just in case. Other issues pertain to game progression which may sometimes be obscur and obtuse like in specific items needed to continue the game hidden in place you wouldn’t expect. I didn’t mind that much cos of the internets and stuff (yeah I did done looked up a guide ;P) but it was frustrating when I did hit those points and the game does hint to you where you might find the items you need to progress but it sometimes would tell me AFTER I had already gotten the items. The story… is really not the vocal point of the game, but was entertaining to watch either way, a campy gothic melodrama for the ages really. \n\nI feel like those are the main issues the game has but overall I loved every minute of it from the gameplay, the art (which some people dispute as being bad but I like it) and the soundtrack for sure. It is a Castlevania game from start to finish. (It was so good that I stumped up cash for the IGA returns dlc to support the developers so that must so something) \n",Recommended

"Disclaimer: I received this game as a Kickstarter backer.\n\nBloodstained: Ritual of the Night is not just the game I wanted it to be.  It's the game I needed it to be.  See, after the disaster of Mighty No. 9 and the (in my opinion) tepid wards-and-all Yooka-Laylee, it was up to the last of the 'big three' to prove that nostalgia-fueled games by people who worked on fondly-remember series could actually work.  Boy, does Bloodstained work.  It's the perfect fusion of modern advancements with the bits that made SotN-era Castlevania games good.\n\nI struggle to come up with any serious complaints with the game.  My biggest would probably be one of the final areas of the game.  It's a pain to navigate, feels lazy, and I personally feel the music there is the worst in the game.  On a technical note, I strongly recommend turning off Framerate Smoothing (and optionally V-Sync).  The game ran much smoother across the board with that disabled.\n\nReally, there's not much to say.  If you've been jonesing for a Metroidvania, this is _the_ place to go.

The only thing that they'll hopefully fix is I have to window the game and drag it to the correct monitor each time I start it up. Hopefully a monitor select will be added soon.,Recommended
"Very Short Review:\n\nExtremely SoTN esque, which should be obvious when the creator of this, worked on it anyway. Very good gameplay, variety of weapons, the demon shards are cooler than hell, and not to mention the familiars being way better, and way more useful than they were in SoTN. \nThe music is phenomenal, definitely on par with SoTH, which is what I expect from a game trying to emulate Castlevania. Jamming out with the music throughout the game definitely helps you push through the searching of areas in the map.\n\nFinal point. David Hayter is a legend. That is all, 10/10.\n",Recommended
"Really fun outstanding game Koji did an amazing job at constructing this game can play for hours and hours. It's worth getting if you love any of his work like Castlevania Symphony of the night it has it all familiars and just like Castlevania HD with Soma you can take the soul shards in this game and use it to benefit you. Beautiful backgrounds and camera angles of moving with you, you can feel the immersion with it. Recommend it 10/10",Recommended

"Since Steam wants me to review a game for their event thingy, might as well do this one... right?\n\nAfter completing my initial run of this game, I think it's safe to say that this is definitely the return of Metroidvania gameplay that I had been waiting for with much anticipation. The game takes elements from the gameplay of both of the best Castlevania games, Symphony of the Night and Aria of Sorrow, but doesn't take so much from either that this iteration simply becomes a retread of old territory. Instead, the game builds upon the basis of each and creates something that is just as intuitive and engaging as the previously mentioned titles, yet is very much it's own game. Overall, if you're looking for a new Metroidvania game to play and have already exhausted all your options (Heck you, should still play it even if you haven't played other Metroidvanias), then look no further.",Recommended
"Symphony of the Night/Aria of Sorrow 2.0. Fluid controls, countless weapons and play-styles, over 100 unique enemies, plenty of fun bosses, vast interconnected world with tons of secrets. This is the castlevania game we've wanted for years.",Recommended
Feels like classic Castlevania brought into the modern era. Gotta love it :),Recommended
"If you're a fan of Koji Igarashi's works, you will probably enjoy this game very much.",Recommended
This is Symphony of the Night 2. If that statement excites you then you should purchase this game immediately.,Recommended
"Finally, a Kickstarter success!",Recommended
bretty gud,Recommended
"If you ever enjoyed Symphony of the Night or the GBA sequels, this game is an absolute must get. If you only played other Metroidvaina games, it might come off as disjointed. You might not get the hype, and the gameplay might feel uneven or even out of date by modern standards. However it's still gives credit to it's predecessors that helped start the genre.\n\nIf you've never played Metroidvaina game, play at your own risk. The game can be difficult, especially since the game does not always directly tell you where to go, and exploring will require the use of abilities that can only be acquired from basic mobs, and even though their use may not be 100% obvious.\n\nI was a backer for the Kickstarter, and I am satisfied with the final product. I look forward to all the future updates that will build on top of the replayability of the game.\n\n10/10",Recommended
One of the finest Metroidvania games ever created.,Recommended
I'm in love,Recommended
I'm surprised how much I enjoy this game. Its definitely a must have for people who enjoy Metroidvania type games.,Recommended

"If you know and like all the 2d igavania abbreviations, add ROTN to the list and you are unlikely to be disappointed.\nYou can keep the game as simple or as broken as you like, just as intended.\nSave often though, through 40+ hours of playing, I've encountered 3 instances of having to ALT F4. \n1. Getting stuck in menu after changing shards\n2. Stuck after a screen transition while directional casting (can't do anything and enemies would go through me)\n3. A permablack loading screen with music playing.\nThis game involves alot of farming in the late stage, so avoid tears and save often in case of crashes in a long farming run.\nLooking forward to the roguelike feature the most\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1774149810",Recommended

There are so many mechanics and this game is amazing! :)",Recommended

"Hi everyone!  This will be quick.  I have put in a calm 13 hours (and 13% complete lol) so far and I have been loving it!  This has scratched my Metrovania itch quite nicely.  Graphics 5/5, Sound 4/5, Gameplay 5/5 and Funfactor 5/5.  I very happy with my purchase and look to support more like this in the future.",Recommended
This is a great followup to Castlevania: Symphony of the Night.  I only wish it was a longer game.,Recommended
Great Game,Recommended
"They delivered what they where promising, completely solid.",Recommended
Yes.\nGood Game.\nOccasional bugs with items and bosses.\n\nWould recommend.,Recommended
"Metroidvania is back, just buy it.",Recommended
"It is very refreshing for a game like this to come around. A lot of people are comparing this to Castlevania Symphony of the Night, which is actually a fair comparison. This game is one of my favorite games of the year so far. It hits all the right nostalgia notes with a modern twist and it keeps pulling me back to play more. I couldn't recommend this enough. I wouldn't be put off by the price which some people have an issue with because their is a lot going on in this game. If anything I would argue there is more in this than in most $60 AAA games nowadays. It's a labor of love this one.",Recommended
"Highly polished follow-up to Glorious SotN. \nWorthy of the hours. Cant wait for co-op!\n\nA: 9/10 - Awesome jams. Sometimes too epic for whats going on.\nV: 9/10 - Could be better but for what it is meant to be it's great.\nStory: 4/10 - Something something whatever. Just let me smash!!!!\n Overall: 8.5 - Great game, worth the time and the money. \n",Recommended
"Just like the castlevania's for the gameboy advance, exactly what its being promoted, loving it so far.",Recommended
This game is excellent. It makes me reminisce about the old days playing Symphony of the Night on Playstation for very long periods of time. Its great exploring the new castle area and doing quests. But the map has some areas that are almost the same areas as SotN. It like a modern SotN with its own story. Highly recommended!,Recommended
"I backed this game several years ago and can safely say I have no regrets about having done such. The game, while not flawless, has been nothing but fun for me. If you're a fan of metroidvania games and want one more akin to the Soma CV games, then this is a good choice.",Recommended
"Excellent Metroidvanaia game. If you want to play Symphony of the night with better graphics, now is your chance.",Recommended
"I don't even know where to start, this is precisely the way that a spiritual successor of Castlevania: Symphony of the Night should be created.\n\nEasily a 10/10 game, deserves your money.",Recommended
"Bloodstained is probably exactly what you'll be expecting if you loved games like Castlevania: Symphony of the Night. Being a spiritual successor, it hits all the right notes. While there are some graphical complaints and glitches, overall the game is smooth and fun to play. There are plenty of different weapons and ways to customize Miriam, and thus far, the voice acting has been well done.",Recommended

It was worth the wait . Metroidvania fans will enjoy this.,Recommended
"As someone who LOVED Castlevania: Symphony of the night, and spent the longest time searching for another metroidvania with the same level of IMMERSIVENESS, charm, and overall feel (all the usual popular ones coming up short, imo), Bloodstained surpassed every expectation I could've had. Not only is the map huge, explorable, and varied, but the vast amount of customization options, from equipment to enemy ability shards (akin to Aria/Dawn of Sorrow) make sure that everyone can play the game differently. Not only that, but 13 imminent free DLCs are going to expand the content EVEN MORE. Definitely worth it.",Recommended
Lots of fun.  Graphically gorgeous.  Handles well.  Well worth the price.,Recommended
It's like Dawn of Sorrow but you're playing as Shanoa.\n\nAlso it's really good!,Recommended
"It has been a long time since I had such a major issue with a game. I was stuck on the main menu for nearly five minutes, unable to do anything at all!\n\nI guess when you have Michiru Yamane as composer for the soundtracks, you can get away with that. Yes, I was literally struck speechless and into total immobility when I heard the opening song in the main menu. It was THAT good.\n\nGrowing up, one of my most cherished memories was playing Castlevania: Symphony of the Night. Nearly twenty years later, Bloodstained can easily be considered a Recommended addition to Koji Igarashi's legacy.\n\nThe references to so many Castlevania elements, the use of voice actors such as Robert Belgrade as an edgy, long-white-haired vampire, the little things like the inclusion of two weapons that attack multiple times per swing and can be used while moving, the divine music ... Suffice to say that if you ever enjoyed Castlevania, you should pick up Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night.\n\nSome doom-mongering halfwits who said this game was going to be another Mighty No. 9, but...\n\nWhat is a doom-mongering halfwit but a miserable little pile of negativity? But enough talk. Buy this game!",Recommended
This game is every bit as good as I'd hope it would be when it was a concept on Kickstarter. This game has many high points and is a Recommended spiritual successor to the Castlevania series. To name a few: Voice acting is very good. Combat is fluid and impactful (and omg there are so many types of weapons you can use. It's insane!) It has replayability with different 2 characters as of Now. The music is fantastic as well.\n\nIf you've played Castlevania symphony of the night (One of most well-known Koji Igarash masterpieces) Then you will feel right at home with this masterpiece. There are many references to that title as well that fans will get a kick out of and remember! I would recommend this to any fan of Castlevania or… “metroidvania” games. \n,Recommended
Worth the wait and worth the buy\nif you like metroidvania games then pick this one up!,Recommended

"It was a bit difficult at first, I got my butt kicked by bats, rats and ants and everyone!\nNow I am overpowered and I LOVE IT!\n\nBEWARE! No auto saves! You have to find save points and save manually. You can also save and quit at any time, should you need to go take care of something irl.\n\nSo many tools and weapons and skills and shards... etc.\nSo many secrets and unlockables.\nSo many places to sit!\nSo many paintings to smash!\nSo many types of enemies!\nSo many types of food to cook!\nSo many candle sticks and lanterns to shatter to pieces!\n\nI have 50% of the map cleared, and I got one of the endings. bit meh. Probably not the Recommended ending. I immediately loaded my last save and went on a different route.\n\nSpecial thanks to my friend Drumjod, for giving me tips and getting me back into the game :)",Recommended
Awesome game!  Feel's like playing Castlevania: SOTN all over again!,Recommended
"A really good iga-vania game. Well worth the wait after the kickstarter campaign. A little buggy still, but generally only small visual bugs. The crafting system is good, and there is a good variety of weapons and spells to play with.",Recommended
Everything and a bag of chips.\nOne of the best games of the Summer. Pick this up.,Recommended
"OK, let's get the objectively bad stuff out of the way:\n\n1) They pronounce the name ""Johannes"" with a hard ""J"" instead of a soft ""Y,"" which is maybe correct in British English, but not to anyone else on the planet, which sounds weird. It's ""YO-Han-Ness,"" dang it. \n\n2) Basically the game ignores Curse of the Moon ever happening I think? So if you were hoping that was a prequel in anything other than as a preview of some of the upcoming characters/enemies/bosses, it ain't. Sorry fanfic writers. \n\n. . . and that's about it. The rest is absolute gold.\n\nSeriously, this game is everything it should be. A perfect Igavania style game that is the culmination of numerous iterative mechanics introduced into the Castlevania series from Symphony of the Night on through Order of Ecclesia (especially since Miriam, the main character, bears a heavy debt to that game's protagonist, Shanoa). It doesn't so much evolve anything seen before in various games by Koji Igarashi, but it does add a few new handy features, particularly a very helpful quick change option that lets you keep several different equipment/magic builds on hand for different situations, which helps save a lot of needless time in menus. \n\nHighly recommended assuming you like any kind of well made Metroidvania, or even just want a well produced 2D action/exploration game.",Recommended

"One of my big personal contenders of GOTY, I absolutely love all aspects of Bloodstained, not just the  combat, the excellent crafting system, build making and world exploration. \n\nAfter getting my head in the game, I was able to clear all of the main story without checking the internet for tips. After you force yourself to mess around in the castle not knowing what to do,trying out new skills and what they do, it really makes you feel nostalgic. It transports you back to a time where internet availability was limited. You had to talk to your buddies over the phone (hard line, not cellphones) or check the local newstand for a gaming magazine and see if they had a new issue with the tips you needed.\n\nThis game was made to make you feel back in the 90's. It certainly did it for me. Let's face it: outside of Nightmare, the game is not that challenging. I played my first playthrough on hard and the only real difficulty I felt was figuring out how to get around the castle. THATS the real challenge of the game here, because the game NEVER holds your hand. There's only ever a short dialogue, and that's it. You're supposed to work with a few lines of dialog and your wits. And when you do clear a challenge, you feel good about yourself, because you were able to get inside the game's logic of how that world works.\n\nOutside the level design (which is SOTN level of ingenious and gorgeous), the combat is so fluent and rich. There are so many ways you can build your character. Customization is off the charts here. You can literally switch between entire builds on the go, that means DURING COMBAT. That's only to name a few.\n\nThe story is better than the standard Castlevania, has it's twists and turns, but that's not even the point here. In this game, the castle is the main character. The more you explore it, the more you get to know about the world, the characters and, surprisingly, the creator himself, and his struggles creating the game. Each area is absolutely fantastic. You can feel the sheer love of the developers just pouring out of each pixel. I cant believe that a low budget kickstarter campaign of just a few people could produce a AAA game of 40+ hours of content guaranteed.\n\nAs a longtime fan of SOTN, I believed in Iga's vision of the future for games like these. I was glad I backed Bloodstained and got to be at least a tiny part of it's creation.",Recommended
Love it. Old school cool.,Recommended

"Let me me preface this review by addressing the negatives first, of which there are a few. Yes, the game's visuals are not outstanding, but they are still very serviceable, specially after the first few areas. Yes, the cutscenes are atrocious, particularly in camera work. And yes, the story is very predictable and simple.\n\nNow that I'm done complaining, let me tell you this:\nThis is the Castlevania game you've been waiting for. \nKoji Igarashi (the game's director) must be pretty proud of this one.\n\nAside from those few grievances, the rest of the game is completely amazing.\nThe soundtrack is a joy to listen to and really captures that Symphony of the Night feel. Speaking of SotN, this game has a lot of ties to it, down to the ""jump, attack in mid-air, land mid-attack, cancelling the attack animation and allowing you to immediately attack again"". Which is great, because SotN is amazing as well. Miriam controls nicely, and when you master her moveset you can quickly traverse the castle with ease. The castle itself is similar to other Castlevanias' castles, in that there is an underground water area, a garden-type of area, a high towers area, etc.\n\nSotN parallels aside, this game is packed with content. The castle is huge; there are tons of secrets, tons of items, and tons of monsters, which results in tons of shards (unique powers) to collect.\n\nThe overall gameplay is what you would expect from a Castlevania game, if not better.\n\nI'm getting tired of writing this review, so I'll just say this:\nIf you ever were a Castlevania fan, do buy this game, please.\nIf you've never played a Castlevania-like game before, this is the perfect opportunity to see if you'll like it.",Recommended

"Can look like ass sometimes but still an incredible game. \n\nEvery enemy has a chance to drop a shard (the spell system in bloodstained) which means there is boatloads of customisation combined with the absurd amount of weapons (which have hidden techniques that use fighting game inputs to do special moves).\n\nThere is a fair amount of backtracking and working out which areas you've unlocked thanks to the sweet new ability you just got, but that is kinda par for the course for this genre.",Recommended
"This game pretty much picks up exactly where [i]Castlevania: Order of Ecclesia[/i] left off back in 2008. It's classic IGAvania in all but name, no grand experiments, no significant changes to the formula. That means that some of its appeal does come from nostalgia factor alone, but aside from a few unrefined elements, the formula also simply hasn't aged too badly. For the average [i]Castlevania[/i] fan of yore, this should be a no-brainer. There is a good amount of pandering in there, but it's very tongue-in-cheek for the most part. So, no real complaints overall. It's more of the same, and that's a good thing. There's always room for new ideas in a sequel.",Recommended
"Great game, if you like Castlevania SOTN then you'll like this one.",Recommended
"Let me say that Sotn will always be my favorite castlevania game, but bloodstained is a little better.  All the stuff i loved about sotn is in here and then some. Unlike most AAA games today this one wasn't just half baked and rushed out the door.  It has a FULL game in here (i add this part because i was debating for a while if i should get the game or not for this reason). it doesn't have just the bare minimum, it has all you want and more in there. so to answer your questions you might have with no spoilers. it has familiars (one has a little bit of a gimmick i loved), it doesn't have the spells like sotn but you can take enemy's power like in aria of sorrow (but fleshed out a bit better), it has equipment like sotn, its sound track is great, really good art, mild customization, and some fun little hidden things. The Castle size is some where between 100% and 200%(if you got the good ending you will know what i mean) of Sotn (i would say 160%). It just feels like the love song that sotn deserved.",Recommended
"Even though many indie titles have come out since the last Metroidvania Castlevania games to iterate on the foundations that series had set for the genre, it's good to just have what's basically a Metroidvania Castlevania game back with all of the soul and quirk that's been sorely missing.",Recommended
"Great game, I enjoy every minute of it.",Recommended
"TLDR = If you're a fan of classic, side-scrolling ""Metroidvania"" or the aesthetics of old-school Castlevania games, this is a real treat.  Also, its existence being a joyfully-spiteful spit in the eye of Konami is delicious.\n\n\nAs a fan of Castlevania since the 8-bit days, I absolutely love this game.  It's positively dripping with ""gothic horror"" style, and hearkens back to Castlevania's of old, most notably the famous ""Symphony of the Night"", on which the driving creative force of this game, Koji Igarashi (or IGA as he is known) worked as a major dev.\n\nGameplay-wise, it consists of side-scroller platforming with weapon- and spell-based combat, a huge map to explore and fill in, various skills and abilities to unlock, secrets to find, and lots of RPG-style equipment to collect and swap through.  The huge variety of weapon types and spells you can find create a massive variety of combat styles, from ranged guns to daggers and swords to huge axes and Castlevania-classic whips, and more.  The ""shards"" you find give you a huge arsenal of spells to improve and upgrade, as well, to support your weapons and even to help you progress through the map.\n\nThe dark and atmospheric environments are combined with colorful characters and beautiful art pieces, as though you really were exploring a gothic castle or a massive mega-cathedral, and also features a smattering of steampunk elements here and there for flavor.  The music flows from sweeping and grand to haunting and serene and gives me such wonderful Castlevania vibes to a T.\n\nThe enemies are nice and varied, as well, with lots of new twists on classic monster types and industry-staple frustrating flying things.  The bosses are classic pattern-learning puzzles, usually mopping the floor with you at least once or twice before you get a handle on it, but they're also a gorgeous and gruesome spectacle, as they should be.\n\nPersonally, I found quite a bit of joy in just how Konami-but-not this game is, after being frustrated for years at the decisions and handling of their best franchises and best talent.  This game is like a giant middle-finger at them, and it shows, right down to very obvious references to their properties, and even David Hayter of MGS fame voicing one of the principle characters.  More power to them, I say.\n\nJust of note, the designs of some of the female characters is a tad on the cheesecake side, so whether that's a plus or a minus for you, be aware that it's in there.  Regardless, Miriam's a major badass, and I'd be glad to play more games featuring her in the future.",Recommended
"Amazing game, I haven't been able to put it down.",Recommended
great game! I am new to the Genre but i had a blast.,Recommended
"Not perfect but, on the whole, all we were promised. If you like the genre then it's a must play.",Recommended
Good Metroidvenia game from the creator of Castlevania Symphony of the Night.\nA bit grindy though if you want all the shards.,Recommended
"it's just like the handheld castlevania games, definitely buy it",Recommended
"pretty good game\ngameplay is fun, graphics are beautiful, story is interesting enough and the music is amazing\n\nBUT\n\nit has a flawed progression where you will be pretty much unable to unlock all the fun stuff til you finish the game, and lategame turns you into a murder machine with anything else to do than just farm archievements\n\nhopefully the next updates will add up to it!",Recommended
Scratches that Igavania itch and then some. Works great on Linux/Proton too.,Recommended
"I would highly recommend this game. The aesthetic, combat variety, leveling and loot system feels very rewarding.\nThere are over 120 weapons and many weapon types, there are also over 120 spells (shards), and leveling/grinding feels nice and impactful. I had not played this genre of game before but I am really glad I gave the game a chance. TIP: If you want to be challenged try playing on nightmare first.",Recommended
"Excellent time killer.  Plays very similar to Castlevania, Symphony of the Night. It's been a long time since I have played a good metroidvania and I can't recommend this game enough",Recommended
"Bloodstained is the best Metroidvania-style game since Symphony of the Night. It has less-memorable music and less boss fights, but the crafting, shard system, and level design adds so much more to the game. I hope to see a sequel in the future. If you are a big fan of SOTN, just buy this title! You won't regret it.",Recommended
This game allows me to hit many buttons in quick succession and go slighty faster than not doing that. Two thumbs up.,Recommended
"Super fun and is the literal reincarnation of the much lost but amazing Castlevania series made by none other than the original creator himself. Feels like Castlevania: dawn of sorrow with a bit of SOTN, and RONDO OF BLOOD mixed in.\n\nCombat is astounding with many ways to choose how you want to play with the shard system and weapon types. There are a few optional bosses that really take a beating to beat plus some really neat references and easter eggs to other franchises woven in.\n\nExperience a story that's Recommended to its predecessors and have an awesome time slaying demons as Miriam the Shardbinder, through breath taking levels with overwhelmingly catchy background music, the game manages to make you feel super powerful but still keeps the difficulty in check so you can equally feel just as weak.\n\nBe warned sometimes the game will RANDOMLY FREEZE and you will have to force close it (not sure if this is a wide known problem at the moment) but save frequently to combat the issue until it's patched.\n\nLastly, CASTLEVANIA IS BACK BOIZ",Recommended

"Very entertaining game! Really well made and fun to spend time with. If you've never played symphony of the night and have always wanted to, this is a great game to start with.",Recommended
"(Disclaimer - I am a $60 backer)\n\nThis is a great callback to old Metroidvania games - more specifically, Castlevania Aria of Sorrow and Dawn of Sorrow. There's a lot of fun to be had in this game. Stable framerate, tight controls, and satisfying ways to traverse the map and fight enemies. Story's formulaic, but it has some twists here and there. All in all, I had fun, and if you like Metroidvanias, you won't go wrong with this.",Recommended
Castlevania: Symphony of the Night 2.  Enough said.,Recommended
"Ahhh how I missed the joy of the Igavanias. SoTN was, is and most likely will remain a masterpiece and is a game I play every once in a while and never gets dull or boring. The GBA and DS castlevanias were also great but they just didnt have that SoTN feel and replayability that SoTN had. \n\nFINALLY... after waiting soe 4 years... we get a beautiful SoTN sequel that will hopefully infuriate lameass KONAMI for their stupidity and greed. \n\nIf you enjoyed any of the castlevania games this game will not disappoint. Beautiful graphics with an amazing musical score complemented by an addictive and superbly refined gameplay that will have you sinking in hours upon hours of time and enjoying every minute of it. \n\nPS - Puts that HK game that got hella overhyped to shame.",Recommended
"I got a few more side quests to wrap up before I beat the game, may as well finish them up for completions sake.\n\n\n~8 hours later...\n\nI have become a god, very little can hurt me and whatever can hurt me can be instantly healed up, I can delete entire rooms in mere seconds without consuming any mana, and I move impossibly fast with accelerator, and yet despite all of this, I still CANNOT FIND THE FUCKING PASTA RECIPE IN THIS CASTLE!",Recommended
If you really like castlevania games with the style of metroidvania you will love this game. The weapons feel the same with the exception of the whip sadly it seems Miriam is not that skilled with it like the Belmonts. Apart of that is good. The map is big and with a diversity similar to the other castlevania games. It also has the soul mechanic from Aria and Dawn of Sorrow which it was a great mechanic although it still missing at the time of this review of the coop mode which could have made the game more fun. The music it's okay although castlevania have a better soundtrack but I think is more for the nostalgic effect. I wish it had more maps that use the 2.5D style for a great presentation like the tower but overall it is okay!,Recommended
Excellent and beautifully made in classic the classic 2-D Castlevania style. Hits the right balance of nostalgia and familiarity with new mechanics and surprises to keep genre veterans interested.,Recommended
Best MetroidVania game since Symphony of the Night,Recommended
"This game is amazing. Although there may be areas where you may get lost without guidance, the fundamental gameplay and enjoyment this game brings is a breathe of fresh air.  This game has it all. Leveling, action, grinding for items, crafting, unique abilities/spells.  It has been a long time since I played a unique and classic metroidvania game and this game delivers.  The beginning is a little slow, but once you get past the first few bosses the game picks up pace.",Recommended
"Good game, not much to say if you want a solid metrovania this is the game.\n\nFor note, you can most chest if you dropkick on an enemy or a torch.\n\nThe negative,\nAlot of farming needed for about evenything.\nGem drops (your main spells and passive) drop way too low.\nMost updrade (for gems) you can only rank max at the last 1-2 of the game (need monster drops).",Recommended
Is very good game.,Recommended
Konami should hire this man,Recommended
"[h1]Welcome to the Robot Maid Review of Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night[/h1]\n\nDisclosure: I am a backer of Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night.\n\nBloodstained: Ritual of the Night is a Metroidvania created by the man widely regarded as the father of modern Castlevania, Koji Igarashi. It's a very solid game with few flaws in a time where modern games are constantly inundated with obnoxious business practices or low quality assurance.\n\nThe game opens with Miriam on the Galleon Minerva sailing toward a demonic castle that had spontaneously been summoned and started spreading demons across the world. From there, you meet up with your friends and allies to make your way through the castle to defeat the one who summoned it, Miriam's friend Gebel. While the story isn't an amazing one that will stick with you for ages after completion, it serves its purpose nicely, clearly laying out Miriam's motivation for starting her journey through the castle.\n\nNote: I played this game with a Dualshock 4. While this game does not have native Dualshock 4 support, Steam's controller settings can be used to allow use of Dualshock 4s without third party software.\n\nFrom there, you get a taste of the controls, which are incredibly solid. Buttons are responsive and the game feels very good to control. As you make your way through the castle, you gain new abilities such as a Double Jump that allow you to traverse areas of the castle you were unable to access before. Each ability gained is streamlined rather well. Furthermore, there are (not-so) hidden techniques that inform you how to use special abilities with certain weapon types. While these techniques can only be used by specific weapons at first, mastering them allows you to use them with any weapon of the same type.\n\nThere's a plethora of hidden items to find, many demons to hunt, and many abilities to learn. Many of which are incredibly fun and satisfying to use, ranging from throwing axes to summoning a giant metal fist to punch your enemies.\n\nWhile there are many weapons and abilities that are fun to use, unfortunately they are not balanced well. Some weapon types feel weak overall (like the Whip or Spears). Even though some weapons and abilities feel relatively weak, they are still fun to use however.\n\nThe game starts off rather difficult, but as you gain more abilities and weapons, you find yourself getting very strong, very fast. The late game is significantly easier than early game because of how much stronger you can get, to the point that you can double your attack speed, move faster, have significantly higher defense with a decent chance of outright negating damage all together.\n\nAfter you beat the game once, you open up NG+ and Hard mode, which add enemies and increase their stats, which increases replay value, but it's not necessary to get all the achievements. For further challenge, there's also Nightmare mode, which reduces your level cap to 1, essentially forcing a handicap on yourself. There's plenty of replay value to be had.\n\nNot to mention there's upcoming (free) DLC for the game which will further boost the game's longevity.\n\nThe sound design is amazing, with the music setting the tone of each individual section of the castle and having a good amount of energy in the places where it's needed, or calming when it needs to be. Sound effects all convey the action on the screen very well too, making it even clearer what's going on.\n\nHowever, the game is not perfect. There are a few bugs and I encountered a crash at one point (I have not been able to replicate it however). Hitboxes and hurtboxes feel deceptively large or small in very few instances. But these problems are very small drops in a large pond.\n\nThis game is definitely worth a look if you like the genre. The logical conclusion of what Castlevania should have become and with all the positive reception, proves that there's a place for this sort of game in the world.\n\nThis has been a Robot Maid Review. I thank you for reading, and I hope to see you again.",Recommended

This take me back to my young when I used to play earlier Castlevania games.\n\nI would recommend this just for nostalgia sake.\n\nThe good news is that there is more to this game than just nostalgia.\n\nEdit: I would also recommend playing this game with a controller as I am not used to using this specific keyboard layout.,Recommended
"IGA is back guys!!! \nFantastic game, loved the music the combat the bosses and there are still a lot of FREE dlc to come.\nBUY THIS GAME!!",Recommended

"If you're looking for Iga's particular brand of metroidvania, you will not be disappointed.\n\nLimited abilities earlier on make the game seem a bit slower and clunkier than typical Iga-vanias, but late game it picks up and has just as much gameplay flow as SoTN or Ecclesia with as much player character customization as any Metroivania I've seen.\n\nBe warned there are some non-typical/questionable progression sources. If you're not given to the exploration side of Metroidvanias, you may wind up lost for hours trying to find a missing key or lock to move forward.",Recommended
Honestly this game is great.  This is the perfect blend old SOTN with new and fun mechanics.  My one and ONLY gripe is the bosses are kinda easy.  Other than that the game is great!,Recommended
"I absolutely loved this game. The boss battles were great, along with the music. I was happy to see something more on the ""vania-side"" of the metroidvania moniker.",Recommended
"What is konami ? \nA miserable little pile of avarice.\nBut enough talk, buy this game !",Recommended

"Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night is the Recommended successor to the Castlevania series that I was hoping it would be.\n\n    I may have only ever played Circle of the Moon, Symphony of the Night, and Aria of Sorrow, but if you enjoyed those games then I promise you that this game is an evolution of them all, and seems to have been specifically crafted for the fans. Animation skips, monster souls, tons of gear and even special input moves, they've even got medals for perfect boss clears for those of you who want to have proof of your skill.\n\nI can't recommend this game enough, please scrape together some street change and throw it at this game so we can see this team prosper and create more great works.",Recommended

"Do you like CastleVania: Aria of Sorrow and CastleVania: Symphony of the Night? If the answer is yes, then you should probably just stop reading this and buy the game. It is basically exactly those games, but Alucard wears a dress. Note that this is not a complaint. It is more an indication of the game is exactly what you want if you're a fan of the SOTN-styled Metroidvania genre.",Recommended
"Honestly If you loved any of the late Metroidvanias, you will love this game. \nIf you're a fan of all the Castlevania ones you will love retrieving all those little easter eggs (subtle or not) and hommages to his predecessors. \nIn short if you like this genre, there's no way you should skip this fabulous game, it's not perfect but it's filled with kindness.\n\nF*ck Konami ! \n\nWith love, an Iga fan.",Recommended
"If you liked Castlevania: Symphony of the Night, then you will probably like this.  If you don't like SotN then you will probably not like this.  Overall I would recommend this game.  I give it a B.\n\nWhat is lowering the grade is the bosses seem to either be a cakewalk or an actual challenge.  You won't know until you first fight them.  The placement of the transporters and save spots could use some better positioning.  The last issue is it can be confusing where to go to next.  I am not sure how you would find the Recommended ending without help from outside the game.",Recommended

Is good,Recommended
"This game manages to be a faithful homage while still boasting its own incredible strengths.\nFor any fans of 'Castlevania: Symphony of the Night,"" its hard to imagine a better treat.\n\nSome reasons I have fallen in love with the game:\n - A mesmerizing soundtrack by Michiru Yamane, with the familiar haunting gothic style we love from Castlevania!\n - Excellent graphic and visual design. This game is very easy on the eyes!\n - Controls are tight, responsive, and clever. Combat is such a joy, and the game offers many opportunities to be skilled and stylish.\n - Secrets are around every corner! The game rewards those who explore carefully and thoroughly.\n - A ""New Game +"" system as well as multiple difficulties promise a long game life. \n\n\nI think to be fair, I should list a few personal criticisms:\n\n - It is difficult not to compare the game to Castlevania, which was known for it's over-dramatic style, almost like an opera. A character like Dracula afforded much gravitas and charisma, and the drama surrounding him lends itself to a more dreadful and gothic aesthetic. Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night does it's best to achieve a similar atmosphere, but with the added handicap of building a new world and introducing us to a host of new characters - and the streamlined nature of gameplay doesn't allow enough time to develop the same dramatic tenor that the Castlevania games were known for.\n\n - The voice acting sometimes left a bit more to be desired. While the performances themselves are not bad, they don't appear well-grounded in the larger creative vision behind Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night. In some cases, this may be more the fault of a cramped script that is overburdened with explaining the plot.\n\n\nWith that aside, I can still confidently recommend this game. There is some excellent work here, and this is exactly the kind of gem that fans of the Castlevania series have been hoping for.",Recommended
A fantastic Metroidvania game that I could see becoming a classic in the future! A must own!,Recommended
"SOTN sequel without the rights, perfect.",Recommended
Worth the investment 4 years ago. I was worried that it would be another mighty No.9 but I'm glad that it was not. Would invest toward Iga again.,Recommended
"Fantastic Metroidvania. I was a bit worried at first when I heard about this game's Kickstarter history, but it really does live up to expectations. Bloodstained offers an almost overwhelming amount of customization and exploration, as well as some great boss fights and nice (but a bit rough at times) visuals. The story isn't that interesting and the few fully animated cutscenes are stiff, but those aren't the focus and don't take up enough time to drag the game down.",Recommended

"Iga promised a throwback to Castlevanias of old and he delivered. The movement, the music, the grinding for items and shards are all reminiscent of the DS titles so if you liked them, you'll like this one.",Recommended
"Not as good as the classics, but a worthy successor just the same.\n\nI really hate polygons, and while I appreciate all the effort that went into rendering them I still think that high quality sprites would have looked better. There's also no good music to be found in the whole game. \n\nThankfully it plays like a dream--you could drown in the volume of maps, bosses, enemies, items, weapons, secrets, and all that other wonderful shit that I love so damn much from these games. Download a mod to replace those godawful portraits in the background.",Recommended

"Pretty solid game with quite a bit of content packed into it. If you like Metroid/Igavanias in general, this game is right up your alley.\nOther than one section that was slow, this game was pretty face paced and gave quite a bit of challenge even in normal difficulty.\nI'd reccomend buying this game to anyone who's a fan of this genre.",Recommended
"I don't usually write reviews, but this game deserves the marketing. Iga did exactly what he said. He made a quality game up to his standards. He pushed back the release date to ensure it was a quality game. That speaks of the standards he has for this game. The game has plenty to do(crafting, shards, exploration), satisfying gameplay, and music to enjoy while slaying demons. I rarely say this, but I would recommend this game to anyone.",Recommended
"This was my first time playing a metroidvania game and generally thought it was pretty good.\n\nThe first part of the game had a few places with framerate drops and crashed a few times, but after that, it ran really well. The only consistent framerate drops in the game occur in like 2 rooms with trams and constantly spawning enemy spam. Considering I'm running a 1070ti and a cpu to match, there really is no excuse for framerate dropping.\n\nGraphically, it's okay. If you enjoy the graphic style, you'll really like it. For me though, it was merely good enough.\n\nGameplay is where things get good. Controls are tight and consistent and the exploration is enjoyable and rewarding. The enemies offer good variety and I really enjoyed the boss fights.\n\nMy final issue with the game is the end. I don't know if it was a glitch or deliberately stupid, but holy god, the sound at the end made me want to gouge my ears out. I beat the final boss but some loud horrible pulsating grindy sound kept playing, covering up the dialogue and endgame music all the way through the credits. I'd thought my headphones had broke, but once it returned to the title screen, the horrific assault on  my ears came to an end. \n\nOverall, I had a good time with the game. \n",Recommended

"definitely worth a look if you like SotN at all. the main game is pretty short unless you go for grinding out the entire item list, but it's a fun ride. there's a couple points in the game where the breadcrumbs don't really tell you what to do next, and at least once where progress is 100% reliant on you killing a specific enemy to get a specific power-up (and nothing tells you to do this). anyway game is fun, buy it while it's on sale if you weren't a backer.",Recommended
I love this game. It's like playing Symphony of the Night with a JoJo.,Recommended

"If you played Castlevania Symphony of the Night you more than likely enjoy this game. You can see the game directors Koji Igarashi style of design. The game contains multiple tools, powers and items to fit the game play style of many players, I personally enjoy using the Whip and different range Shards power ups. Finding what kind of shards you can get from each enemy makes it a enjoyable experience when it comes to hunting them.\n\nBut now lets go with the Pro's and Con's of the game. WARNING these might be considered spoilers so unless you want a truly blind run then please restrain from reading the Pro and Con of the game.\n\n+ Easy to use and smooth controllers. Even thou there were a few times where I didn't remember which button does what, or 1 time where i didn't understand how to use one of the special acquired skills the game overall is easy to control and understand.\n\n+ Story. The story is just simply there to enhance the game, is nothing big or extraordinary just like your classic Metroidvania games, where is more about the adventure rather than the plot.\n\n+ Gaemplay. Is very straight up your run of the mill Metroidvania style game, where is not so much of traveling new worlds on an epic chase against evil, but rather more of discovering new ways of traversing through vast castle for the sake.\n\n- There were a few sections that I required to use a guide to find the answer, but not in the way you would think. A few of the items required to continue where a Random Drop from a Monster or an Chest Item hidden away somewhere rather than the already standardised Boss Fight Shard Skill. \n\n- Unless you go through multiple weapons, you more than likely will spent a lot of time with the same weapon. I play mostly the whip and there are only 4 or 5 versions of the whip and there really isn't a upgrade system except for the 8bit coin weapons, that even thou they are all craft they required the previous version plus the 16Bit or 32Bit coin.\n\nThere aren't really enough nitpick issues with the game to even call those last ones CON's, game isn't perfect but it is what we were promised which is rare to see from Indy games that starter back years ago from KickStarter. You can see that Iga just had a field trip working on this game even added his favorite ester eggs from previous Castlevania or even Jojo Bizarre Adventure References. Finding this just brings some chuckles. \n\nOverall this game is definitely a must play if you are a huge fan of the Metroidvania genre.",Recommended
"Excellent game, probably the best Metroidvania that has come out in years. It is a given to say that the game is reminiscent of SOTN  and the other RPG-esque Castlevania games considering Iga's hand in it, so if you're a fan of those or never played one and simply wish to enjoy a well made action-RPG then I recommend the game whole heartedly.",Recommended
"Great game, very metroid-vaina and a great blast, found myself losing hours doing backtracking to find every secret there is, and enjoying the combat, wish the crafting system was a little better in showing you the upgrades to weapons you have and seeing what you need, but beside that no complaints",Recommended
Super good,Recommended
The new castlevania we all wanted\n,Recommended
"I love this a ton. Really reminds me of Castlevania: Aria of Sorrow as you take in new powers from defeating enemies. I really love the music and art style that the game went with, the first levels song was a banger and was instantly hooked from then on. I would really recommend this for someone who has either played a Castlevania game before, or wants to get into it. 10/10",Recommended
Very Fun and soo many call backs to Iga's SoTN days with fun easter eggs and even a cameo i didnt expect. Metroidvania game as it should be and for as long as it took to come out i cant wait for more,Recommended
"Been waiting forever for this and even though that may bias me, this game delivers. It's a wonderful story with stunning visuals and a beautiful soundtrack. If you like any of the metroidvania style castlevania games then this one is definitely worth checking out.",Recommended
"Must say, one of if not the best Igavania (definitely top 3) I've ever played. The mad man did it",Recommended
10/10\n\nThere is a lot more to this game than you'd initially think :)\nThe new modes will give this game tons of replay\n\nBloodstained: Waifu of the Night\n\nRecommended successor of\n\nCastlevania: Symphony of the Night,Recommended
"Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night was fun all the way through. The small issues are being fixed already. There's even more free content to come, so you can't go wrong with this one.\n\nCan't wait to play it again twice with new main characters!",Recommended
"If you liked Symphony of the Night or Aria of Sorrow, then you won't want to miss this game. If you never played those Castlevania games before, then give this game a shot. It's a pretty good time.",Recommended
Everything I wanted and more.,Recommended
Amazing...,Recommended
Fantastic game that runs great on PC and is very reminiscent of classic metroidvania games.,Recommended
"A return to form for Castlevania games.\n\nIf you liked games such as Castlevania: Dawn of Sorrow, you will probably like this.\n\nToo bad Konami has the IP locked up, luckily they weren't involved in this game.",Recommended
"A mix between Symphony of the Night, Aria of Sorrow and Order of Ecclesia; like, what more could you want? More of a Castlevania game than Lords of Shadow.",Recommended

"I was weary about getting this game. As kickstarter backed games, in experience, have shown me how crappy they are. \n\nThis....this is how kickstarter projects should go! This is a faithful follow up to Castlevania, EXACTLY what we wanted.\n\nYes. Get this game if you want Castlevania. If that kind of game isn't your style, this game will not change your mind.\n\n9.5 / 10 Near perfect/ which some minor stuttering, etc.",Recommended

I will continue to support, please make more great games. Cheer!!!!",Recommended
Not quite on the same level of the DS vainia titles but very close. I highly recommend this to who likes castlevainia,Recommended

bloodstained NO.9\n,Recommended
Hit an OG Alucard in the butt and got glasses. 10/10,Recommended
"This is exactly the game SOTN fans and fans of the GBA and DS Iegavanias have been waiting for. For people who love these games, you know exactly what you are in for. The shard system is basically the soul system from GBA's Aria of Sorrow and DS's Dawn of Sorrow, if you loved those games or the other Igavanias, you will love this, as it's basically the sequel fans of those games always wanted but Konami refused to greenlight.",Recommended
Iga-vania is back and better than ever. uvu,Recommended
its pretty good,Recommended
If you loved Symphony of the Night you'll love this game as well.,Recommended
"This game is a fantastic companion piece to Symphony of the Night, but it doesn't quite reach the heights of it's predecessor. Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night has garnered near universal praise and I feel it deserves every last scrap of it. If you're jonesing for a Metroidvania no other game released since Order of Ecclesia will scratch this very specific itch completely.",Recommended
"If you like ""metroidvania""  you should like this, very polished with loads of content.\nSome people have complained about a lack of direction on the main attack, but there are so many extra attacks/spells you can add to each build that it makes sense that the main attack only has so much utility.\n",Recommended
"Pretty great, about on par with Aria of Sorrow.",Recommended
"Good Game, if you liked Castlevania, you'll like this one for sure.",Recommended
it good,Recommended
"It's a good game, if you're hungry for more Castlevania action like Symphony of The Night, you gotta play this.",Recommended
"Had on-and-off followed this during development after finding it on Kickstarter. When I finally had the chance to play it, I...couldn't stop. Went from New Game to 100% completion in one go.\nGosh, didn't realize how much I had wanted to play another game in this style until now xD",Recommended
Really addicting as the old castlevanias the art style was great and also de music.,Recommended
Super great game.  Cant wait to replay to 100%,Recommended
A great game! Feels like Sotn but with better mechanics!,Recommended
"Simply Amazing. Everything you want in a Castlevania Game, except for Castlevania itself. A Recommended spiritual successor, makes you wish Konami would give this man his franchise back, just so they could have a crossover. It has it's flaws, like the rare but annoying glitches, the absurd difficulty spikes... But overall, if you are a fan of Metroidvanias, Castlevania, or even just hack and slash platformers, this is a must buy.",Recommended
Easily the best castelvania esque game since Symphony of the night,Recommended
"literally my best game of the year, so much enjoyment",Recommended
DAMN GUD SOON,Recommended
Good game,Recommended
Great game,Recommended
"If you played Soma's adventures and iked it, this game is for you.",Recommended
"I Kickstarted this game in hopes that it would live up to the amazing time I had playing ""Castlevania: Symphony of the Night"", Another game by the same lead developer ""IGA"" or Koji Igarashi. As this game is designed to be both a Spiritual successor to it. \n\nI'm happy to say that it has exceeded that in every way.\n\nTo start, Bloodstained is a 2d ""Action-Platformer"" and ""Metroidvania"" for those who don't know, that's an action platformer with a fairly open map and tons of unlockables that then in turn allow you to access more of said map. \n\nThe cons to the average person; The story is nothing fantastic, it's great, and not bad in any way, but not revolutionary if you desire as much. The game is still by a fairly small studio, and is rather new at the time of writing, and has a few hiccups, I've witnessed a Crash and a couple of Framerate drops, but seeing as how this game incentivises you to save whenever you can (both to heal and save progress) I only lost a couple of rooms. These issues will likely not be in the game for long, as the developer has already set an objective to squash them. Finally; The game is meant to be campy/cheesy it's based on a PS1 game that was loved for it's cheese. I don't think future games in the series would have the same cheese after getting it out (and a lot of fans not really feeling it) in this game.\n\nNow the FAR more important positives; The gameplay is fun, AMAZINGLY fun. You run around, kill demons, potentially get upgrades from said demons, make equipment from drops of those demons, make food back at base to raise your stats. 22 hours in and I loved every minute of it. In addition. many people have brought that up as a high-point. No point in this game makes you feel ""I want to play somthing else for a bit"" it's constantly ""Y'know what, I want to do THIS for right now."" or ""Man, fine I'll get off, but I want to get back on as soon as possible.""\n\nThis game isn't for everyone, it's meant to be an upgrade to a cheesy PS1 game, so treat it like such, and expect something a bit old-fashioned.",Recommended
from me playing 3 hours iv been playing since launch (i got it day 1 but been so busy havent had time to play it some more)\ni can safely say this game is great tho  hard as hell for someone who enjoyed some of the ds games via emualtion and loved them to death and then trying out the great game SOTN i think ill get alot more enjoyment out of this game in the coming weeks,Recommended
Honestly well worth the wait. A well done Castlevania sucessor for PC,Recommended
If you like modern metrovania games then you gonna like this.,Recommended
It's the best Castlevania game to date.,Recommended
"Miriam's cute and you play dress up like a doll. Also it just feels good to play and rewards exploration, but mostly Miriam is great. Oh yeah, David Hayter voices a character.",Recommended
"A great time.\n\nThough combat is pretty simple and there is not a ton of regular weapon variety, the shard type spells vary greatly and add a lot of spice to dealing with enemies and boss fights. Bosses often have fun mechanics that change your evasion maneuvers, and the large cast of enemies give good variety. Lots of areas to explore, with some feeling unique and others feeling a little similar to others (aside from backdrops and enemy variety). The story is interesting enough to move along the game, though somewhat predicable. Lots of secret walls and upgrades that encourage exploration, and a deep amount of equipment that give you full control over play style choices. Shortcut load-outs give good adaptability depending on encounters.\n\nBoss fights can often feel too easy depending on your equipment/ weapon choices, but certain fights will encourage you to experiment/ upgrade spells. Familiar variety is somewhat limited, but it is quite fun to see their visual changes and usefulness increase. Most voice acting is excellent, though some minor characters feel terrible in comparison. \n\nThankfully computer versions are not as buggy as the console versions. I personally experiences only a couple of freezes throughout my entire playthrough. The nature of this game encourages saving a good bit, so I never felt demoralized. \n\nIf you are a fan of Metroid and Castlevania type games, this is a must buy. \n\n",Recommended
"As someone who has never played these type of games, I've got to say that Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night was really fun. It has a nice anime style animation, cool zones, cool abilities and weapons/accessories and even cooler bosses. The game can also be a genuine challenge at times which I found really refreshing.\n\n10/10",Recommended
Good. It's what you expect from something like Aria of Sorrow or Symphony of the Night.,Recommended
"It's not Symphony of the night, but it's damn close!",Recommended
Definitely a worthy successor to games like Symphony of the Night.,Recommended
Always been a castlevania person and this definitely has the feel but i will say currently the boss fights seem quite easy so far it contains features akin to the older castlevania's such as capturing demon souls to use their powers with a unique twist it can be a bit of a grind sometimes but that's ok by me it's pretty balanced. The sounds have that symphony of the night feel at times. I feel that I have better control over the character on mouse/keyboard vs controller although this could just be me being absolutely used to keyboard as i really don't use controllers that much.,Recommended
It's the Castlevania game that Konami won't give us.,Recommended
"I'm pleasantly surprised by how good playing this game feels. It seemed like in the past, people who laid hands on it before the release didn’t have glowing things to say about it.\n\nBut it looks like they’ve pulled together into a game that plays exceptionally well. I’d just qualify that statement with that it might be weird playing this game now having not played past games that this group of people have made. If you put this game right next to modern stuff inspired by Symphony of the Night, it might feel dated in some of the way it moves or goes about gameplay stuff.\nThe music and art for the game are also excellent. I don’t have much negative to say about any aspect of it.\n\nPersonally, I haven’t had any technical issues with it either. It’s always ran smooth and I’ve not had any crashes.",Recommended
"Koji Igarashi, once again showing that he's the creator of the Castlevania side of the Metroidvania game style. This game blends parts of all previous exploration Castlevania titles. With shard collecting like Soma's souls, techniques like you would have used with Johnathon in Portrait of Ruin, and even a weapon collectathon to have at your disposal. If you like Metroidvania titles then this is a game I would highly recommend you pick up.\n\nNow we just need Castlevania: Harmony of Despair on PC and I'd be set.",Recommended
if you like castlevania then you will like this game,Recommended
"I have awaited a 2D castlevania  game that lives up to the nostalgia of playing Symphony of the Night in my early teens.  This game lives up to that and perhaps even more.  If you like SOTN then this game without a doubt hits that bar.  Absolutely love it.  I wish Konami had given Iga the ability to make a new CV, but they seem to be fine with letting their great IP turn to stone, or ruining it by running off their talented devs.  I hope Iga will continue and make more games in this vein.  This is certainly a masterpiece.",Recommended
I like this one.,Recommended
"A great game, feels like a proper follow up to post SOTN Castlevania games. Backed this game and got exactly what I wanted and more.",Recommended

"It feels like the old games, has new charms and was definitly worth the wait. Thankfully this didn't end up like 'Mighty No. 9'.",Recommended
"I  was very skeptical of whether this would have enough content to be worth the $40 price tag, I caught part of a mid-ish game stream and was amazed at how huge the castle is, and as a big fan of the GBA/DS era -Vania games I was ecstatic. \n\nPlaying the game now and it hasn't let me down at all.",Recommended
"You have no real reason to not play this game. Wonderful soundtrack, engaging gameplay, and an all around marvelous metroidvania.",Recommended
I like this game. It is fun. It has bugs. They aren't too bad. But game is good. I like this game.,Recommended
A must play for for anyone who likes the genre.,Recommended
"I can't recommend this game enough! This hits all the feels nostalgia wise, how it plays to the small improvements of replayability. Really cool concepts dealing with spells/shards, passives, and familiars. Please we all want more of this game! More characters, more DLC, more music, more shards!",Recommended
Fun game.,Recommended
reminds me of castlevania symphony of the night but you are a girl     if you enjoyed symphony of the night might enjoy this game,Recommended
Exactly what the Kickstarter promised.,Recommended
What is a game? A miserable pile of secrets.,Recommended
"I find this game as wonderful as I found the Castlevania metroidvanias. The biggest difference you could see before starting, is the price. The price is a major jump up (Or down depending on the game) compaired to how Gameboy Advance (GBA) and Nintendo Duel Screen (NDS) would have since how old the game is.",Recommended
"This game brings back soooo much nostalgia! It is like playing Castlevania: Symphony Of the Night but with a female. To make it even better is that it is made by the SAME creator of the Castlevania series! This is a must have and if you dont have this game by now, you are surely missing out. WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?!?!?!?!?!??!? GO GET THIS GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",Recommended
what can I say about this game other that it's fun as hell. For me it totally recaptured Castlevania Symphony Of The Night.The combat is really good not to hard not to easy Miriam moves as smooth as silk. Great story beautiful graphics. Secret bosses even fighting the great Iga himself. Only gripe I have with it is that it can be a bit to cryptic at times but het we got a community for that kinda stuff so nothing insurmountable. plugged ove 30 hrs into planned to more.Looking forward to the dlc as well.,Recommended
Really fun. Scratches that Castlevania: Symphony of the Night itch pretty well.\n\nReally glad this wasn't a shitshow like Mighty No. 9.,Recommended
"Have played only a bit so far, but pretty fun so far, and defo worth getting if you enjoyed the DS Castlevania games.",Recommended
A really good Castlevania Sorrows spiritual successor. The controls are tight and the enemies don't feel unfair. Totally recommended!,Recommended
"Honestly, Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night has got to be my favorite game released this year and by far my favorite indie game I've ever played.",Recommended
"I've never needed to read a walkthrough guide in any ""metroidvania"" title before. That's thanks to having accurate maps informing you of the places you have been, and the ""chests"" you still need to open. This game has an awfull map system that doesn't inform you properly of the places you still need to visit, and worst of all, it has a system where certain chests (the blue ones) ""refill"" themselves. This makes navigating the game extremely painfull when you are stuck. I was stuck trying to get the good ending, but even after spending hours I wasn't able to learn of a way to be immune to spikes (you know what I mean, every metroidvania game has it's own spikes). I had to read a walkthrough and I learned there was a chest I hadn't opened. When I watched the map I saw it was in a place marked in blue (meaning I was already there) but I had never been there before, this is because the way the map colors is not 100% precise. Also, since chest refill, I wouldn't have ever think such an important item was going to be in a damned chest.\nAfter getting the item I was left without the drive to complete the game, since I felt like I cheated (I did actually).\nWhen a game does something bad you can forgive said game and continue, but just if the fault is secondary. If a fighting game does ""fighting"" bad, or a racing game does ""racing"" bad, those game are crap. in this case, Bloodstained, a metroidvania game did navigation bad, and that is unforgivable.",Not Recommended
I kicked started it and happy I did.,Recommended
SOTN 2 wtih Aria of Sorrow's soul system.\n\nPlays and feels Castlevania. That speaks for itself.,Recommended
Didn't enjoy it as much as SotN but it was still decent.,Recommended
"Honestly? This game was worth the wait. I'll be the first to say that I'm not good at metroidvanias, because I'm way too reckless and I rush into shit. This game though? The most exciting part for me is just being able to find new shit while I'm exploring. I haven't binged a game in a long time, but this? This shit's got me going.",Recommended

If anyone played a Castlevania game from the mid 90's until the Lords of Shadow series than this is the game for you! There are some issues with pointing you where to go but those complaints have been said in the forums in a few posts.\n\nPros:\n\nLoads of weapons of different types with attacks specific to class or specific weapon\nNice large map with plenty of secrets\nMany unique enemies\nAnimations are well done and rather pretty\nMusic is just awesome and if you played any of the old Castlevania games you will recognize the style\n\nCons:\nThere are plenty little bugs here and there.\nBasic video option are missing even though it is an Unreal engine based game\nSometimes items will get stuck in walls. Easy workaround is to wait 20 seconds where items will just drop\nSmall text glitches here and there\nCertain points of story you will get lost and most likely have to look up where to go.\n\nI truly recommend this game for those that enjoy exploring a game without it holding your hand the entire time. I would give this a 8.9/10\n\n,Recommended
"Spiritual Successor to Castlevania, and it manages to hit the nail on the head perfectly. If you are looking for a new metroidvania to devote your time to, don't pass this game up. The story by itself can be done in about 10 hours, assuming you go in completely blind. I finished 100% with 28 hours logged.\n\nPros\n- Solid Metroidvania\n- Satisfying mechanics\n- Tight controls\n- The story is pretty good\n- Lots of secrets to uncover\n\nCons\n- Some of the areas of the game seem a little poorly optimized, resulting in choppy frame-rates when transitioning between scenes.\n- Some of the progression items are so absurdly hidden, you might spend hours trying to figure out what specific spot you are supposed to use your new power at in order to get an item to let you progress the game.",Recommended
"The game merges the best elements of Castlevania: Symphony of the Night and Aria of Sorrow, and refines the formula from there. Tight controls, many ways to animation cancel, support for many different playstyles with meaningful mechanical differences, and loads of fun little easter eggs to find.\n\nThe game allows stacking buffs and effects with very few restrictions, so the game can turn extremely easy towards late game or on new game+ runs if you take the time to farm upgrades, even on Nightmare NG+. This is a personal choice, however; a fresh Nightmare difficulty run is definitely challenging.",Recommended

Being a relatively large fan of the older title, I'm perfectly fine with the newly released iteration. It's the first game of its ilk in a while that fully scratches that 'Metroidvania'-esque itch for me. Plenty of games have arrived in the genre since those early days, but this one delved deeper into the elements of SotN I've missed (leveling, crafting, farming, etc).  \n\nI kickstarted the title back during the original campaign, so I've been waiting years for the release... and it's definitely paid off. \n\n",Recommended
"Worth the wait, though some bugs need to get fixed.",Recommended
"Its good, remember to save often.",Recommended
Very awesome game.,Recommended
"Basically every Metroidvania style Castlevania game after SotN rolled into one. If you loved those, then you'll love this.",Recommended
"Basically an updated sotn. Not as good, but still fun as long as you like the metroidvania style.",Recommended
The game is pretty awesome. Its my first game in this genre and im loving it,Recommended
A solid Castlevania successor. Similar to Dawn of Sorrow where the main character can gain all kinds of fun powers from defeating enemies. There were a few moments of confusion with how to get around but didn't hurt the overall experience. Would highly recommend if  you're a fan of the Castlevania series.,Recommended
Amazing game. Definitely feels like the best parts of SotN and Aria of Sorrow put together while still being its own game.,Recommended
Actually really good and not striken by the curse of the 9,Recommended
A lot of fun. Would Recommend.,Recommended
This is exactly what you'd expect it to be if you've played an Igavania before. Get it right now.,Recommended
Just a great castlevania game to be honost.,Recommended
"If you liked Symphony of the Night you'll like this.  If you haven't played Symphony yet, go play that and then come back and play this game when you feel that itch.",Recommended
Definitely worth the wait.,Recommended
"Bloodstained is the right amount of nostalgia from the original Castlevania era. The game is gorgeous and fluid, and while there were originally some performance issues, the group behind the game have pushed forth constant effort in order to update/fix the issues, as has been seen with the SWITCH port.\nTL:DR, if you like the metroidvania style you have no reason to not LOVE this game.",Recommended
"Igavania is back on the menu and Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night is a grand addition to the metroidvania genre.  This title takes the great bits and pieces from each and every non-mario style castlevania and cooks them together into an amalgamation of Iga's most finest of works.\n\nThe souls system from Dawn and Aria of sorrow? Check\nCombat techniques and same feel of combat as Symphony of the night ? Check\nDecent crafting and questing from Dawn and Order of ecclesia? Double check\n\nIf you wanted to play another game with the same sensation as any of the above titles with a small twist and all of that mixed together, then this game will quench that thirst.\n\nPros:\n-Crafting system which helps your progress throughout the game if you seem to be in a pickle.  Also completely mandatory.\n-As with the previous point, the enemy loots aren't a total grind this time around and i found myself gaining weapons and shards(spells) that almost rivaled the end game crafted weapons from random drops from enemies as I explored the castle.\n-Hard mode(which feels like the intended mode) and nightmare mode options available(not from the start or through a password inputted through the starting file name)\n-Has lots of easter eggs/secret areas that rewards exploration and experimentation.  I felt like I was sequence breaking half the time because of techniques and small ways around areas before you gained the actual intended ability to navigate them.\n-2.5d if thats your taste(could also be a con if the models and graphics are not to your taste.\n-Music most of the time fits the setting or area. Sadly isn't as memorable as from the other Igavania titles but is still enjoyable.\n-Additional modes: speedrun mode, boss rush mode etc...\n-DLC coming which includes more playable characters and more to come.\n\nCons:\n-Weapon types are still generic and the one problem in the metroidvania, castlevania titles are sort of present in the game.\nwith almost 6 out of the 10 weapon types feel are wasted potential with an almost same feel/animation with spear,dagger,rapier,kicks,clubs and short swords all having similar animations but just adding or reducing attack range and slightly increasing attack speed or reducing it.  While greatswords,whips,katanas,and guns are different in its own right while almost feeling different then the previous mentioned weapon types.  This game stuck some of the outdated choices from its inspiration.\n-Slightly stiff combat.  If you buy this game knowing its background and history then this game will feel right at home to you, \nbut if you've never even heard of a metroidvania or Igavania then I can see this title feeling clunky and stiff, at least in terms of combat.  With the guns unable to shoot at least diagonally, the spears unable to be thrusted up and down, and having no knowledge about landing attack canceling or backstep attack canceling, I've heard and read some peoples slight frustrations with the combat.  All of this is as intended because this game was Iga's love letter to its previous fans but i still feel some slight alterations would have been for the better.\n-Story: Its ok, very generic (can be a pro).  I never found anything wrong with it as I loved everything else about the game so I have a bias.  Also I could almost tell exactly what was going to happen.\n-Difficulty: being locked behind finishing the game or hidden passwords.  100% normal with every achievement, beat hard, played nightmare.  Did not know about the passwords till after(this game was crazy fun finding everything on my own) but usually start every game I play on hard or at least the 2nd hardest mode.  It felt like the game was too easy on normal and felt like how it was intended for hard, with nightmare being the challenge mode.\n-Wished it has a lot more content(I want more!) 25hrs play time on normal got me every shard, weapon, and collectible. 25hrs play time or even more isn't bad for fully 100% a game but if I didn't i could see the play time being much shorter.  Also (spoilers) there being multiple bad endings some people would be inclined to just leave it at that a bad ending and be done with it.\n\nAll in all Iga's love letter to the castlevania fans that wanted more Symphony of the Night, dawn,aria,CoTm, OoE was delivered.  It survived the skepticism from being a kickstarter and braved through the coming controversies during development, I think Igavanias are to stay and that we may be having more of it to come!",Recommended
A great experience. This game delivers where other contemporary kickstarted games have failed.,Recommended
Did you like Castlevania SotN on PS1? Then you will like this game.\n\nThis game is everything I wnated it to be personally. Cannot wait for future playable characters :D,Recommended
"The gameplay is classic modern Castlevania but everything around that solid core feels a bit janky. It's quite an ugly looking game and certain areas look unfinished, although it is not as bad as it used to be... they almost got close to it looking decent. The actual game is a little buggy and lacking polish, just small things like items getting stuck in the ground (you automatically collect them but it still looks bad), and I crashed to desktop once and also got stuck floating in water which happens if you slide in. A lot of the enemies are just reskinned versions of the same creature with the same sounds and I also recognised some room layouts that were reused. The weakest area so far are the boss fights which feel particularly bad, like they don’t move around properly, especially when Castlevania bosses were usually very tightly designed. It feels like I’m fighting normal enemies with boss health bars, but they have such weak attack patterns that all you have to do is stand still and hold down the spell button to kill them.\n\nAll the weapons and spells are varied and fun to collect but I would 100% recommend starting on hard (there’s a code you can use) if you have any decent skill in games like this as most of the shards are very badly balanced and make the game too easy. I had to force myself to use bad spells and still did not die once on normal until I got to a late game boss.\n\nOverall it's still worth playing, it's not a bad game but certainly not the best in the genre. You can tell they struggled a bit with this first game but I think Bloodstained 2 could be really good with the foundations they have set.",Recommended
its good,Recommended
"checks all the boxes you expect, pretty solid.",Recommended

"I backed this game on Kickstarter many years ago, and I am pleased to say that it was the best investment I've ever made. The game is amazingly well done and lots of fun to play. There's tons of content already and plenty more free DLC on the way. If you enjoy metroidvanias then this game is a must have, if you've never played a metroidvania before then this game is a great entry title to the genre. Just as a pre-warning, this game does not hold your hand and guide you as to what you need to do next, there are many times where what you need to do is so obscure it'll take you forever to figure it out unless you stumble across it by accident. Despite that it's still very rewarding to play and I can't recommend this game enough. At the very least, give it a try and if you don't like it you can always refund it.",Recommended
"It's worth full price. Great variety of moves and weapons, rewarding exploration, and fun boss fights. The graphics are beautiful.",Recommended

"I was one of the backers for this game what feels like forever ago, and I can finally say it's been worth the wait! This game looks great, controls great, sounds great, and it's got everything I look for in a MetroidVania! There are so many weapons and shards to collect that there's no shortage of ways to eviscerate enemies (the game makes great use of a rumble controller as well, you definitely FEEL the impact when you deal a powerful hit). You could replay the game dozens of times with a different weapon type or shard of choice each time and it still wouldn't get old! Also, if the in-game bestiary is anything to go by, I managed to sequence break multiple times just from playing around with all the movement tools available. This is the kind of fun I play MetroidVanias for! Before you even reach the end you find yourself thinking about what route you're going to take on your next playthrough, and by the time you do arrive at the finale you feel you've attained godhood. That's to say nothing of all the easter eggs this castle's got tucked away in its walls!\n\nTo bring this ramble to a close, Bloodstained delivers the Recommended MetroidVania experience! Even after 100%ing it, I definitely see myself going back to it!",Recommended
"I wouldn't rank this as high as SotN, Harmony of Dissonance, or Aria of Sorrow but it’s still a great, if unofficial, entry in the long-running Metroidvania style of Castlevania games. \n\nKind of buggy, though! Be sure to save a lot or just be ready for some frustration because the game has a knack for crashing right as you’re getting close to exploring a big new area but haven’t yet found the save room. Also ran into quite a few less harmful animation bugs and such, but it’s the crashing that is the main problem. \n\nAesthetically, it's a mixed bag. Bloodstained has a pretty kitschy look that I initially didn’t care for, but it ended up being a much quirkier game than I expected and it grew on me over time. Music is okay, but it’s the one element that I thought was far behind the prior entries in the series. \n\nOverall I’m pretty happy with the game, which is nice because on average happiness is something I only experience maybe once or twice per year. Thanks, Iga!",Recommended
"Pretty Fun, basically the same game as SotN with newer graphics.",Recommended
not bad,Recommended
Fun & addicting. Havent been able to stop playing since i got it,Recommended
I've been irritated at the castlevania games since dawn of sorrow. The art style and the feel of the games was just off. ENTER BLOODSTAINED. I love this game. It has every goddamned thing I like from all the castlevania games and new stuff too that I also like. My only real complaint is that the DLC doesn't really add anything that's worth the extra money but I want to support the publisher so YOLO,Recommended
This game is great! Reminds me of why I loved Castlevania SOTN so much.,Recommended
Excellent Igavania. This was worth the delay. If you are a fan of Castlevania: Symphony of the Night this game is a must buy.,Recommended
+ great music\n+ combat feels smooth and snappy\n+ excellent verity in weapons and abilities\n\n- map does not auto focus on where you are on it and is not very detailed\n- normal is a little too easy\n\nif you loved igarashi's games before then this is on par with the rest of them,Recommended

In my opinion it's a Recommended successor to the Castlevania series!,Recommended
"I enjoyed this game and it's really playable with a potato laptop (my laptop is too old). The music is enchanting and there's like a huge arsenal of weapons, shards and equipment that completely alters how the game is played each time obtaining a new ability.

Character customization - Customize Miriam the way you like it\n3. Music is enchanting\n4. Boss fight are challenging\n\n50/50:\n1. May be repetitive as backtracking is required frequently but still understandable as new skills were unlocked\n",Recommended
Bloodstained is pretty much everything one would want from a Castlevania title without the baggage of being attached to Konami. The controls are pretty tight and everything feels classic and fresh at the same time.,Recommended
yeah,Recommended
"Genuinely excellent. The kind of game you play through twice, but still dread the moment when it's done.",Recommended
"Extremely good and worth every penny if you like the genre. My only nitpicks are (in order of relevance):\n1- The controls can feel a little limiting. The evade is not too useful, I wish it was replaced with some sort of dash-attack. Furthermore, it would be cool to be able to attack in any direction.\n2- lack of English subtitles (handy if you would like to play with Japanese audio).\n3- Miriam's outfit (for the most part) doesn't change regardless of the equipped items.",Recommended
I love this type of games you will get feel of accomplishment when you get everything 100%.,Recommended
Way better than I thought it was going to be.\nIt has some questionable animations and the art style leaves some to be desired but the game-play is top notch!,Recommended
"A Recommended to form Iga-era exploration and combat side-scroller with modern twists. secret rooms, hidden endings, monsters hiding on trains, and innovative boss fights all elevate the game well past its spiritual predecessors. Exploring a castle full of demons has never been more fun.",Recommended

It kept getting delayed and every time they showed the game I got a little more afraid of the way it would turn out.\n\nCastlevania Syphony of the Night is one of my favorite games of all time and this one is right up there for me. Only time will tell if it stays in my thoughts as much as SotN has after 20+ years, but this game definitely has a lot of quality of life improvements over SotN.\n\nI'd HIGHLY recommend this game if you are looking for the next great SotN.",Recommended

"8/10.\n\nI thought Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night was very fun, not to mention great value at 40 dollars. The game provided me with many hours of entertainment, probably more than I would get out most 60-dollar triple-A games, in fact. \n\nI did my first playthrough of the game on Nightmare mode, as I wanted to see what the game could offer in terms of difficulty. I'm sure some of my grievances aren't applicable to the other difficulties. Mostly, Bloodstained felt good to play. Exploring was exciting from start to finish, which surprised me, as I would usually get bored about halfway through. Every rare item and ability acquired felt like much-needed upgrades, especially early in the game. This made grinding and looking for secrets fun. However, I had a few issues with Bloodstained that subtracted from the experience a bit. These are the main focus of this review.\n\nOn Nightmare, your character starts off as an absolute noodle that can not go toe to toe with the vast majority of the monsters, so you quickly realize that magic is the hands down best way of dealing damage while staying reasonably safe. You start spamming your most cost-effective spell and  - if you're a brave boi - weave in an attack or two to conserve mana. You then move on to the next room, but OwO what's this? *notices you have literally 2 mana* \nBecause of the aforementioned noodle situation, you end up having to wait at the entrance of a room - sometimes for minutes - while you regenerate your mana to a point where you can actually take on the next room before you get rushed down by a monster that kills you in a couple of hits.\n\nThis issue is almost non-existent in the later stages of the game, but for like half the game you regenerate 1 mana per second (while being entirely dependent on magic that costs at least 15 mana,) until you find a chest containing recipes for drinks that - all of a sudden - like... octuples your mana regeneration..? I would have liked to see these drinks spread throughout the game, or perhaps a boost in mana regeneration speed while the character is idling. It would have spared me a lot of time spent doing absolutely nothing. I used the first spell you get in the game for, once again, like half the game. I had over twenty stronger, cooler alternatives, but I couldn't afford to cast any of them. It doesn't help that in the patch I played, items like 'Witch's Hat', a hat that is supposed to boost magic recovery, simply doesn't.\n\nThe movement can feel sluggish. (Once again, this isn't as much of an issue later on, as you get movement abilities and, in general, more ways to recover from bad situations.) It was certainly the source of a good deal of frustration for me at several points during the game. Platforming was no issue, but in tense situations like boss fights, I found myself having to slow down and be more careful about my inputs, as my character would legit just freak out if I went too fast, and end up backstepping into the enemy or shooting an ability the wrong way. I tested the joysticks of both an Xbox One controller and a PS4 controller - both relatively new - and it did seem like my character would randomly face the other direction if I moved the joystick too fast, or, while in the air, jump kick diagonally when I wanted to jump kick straight down, and vice versa. I don't mind most of the movement sluggishness, as this is clearly an old-school type of game, but something about the way my character moved sometimes definitely felt fishy to me.\n\nIn terms of power of the player character, the progression was a bit ridiculous. Very slow, linear increase in power as you find weapons that do a few more points of damage and armor that negates a few more points of damage, with gigantic spikes in the mid-game and the end. I ended up beating the final couple of bosses on my first try, which kind of shocked me, seeing as how I had been getting my ass handed to me by the bosses for the vast majority of the game. (One encounter with a certain swordsman took me well over 50 tries, I'm sure.) While it felt good to be the one dealing out the asskicking instead of being on the receiving end for once, it made the final bosses feel a bit trivial and anticlimactic, and they weren't nearly as enjoyable as the boss fights in the early to mid-game.\n\nThese issues aren't that big of a deal, but they do prevent the game from being a 10/10 for me, personally. It was still great fun, though, and has renewed my interest in Metroidvania.",Recommended
"They absolutely nailed this game. As a huge SotN fan i'm pleased to say that this game surpasses it by quite a margin. They have improved a lot from SotN, and I will tell you how much better this game is:\n\n-SotN had RPG elements that felt unecessary, bareboned and useless. In this game they improved the RPG elements quite a bit. It feels as a natural part of the game, and something you need to use and implement in your gameplay to progress against the harder bosses and demons. \n-In SotN second half of the game we were introduced to a inverted castle. RotN improves this mechanic hugely by giving the player the inverted ability so that the player can invert the castle with a click of a button. In SotN you could not do this, and had to backtrack to a spot to change form normal to inverted or vice versa. This mechanic that RotN introduces improves the gameplay and make the game flow so much better.\n-The bosses in this game are much more varied and harder than in SotN of the night. You could argue that SotN had cooler designed bosses, but in this game most of the bosses actually put up a fight and has interesting abilites and patterns. \n-The game is at least 3x bigger and has more depth than SotN. \n-This game offers a lot of value for money and tons of replayability. If you want to get all of the achievements, explore everything, get 100% on everything you could easily get 30-40 hours out of this game on your first run. And after that you have New Game +, harder difficulties, boss rush mode and speedrun mode. Also DLC is going to come with new content and I heard new playable characters.\n-The game is visually fantastic with beatiful designed enviroments, enemies and the player animation is so well done. The abilities and weapons have fantastic animations which makes you want to try out new thing and explore different playstyles because everything flows so well.\n-The soundtrack is well made, but of course can't match SotN masterpiece. I want a SotN soundtrack mod on this game! That would be orgasmic. \n-The cheesy dialogue and characters from SotN is all here in its full cheesiness. \n\nWhat is there not to love about this game? I only wish it was more polished and maybe they should have ditched the outdated save system. But this is only a little minor annoyance in a fantastic game overall.\n",Recommended
This game is unbelievable. A revival of symphony of the night.,Recommended
"let me get it straight, wonderful game, with a lot to discover.\nSince ""Castlevania: Aria of Sorrow"" I played every single Iga game and im not disappointed with this game.I bought that game for good old times sake, and even though  I'm disabled, doesn't mean those games are impossible to play with that.\nthe secrets are fun, like the 8 bit-area (even though that Boss is over-powered), the ambient is straight on with the ochestral music (guess it's the same Music producer from Castlevania: Symphonie of the Night).\nit's challenging, but not unplayable challenging. The enemy design is unique and NOT just an re-texture from other Igavania.\n\nbut now aa few little adjustments:\n\n- some Loot stucks in the air since Day 1 (Enemy drops to be more precisessive)\n\n- some information are a little bit cryptic like the ""Aegis-Amor"" for proceeding in the story.\n\n- the Iron Maidens were an absolut disaster for me to figure out, that you can move them with Craftwork.\n\n-the Iga extention pack is too overpriced for one op bossfight (4,99E would have been an good price, not 9,99€)\n\nnow the pro's :\n\n+ stick with the enemys in an sequel/prequel, they are challenging, fitting with the 17xx theme and having an nice dificulty curve. (maybe those with like 50+ newer enemys)\n\n+ the soundtrack is godly, keep up the nice work.\n\n+ every enemy has an own litte unique background with real life / entertaining background / lore ( like the Monster compendium in ""Castlevania: Order of Eccelsia"") would add a few enemys from the greek and Nordic Mythology like Nidhogrr in ur next game)\n\n+ the gameplay is responsible, quick and has no pits (please no pits in the next title, i beg you xD)\n\n+ the shart system were like the soul system in Castlevania: Dawn of Sorrow, it adds a lot replay value...thats always nice.\n\n+ IGA is BACK.\n \n\n\nthanks for reading this review, I hope a few will read that and please don't correct my grammer, after all I'm not an native speaker and i usally don't write reviews.",Recommended

"Its look, still kinda ganky with loot drops and map glitches. Also them hitboxes are dumb.",Recommended
Pretty Fun,Recommended
"Castlevania is finally back, in all but name. This game takes just about every mechanic from Symphony of the Night, the Sorrow games, and Order of Ecclesia and packs it all together in one beautiful and giant castle. This is nothing like the disaster of Mighty No. 9, or the mediocre Yooka-Laylee, IGA set out to make his own Castlevania and he succeeded like no one else. I am so happy I backed this project for as much as I did.",Recommended
"Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night is a must play for any fan of metroidvanias or just good games in general.\n\n+ Smooth and responsive gameplay with some pretty interestingly designed enemies and boss encounters.\n+ The RPG elements are well integrated and provide a huge amount of customization options.\n+ Superb graphics. Bloodstained is one of the best examples of 2.5D graphics done right. The lighting especially is extremely well crafted and greatly enhances the mood of each and every zone.\n+ Amazing soundtrack.\n+ Great replayability with even more modes coming soon.\n\n- The story is a bit lackluster. It exists just to be there, but it barely matters. The occasional 3D cutscenes also feel low-budget and stand out next to the extremely polished gameplay. What saves this a little is the fact that Miriam is a very likable character.\n- At the moment of this review the game was a bit buggy with problems like items getting stuck in the walls, minor camera glitches in some of the areas and very rare crashes (happened to me once during a 20-hour playthrough). Nothing gamebreaking, but overall it creates the impression of a lack of technical polish.",Recommended
"IGA successfully recpatures that Symphny of the Night formula, while balancing it out with everything he learned along the way.\n\nProper Metroidvaina's are about overkill in the amount of options presented to you, just as much as they are about blue maps, back tracking, and exploration. If you've missed having these kind of player options in most clone games, then Bloodstained is the game for you. \n\nHe knocked it out of the park in my book.",Recommended
"Fantastic game, if you have ever played and enjoyed an Igavania before I am sure you will love this.",Recommended
"Really solid metroivania from the man himself! Only issue I've had so far is how rough the game starts off if you choose to start on hard mode (did because I heard normal was too easy), but its great otherwise.",Recommended
One of the best metroidvania in recent memory.  Well worth the price of admission if that is your thing.,Recommended
"I was a kickstarter backer and if this game had let me down in any way, I would definitely be talking about it. Sure this game has a few minor issues on Steam but they're fixable bugs that don't stop you from enjoying what is an amazing and well constructed concept based on Castlevania Symphony of the Night. Iga and his team did the unexpected for a kickstarter project and created something everyone loves. \n\nI've played through it twice and I'm currently going through nightmare mode. Many many hours have been spent 100% this game and they were all worth it. When you start out it seems quite easy. The first boss is typical, but from there on it ramps up the difficulty with each boss and section to become quite a challenge. After you beat it you can new+ to hard mode which lowers your skill levels a bit and increases the enemy population. After that nightmare ramps it up like crazy. Replayability is definitely there.\n\nSimilar to many recent vania games you have a selection of weapons, equipment, items, and powers that can change up your play style along with experience leveling. Shards are this game's special power items which give you a wide range of abilities. There are shards that improve your weapons and shards that create passive abilities at level 9. There are a lot of items that enhance grinding for gold, items, or shards but some you won't get until far into the game. There will be a decent amount of backtracking but there are plenty of warp points and save spots are usually in the perfect spot just before a challenging point.\n\nGrinding isn't necessarily needed to beat the game, but it's recommended. A few certain shards are definitely worth grinding to top level. Also pro tip, at the beginning the game makes a big deal out of telling you collecting shards will corrupt you but there is no actual penalty for collecting tons of shards... so go nuts. There is also a crafting element to the game you will have to grind for but once you craft something you can purchase it in the shop. Also instead of grinding you can break down equipment that have the items you need. It's much easier since some items you need drop at 1-4% rate.\n\nAt this time there are a few bugs. One of the most obnoxious is item drops getting stuck in walls and not being able to pick them up. There are also a few clever ways to get to the end of the game far earlier than you should be able to, which is great for speedrunners but not so great if you want to 100% the game and got lost. I seriously thought the boss was just super difficult, turned out I was way further in than I was supposed to be thanks to a jump kick exploit. This game could definitely use a player guide.\n\nOverall this game is awesome. It's a solid 8 or 9 for me. I recommend playing with a D-Pad if you can, it's easier to control. I think this could be a 10 depending on how the rest of the content plays out once they release it. At this time there are still more modes and characters to be released. Some people just don't like the art style and judge the whole game on that, which is kinda ridiculous because the game is fantastic.",Recommended
easily one of my favorite new metroidvania games,Recommended
If you loved Symphony of the Night from game play and the RPG mechanics that complimented it this is the modern spiritual successor you were looking for. The story wont knock your socks off but if you are looking for a great metriodvania that requires 100% completion and tons of combat options to choose from this will not disappoint.,Recommended
"Its like the castlevania game I never got to play~ Great choice of weapons, crafting, shop, lil cool details, quests, its got everything!",Recommended
"good game, good bosses",Recommended
"An ode to classic Castlevania games, with the highs and lows that follow. Only one major terrible design decision (a content-gating movement ability dropping from a common, non-boss enemy, and at less than 100% drop rate!), and a lot of great design and sound work.",Recommended

A trip down memory lane for fans of Castlevania: Symphony of the Night and Castlevania: Aria of Sorrow; a must buy for metroidvania enthusiasts; and for you completionists out there.... have fun grinding flying beef for an hour. 10/10,Recommended
Great Game,Recommended
Remembering me 6 years old playing Castlevania Symphony Of The Night. I have 10k hours in it. I love it so much.,Recommended
"While admittedly probably a little TOO close to being similar other ""Igavanias"", I do greatly appreciate some of the improvements: such as encouraging the player to enhance your passive shards to make them into skill shards giving them actual purpose, map markers(THANK YOU), and slightly more generous drop rates(Or atleast, it feels like it), on top of giving players options to buy previously made items and breaking them down for materials so the player can just focus on farming money rather than farming a particular enemy. There is definitely grind still, but it honestly does not feel that bad compared to older Igavanias. Kinda wish the material for dismantling was either cheaper or you didn't need as much for the bigger items.\n\nI noticed some complaining about balance of weapons, but I feel there is still a good variety and options for what suits the player's desires while not gimping them out completely. Sure, perhaps daggers will not do AS much damage as great swords, but you still got a fair bit of options to make daggers just as attractive to use. Techniques may also not be as strong or easy as skills, but again, I do enjoy the options. \n\nThis is bloodstain's strength: The options in combat. You can even turn off some of the previously maxed out skill shards if you feel you are too strong. \n\nThat being said: Not a fan of the hitboxes of some enemies and bosses attacks, some of the techniques are bit harder to pull off if they share similar motions, I am also not a fan of the game not mentioning where you can find items that can only be found in respawnable chests such as garlic, pepper and soy sauce. I have also noticed some frame drops and even occasional freeze at times. Now the freezing isn't too gamebreaking at times, but it is WILDLY inconsistent. There were  moments of there being one enemy and hardly any projectiles and the game freezes for a bit before going back to normal. Also, while I do love the visuals, there were rare times where it felt there were too much going on and I have no idea what actually hit me, since projectiles and enemies blend in. \n\nBut in all honestly, I feel this is a very good foundation and the game itself is worth it in it's current state. I would definitely recommend it, especially if you are a fan of Castlevania: Aria/Dawn of Sorrow.\n\n\n\n\n",Recommended
"Really happy to say that the first Kickstarter game that I ever backed is a success story. Great game, and a worthy successor to Castlevania.",Recommended
"Unlike the passable Yooka Laylee or the awful Mighty No. 9, Koji Igarashi has delivered on what he promised and then some with the masterpiece that is Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night.\n\nThis game looks gorgeous, has a fantastic soundtrack, and plays great. The quality and amount of content make it a must-buy for Metroidvania fans.",Recommended
"Absolutely amazing, if you like old castlevania games like Symphony of the night, you gonna love this.",Recommended
Basically SoTN. Play this game.,Recommended
"When I first started playing this game, I instantly got the feeling that I'm playing a proper Castlevania game. The combat mechanics were almost identical to those found In Castlevania: Symphony of the Night, Aria of Sorrow and alike titles, with it's pros and cons.\nFor me the only negative thing was how the movement felt very slow especially when you had to backtrack accross the map.\n\nPersonally loved the first playthrough, and most likely I'll be starting another one on harder difficulty soon.",Recommended
"Four years after an incredibly successful crowdfunding campaign, Koji Igarashi's spiritual successor to the Castlevania series was released on PC and consoles. I didn't originally fund it, as the game looked pretty rough back in 2015, and the campaign updates I caught here and there throughout the years didn't always inspire confidence. Delays, new studios brought on to help on the project, cancelled ports, awful presentation, Ritual of the Night was shaping up to be a classic crowdfunding disaster. \n\nBut then, the sidegame Bloodstained: Curse of the moon was released, and after giving it a shot, I got hooked. It played beautifully even for a game designed with older trends in mind, and made me interested in checking out Ritual of the Night. I got my hands on one of the more recent builds, and played through the tutorial level before turning it off with a smile on my face and a promise to myself to pick up the completed game on release if it reviewed well. In the meantime, I kept an eye on campaign updates and saw with glee that the developers had heard the criticism directed at the visuals, promising to improve them.\n\nSo here we are. Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night was officially released on Steam on June 18th 2019, and I got myself a copy since reviews were overwhelmingly positive, with everyone going on about the quality of the game. Ritual of the Night is a 2D Metroidvania, in this case referred to as an Igavania, in which you control Miriam, a character known as a Shardbinder, someone with the ability to absorb magical shards sometimes dropped by enemies, which allows her to use their powers. You just destroyed an enemy who was spitting fireballs at you and got their shard ? By equipping it, you can now shoot fireballs yourself. Powers are extremely varied, with magical shields, familiars, creature summons, slowing powers, tracking arrows, radioactive lasers and much more. Shards can also be improved through alchemy, enhancing their effects and making them all the more deadly. With over a hundred different powers in the game and many of them viable, Bloodstained ensures a lot of potential experimentation and replayability.\n\nWith those powers at hand, you're charged with stopping Gebel, only other known Shardbinder and current ruler of the dark castle that makes up most of the game's map. In Recommended Metroidvania fashion, you explore a maze of hallways filled with puzzles, enemies and platforming challenges, and punctuated by the occasional boss fight, most of which are excellent. Enemies often drop new pieces of equipment and shards, and speaking of equipment, boy is there a lot of it. There is an insane number of weapons of all types, many of which are only available through crafting if you're looking to get the best ones (and they're totally worth it), and you can equip other pieces such as scarves, rings, helmets and body armor, many of which change Miriam's physical appearance. Said appearance can be further modified by a certain NPC which can change your hairstyle, hair color, eye color, skin color (you can even be blue or green, now that's diversity !), and the color of your dress. It's nothing incredible these days but changing your character's appearance is always a lovely feature.\n\nEvery now and then, you'll find a stained glass room which acts as a teleporter, allowing you to warp around the map and back to the hub. Said hub contains the shop, NPCs that give out quests for items or enemy contracts, and the alchemist which is the main source of new weapons and armor. It's highly recommended to make use of his services, as improving your weapons and armor goes a long way in making the late game areas easier to navigate. Miriam gains experience as she takes down foes and can level up, increasing her health, magic and other stats. You can also find tons of health, magic and gun ammo upgrades as you explore and break down suspicious walls (which sadly contain no chicken), allowing you to develop your character even further. \n\nThe game's soundtrack is pretty enjoyable and I can't stop listening to it on Youtube. Enemy designs are weird, creative and I love them. Graphics look weird in screenshots but in action the game looks fantastic. Voice acting is mostly top notch with a couple of big names like David Hayter, but some lines are spoken too softly and get lost in the music, and the game's presentation as a whole could use an extra coat of paint, with mediocre animations, a map which has a lot of readability issues, typos in dialogue, some dated effects and a HUD that's gorgeous on one side and ugly as butts on the other. But those are but small issues in the face of what is undeniably one of 2019's best games so far and a great entry into the Metroidvania genre, which will be remembered for years to come. \n\nSo in conclusion, Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night is an amazing game which, despite a couple of hiccups, succeeds in bringing back the spirit of the series whose ashes it was born from, while also throwing in its own ideas and crafting its own identity along the way. With great gameplay variety, a huge map to explore, great bosses to challenge and a killer soundtrack, this game should absolutely end up in your library.",Recommended

This game is everything i loved and missed about the Igavania games.\nIt's like Symphony of the Night and Aria/Dawn of Sorrow had a baby.\n\n10/10,Recommended
"If you enjoyed castlevania symphony of the night you'll also love this same thing different story and I mean SAME thing only negative I can see about this same abilities, same weapons to an extent, same Idea, slightly shorter  but for lovers of the metroidvania style this game is a must played for a week straight.",Recommended
"I've only played 1 or 2 Metroidvania-esque games on steam, and none outside of that. This is by far tied with Hollow Knight for a good exploration and one of the better games made out there.\n\nYou will see people complain about it's Anime-esque nature, the fact that it crash's or the fact that it can be a little buggy, but you very rarely see people complain about the games mechanics or core concepts.\n\nHonestly, I don't understand why people are complaining about the Anime-Esque nature of the game sometimes, as this game was literally based off of the Castlevania series, which is the closest you're going to get to Anime Vampire nonsense. \n\nPlay the game, have fun with it, and if you don't like it, that's fine too. You still gave your money to play it.",Recommended
Awesome game from Iga again. This will be replayed again and again like SotN. 11/10,Recommended
Bloodstained has set a new baseline for what a 'vania style game should be. It's absolutely phenomenal.,Recommended
"Bloodstained: Ritual of The Night is a love letter to past ""Igavania"" games, warts and all. Those familiar with the Iga's past games will feel like they are putting on a comfortable pair of old shoes. Nearly everything in this game is both parts frustrating and rewarding. Although there are tons of demon shards and weapons at Miriam's disposal, I feel there is little incentive to switch loadouts once you find one that works for you other than for the sake of experimentation or necessity. The graphics, environments, and voice acting are all more than serviceable, albeit uneven. You get a good amount of content to play with for the price of admission. The game is long enough, especially with new game plus, that the price point doesn't feel like a rip-off, and it is short enough that it is one of the games in my library I played to the end. Definitely recommended if one likes side scrollers, especially the games in Castlevania's back catalog.",Recommended
A classic Metriodvania by one of the founders of the genre.  Significant variety in abilities and weapons means you're sure to find a play style you enjoy.,Recommended

"You have no idea how happy I am that this turned out fine.\n\nPros:\n+ Classic Igavania gameplay\n+ Pretty cool bosses\n+ A surprisingly cool cast and a decent story\n+ A large variety of shards and weapons\n+ Addicting collectibles and quests\n+ Great sense of progression that some metroidvanias lack\n+ Good level design and sense of exploration\n+ Not overly long like most metroidvanias where I just lose interest, this is a very very big one for me.\n\nCons:\n- The soundtrack is okay but not on par with the other Castlevania games\n- Screen tearing. Lots of it.\n- Some shards and weapons do not feel as satisfying as the rest, the whips and the greatswords just felt weak compared to the faster weapons\n- Bugs. There were many times I was not able to pick up item drops and that sorta made me mad. \n- [spoiler]The red moon stuff that i could never figure out myself without a look online. Sure, that is some of the charm in these games, but I really wanted to approach this on my own. [/spoiler]\n\nOverall, I loved my time with the game. Even though there are some flaws and shortcomings, I am really looking forward to seeing where the series go next.",Recommended
Great game,Recommended
"An ""Igavania"" that really does capture the feel of his Castlevanias of old-ish(?) People often look towards Symphony of the Night for comparison, but I'd honestly say it's more in line with Aria of Sorrow, which is a good thing in my opinion. Otherwise it plays well, sounds wonderful, and looks nice. Only issue I've had with it is that my PS4 controller will randomly decide to disconnect and reconnect only while playing Bloodstained. Not a huge problem, but strange all the same.",Recommended

Im a huge Castlevania SOTN fan and to finally play this game is FANTASTIC!

"This is a great time, if you played Castlevainia:SotN then you'll probally enjoy this. The only downsides i can think of are sometimes loot will fall in areas you cant get(ex: in the ceiling/floor for flying enimies) also Recommended to the original, it doesn't have any auto save, and you need to go to a save point.\n\neverything else is great, the art, the music(i usually play games with music off, but it so fitting here that i leave it on) the gameplay(bit dated, but good, and what i wanted)\n\nreally hope this becomes a series\n",Recommended
Great game that has a SOTN vibe. The game is a bit short and easily can run through it in less than 10 hours if you are not worry about doing achievements. Even though it's short I see myself playing this for quite sometime running through with different gears and builds. Hoping they add more content!!!,Recommended

"The controls seemed a little clunky at first, but this game definitely scratched the itch for SOTN",Recommended
"Since I put in money into the Bloodstained campaign 2015 there has been a steady stream of high quality metroidvania games coming out, many of which I haven't even had time to try. From testing the early versions I had mild expectations for RotN, but I can happily say that the end product way surpassed that. Most importantly, the controls are tight, sound and music great, and the exploration is mostly fun and rewarding. It certainly has the feel of those great Igavanias on say the GB and Nintendo DS. \nThree times I was quite annoyingly, and unnecessarily, stuck for hours though. It would have been preferred if certain npc re-told whatever clues that were said only once. Due to this I was way overpowered by the time I finally located the third boss, and onward for the rest of the game. Similarly, I am always annoyed by difficulty level being locked down (and in RotN also not at all detailed!) at start. By the time I remembered backers were sent a code to fill in as name to unlock them I had already advanced too far into the game to be bothered. Another personal negative is that I at the time of writing had not received my physical PC-version that I had looked forward to, but it does of course not lower my impression of the game itself.\nOverall , it is not as great as Hollow Knight, one of my favourite games of all time, but I think I will go back and attempt to replay RotN on Hard difficulty and unlock all the things I left in my first 30 hour Normal-run. It is very rare now a days that I feel that I want to replay a game so that if anything should speak for the high quality. Hopefully Iga is not ready to retire from the genre yet.",Recommended
"Disclaimer: I bought this game on steam, I did not contribute with funding on Kickstarter (KS). \n\nWhat a game. With how risk and wild KS landscape is I had no expectation at all when I pick up the game. I did want it to succeed of course. And no regrets here. It delivers and beyond. \n\nAt the moment of writing this review I am very close to 100% it, just missing 1 main achievement to get them all. The game had me hooked since the day I started to play it and everything feels great. The atmosphere, the fluid movements, the music, the stages are so nicely design. Story isn't anything mind blowing but it does the job to keep the game going. \n\nI had no encounter with game breaking bug(s). One bug that followed me around and I wouldn't mind seeing it getting fix it sometimes when an enemy drops a loot bag in a weird spot it might take a few seconds for the character to pick it up. When loot\nwas important it kinda slowed up the momentum when doing focused farming on specific mobs. One small let down for me was the whip wpn, I wish the whip mechanic felt better, the animation is fine just even with jump cancel attack it still felt off/input delay somehow. Really weird to explain but it just feels like they could have done a better job with the whips in this game, especially since well IGA is involve with this :^)) \n\nThis for me is one of the rare good KS stories with a good ending. I definitely would recommend this game, especially if you come from the Castlevania games and is a big fan of them and is still sitting on the fence for this one.",Recommended

Castlevania Aria of Sorrow 2.0 with 3D waifus,Recommended
"Before Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night came out, there were many possible woes for me: Will it be a rush job? Did too many cooks spoil the meal? Did Iga's style age as well as I thought it would? After all, there have been many Metroidvanias since Order of Ecclesia 11 years ago. The genre has certainly not been dormant in the indie / mid-shelf scene and benchmarks may have shifted.\nIn the end, Bloodstained fulfilled the high expectations, arguably even exceeded them. Combat is satisfying, exploration truly an adventure full of surprises and the RPG-elements work perfectly. I'm surprised how much I love the crafting system. If you do want to cook every recipe though, brace yourself for farming certain enemies for a good while. Many minutes, but thankfully not hours.\nThe great aspects massively outweigh the not so great ones here, but if I had to choose the biggest negative, it's that there are instances where finding the next area or the tool to progress is obscure even by Iga's standards. If you're genuinely stuck, drop your pride and look up what you might be missing. There's no point in wandering without a plan.\nIn its default setting, the game's combat and boss difficulty is indeed pretty low, a fairly gentle cruise. Hard mode unlocks after you beat the game with the best ending or if you input the name ""Nightmare"". If you did not feel challenged before, definitely try that one out. It's a different league and you'll have so much more fun with it.\nAll in all, Bloodstained is a Kickstarter success story in a time when these are greatly needed and feel so few and far between. A lot of content is still promised for the future but as it stands, we already have something amazing on our hands.",Recommended

"Definately feels akin to castlevania games, specifally the main character feels like shanoa from castlevania: order of ecclesia, and the game feels amazing both astheticaly and emotionally it feels as if iga was inspired solely by that game, however i can't be sure about that. i do love how O.D. is basicly alucard x3 10/10 would play if it was the last game on earth :3",Recommended

While not everything about the game is perfect, it's still a good game. I helped Kickstart this for 5x the steam price and still think it's worth the price for the content packed together here. Just wish my ""free"" (already paid) steam Soundtrack-Code DLC arrived BEFORE or at release, since we (Backers) were paying extra for it.\n\n\nThe Steam-Key arrived release day (Late), the other backer DLC arrived late,\nbut I've still not yet received my pre-paid Soundtrack-Code.

Game of the year 2019 for me,Recommended
"Plays similarly to the Aria of Sorrow (game boy advance) series of Castlevania where you can gather not only weapons, items, and gold from monsters, but also their souls to enhance your arsenal.

Such a good game.  Has the symphony of the night feel to it but with more.  The music is outstanding.  The update art was well worth the wait.,Recommended
"Despite a few bugs this game is incredibly good. As a big fan of all the previous Igavanias, this feels like a real solid entry to the stable of other games such as Dawn of Sorrow, Aria of Sorrow and Order of Ecclesia. \n\nIt uses very similarly systems to the Sorrow titles but expands on them perfectly. The gameplay is fun and engaging with a whole slew of basic weapons such as swords, katanas, great swords, clubs, spears, stave and whips, just like in the previous Igavanias. However unlike other igavanias you can now find books with fighting game inputs in them so you can do special attacks. These are supplemented with shards containing abilities that you get at random from pretty much every monster. Giant fireballs, beams of holy light, summoning a dragon to whack things in front of you, passive bonuses, double jump etc. Depending on your build you can easily flit between Guts mode with a great sword and spamming a whole slew of magic, especially given that you don't make any real decisions when levelling up, you just alter your stats to what you want them to be for your build by changing your clothes, accessories and shards.\n\nThe game world is just as crazy and nonsensical as a Castlevania game, going from an underground desert to a whole area built around far east architecture. And there's plenty to do. NPCs at the start of the game will give you quests to fulfil in the rest of the castle. And you want to do them because there's a whole food mechanic that permanently boosts your stats every time you eat something for the first time. This can be somewhat annoying though as some ingredients are semi-rare and due to a bug with how items drop, the bag containing that last miso you needed to make a miso broth for your ramen might get stuck in a wall or become unobtainable despite being on the ground. Also it is really annoying sometimes to figure out how to progress in the world. You get a new ability that lets you traverse the world in a new and exciting way but can't for the life of you remember where the places you could use it are or how you get on to the next area. There's one point where I just walked about aimlessly, checking every room for something I might have missed, only to accidentally walk in on the one character from earlier in the game I needed to talk to who I thought was just a minor NPC essentially running a buff shop.\n\nThere's also some fun references to other games and anime, notably a couple to JoJo's Bizzare Adventure. And the voice acting crew is great. It's got David Hayter and the original VA of Alucard from Symphony of the Night. \n\nHighly recommended, especially if you liked any of the aforementioned games.",Recommended
"Nice game 9/10. The only reason I'm not super satisfied is about the graphic on PC is not super high. But considering it's Castlevania game and it's their first time showing on 2K screen as required. I think that is still OK.\n\nAs all, if you like Castlevania series game years ago, just buy, install and play.\n\n买了玩儿就完事儿了，好评",Recommended
Yeah it was cool,Recommended
This is everything you need to scratch your Castlevania itch. Just buy it amd emjoy,Recommended
"A few words. Just play it.\nSmooth and optimized, brings you a similar experience to SOTN. \n(In my opinion not as good but equally worth the time to max out)\n\nBrings you a decent story and minor secrets. It's charming.\n\nI enjoyed it and I can recommend it.",Recommended

it's pretty good. like some good ol comfort food,Recommended
Exactly what we were waiting for. <3,Recommended
"I like this game, it's definitely scratching my Castlevania itch! Things I'd love to see changed:\n-More unique abilities than simply 'Summon XYZ'\n-Clearer sprites where I don't have to guess hitboxes, especially with big bosses\n-Combat techniques are annoying to pull off. Why not simplify controls like Smash Bros? Plenty of buttons are unassigned, yet I have to jiggle directions around and worry about input not working.\n-Better Save/Teleport room distribution\n-Opening map should start centered and zoomed in on character position\n-Village should be more lively/useful.\n-Streamline cooking: the farmer seems useless because you get plenty of materials you don't need. You need to go out into the field to even make the most basic of recipies anyway, so him throwing rice at you just adds insult to injury.",Recommended

"May not be as good as Castlevania: Symphony of the Night, but it catches its spirit. Good Work, Igarashi-San.",Recommended
Amazing game. Great soundtrack. Great gameplay. Interesting story.,Recommended
"Almost at the end of this game and feel I can say that is been a brilliant experience. \nThe gameplay is spot on and a proper and Recommended Metroidvania game. \nPerformance is almost flawless. Just one major fps dip on a boss near the end of the game - dropping to 50fps - but it doesn't break the flow of the fight and imagine will be patched out anyway. \n\nThere are some moments where I got lost not knowing what to do and not having a journal with what the NPCs tell you makes it very hard for me as I am useless at remembering things that have been said. Being lost had its advantages, it made me go explore, getting many level up as a result, and finding many secrets. \n\nAll in all, its an amazing game. \nSo happy to see this turn out to be a success. \n",Recommended
"If you're a fan of the Igarashi Castlevania games, you'll love this.",Recommended
"Old school gameplay, new school game design. Probably the best Castlevania game that's not a Castlevania game in recent history. Good replayability, decent challenge and many, many throwbacks to the classics. Highly recommend if you ever even had a passing interest in Castlevania, especially Symphony of the Night.",Recommended
I love this game,Recommended
very good suce,Recommended
"Amazing game that captures that Castlevania feel.\nSometimes It could be a bit more precise in what to do next, but that's also the biggest con I could think of.\nVariety of shards (spells) and equipment allows you to customize your playing style. Yes, you will be predominantly bruteforcing through enemies, yet weapons have different attack range, speed and special moves.\nIt clearly deserves all the praise it gets.",Recommended
"This game is challenging and really fun with all the different types of abilities you can equip . Just remember to save often!! Game looks very pretty , the sounds and music are top notch! Mouse and Keyboard controls are functional but using a controller is the way to go for a smoother experience. I have not experienced any lag  or  bugs.   This game is grindy too so you need to  level up to defeat tougher bosses . There is crafting and you can buy items you want if you are short on materials for crafting, vice versa. So far, just based on 6 hours of playtime, im highly enjoying this game and this deserves a 9/10!",Recommended

"Imagine Symphony of the Night, but with modern quality of life improvements and 3d graphics. If that sounds appealing to you, you'll probably love this game.",Recommended
"This game is great and it's a lot of fun. If you love RPGs and platforming, this is a game for you.\n\nIn fact it is almost a remaster of Castlevania SOTN. The graphics are different, the map is different (although it feels very similar in many ways, probably due to the same style of level design but also because of the presence of mostly the same types of areas), the character's progression / acquisition of skills is different; but other than that every single thing in this game is individually either taken from SOTN, or evocative of something in SOTN (well, there are some, though very few, completely original ideas, although I won't spoil them here). I personally hoped that there would be a little more distinction between Castlevania and Bloodstained, but it doesn't make this a bad game in any way in my opinion.\n\nThat being said, if you haven't played Castlevania SOTN yet, I'd recommend playing that one first if you can.\n\nI loved Castlevania SOTN enormously and I've been yearning to replay it for years, but every time I'd play I'd find I lacked the motivation to progress through the whole game. I guess that it is so exploration based that when you already know all the secrets, it is not as enjoyable anymore. For me Bloodstained ROTN ended up a way to have a ""fresh"" feeling replay of the original game (well, almost - not nearly as surprising as back in the day but at least I did have many things to figure out, and I enjoyed myself very much). It felt very nostalgic.",Recommended
"A clsssic metroidvania, just like the grandma... IGA used to make 'em.\n\n(a few glitches here and there, but nothing a path or two can't fix)",Recommended
"Die, monster! You don't belong in this world!",Recommended
"As someone who backed and followed the development of RotN from the very beginning, I've been waiting eagerly for the opportunity to experience this game.\n\nBy no means is Bloodstained a perfect game, it has more than its fair share of unpolished edges, but it's exactly the game I wanted to support, and I have enjoyed playing it immensely.\nIt's definitely not for people who like modern game design principles that give you lots of clues and obvious hints about how to complete it, and find everything, and while it gives you more than enough tools to sort out the puzzles and hidden areas, you are expected to scout the castle and always pay attention to what kind of places you can revisit every time you get a new movement ability, like the classic Igavania titles from which it draws.\n\nI cannot recommend this game more for anyone who enjoys a classic 2.5D platforming exploration adventure.\nI look forward to the updates that will eventually arrive to fully flesh out the promised features.",Recommended
"If you want a game that is metroidvania style and keeps the best of the best from similar titles, you can't go wrong with this. If Castlevania Symphony of the Night was having a sequel, this would be it.",Recommended

ぶっ殺してをくれ！,Recommended
"Bloodstained is a love letter to the Castelvania series which was developed by one of Castelvania's greatest minds Koji Igarashi and supported by longtime fans. In this way, it is an undeniable success! It repackages some of the best elements of Castelvania combat (drawing especially Order of Ecclasia, Aria of Sorrow, and Dawn of Sorrow) with modern graphical elements that allow the grotesque world of monsters to glisten and shine. Still, Bloodstained draws so heavily from its inspiration that it seems to have adopted many of the same issues as its predecessors, and likely will not join them as a ""classic"" of the Metroidvania canon.\n\n[Warning nitpicking ahead XD] \n[spoiler] - The story is uninspired and predictable, especially for a fan of Castelvania, and the locations/characters are flat. \n- The world shines graphically but suffers from minor issues with framerate even on a strong system. \n- As with Soma and Shanoa, our protagonist possesses a wide range of abilities stolen from enemies, the majority of which are likely to be ignored as the player quickly recognize the small handful that are significantly more powerful.\n- This leads to easy exploitation of bosses through magic spam, and those players who forgo spam for a greater challenge will find that some boss patterns are unpredictable and some hitboxes are inconsistent with animations. This is despite some bosses being quite simple and possessing limited attack pools. Bloodless is the exception - they are a masterful boss.\n- As a result of these shortcomings in combat, few will find significant replay value despite the three difficulty options and new game+. Speedruns, for example, have already devolved to mostly ability spam. [i] Stay tuned for future character(s) [/i] [/spoiler]\n\nOn a positive note, the Bloodstained team showed immense humility and devotion to their craft by spending a year graphically redesigning the game in response to critical fan reception of early footage. This tenacity to meet expectations and willingness to heed fan opinion is amazing and deserving of support. I expect they will grow and improve with each project this team pursues. \n\n[b]TLDR:[/b] I recommend Bloodstained to all [spoiler](but perhaps on sale?)[/spoiler]! It will enchant longtime Castlevania fans with cheeky nods to the series and let newcomers explore the exceptional world of Metroidvania.",Recommended
Definitely reminds of Symphony of the night. if you're looking for something similar then it's definitely worth your time.,Recommended
good game :),Recommended

"When was the last time a game made you smile? After leaving Konami (known for delivering what fans expect...look at Metal Gear Survive and the complete experience as the creator intended...like in Phantom Pain) and accruing more than 5 million dollars in Kickstarter funding, IGA set out to create the game he and the fans wanted. He succeded. After whetting our appetite with the ""8-bit"" (and at times repetititve) Bloodstained: Curse of the Moon, the promised game, Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night, finally arrived in 2019, after some delays. Was it worth the wait? Yes, very much so. Mechanics are fun, with a ton of different weapons from all over the world: from Aztec maces to Japanese katanas, and spells suited for different playstyles even if some things feel a bit unbalanced; exploration is rewarding and compelling, in a world filled with little in jokes, jabs and obsessions the author's been known for; enemy behavior is what players expect for this kind of game, though, in a clear effort to separate (visually) from the game's roots, some enemies tend to end up as bland, unreadable or a bit unappealing: long time Belmont fans can't be fooled: those flying helmets that just happen to petrify are medusa heads. The story is standard ""if we don't stop evil the world will end"" fare; but told through an appealing protagonist: Miriam, a girl more lively and less philosophically bent than her vampiric predecessor (the world offers some of that as well). The game is built using Unreal Engine 4, the visuals are quite nice and serve the story well, though monster lighting looks a bit odd at times. Bugs are mostly little annoyances like a carpenter that keeps on working after I killed him (he has a death animation: got to see it after the 3rd time) and loot bags that can't be picked up (their contents will be yours after a while anyway). The game has an extensive crafting system: from potions to weapons to international food, one of the few I haven't found annoying and I actually perceived as useful so...kudos.\nAfter years of playing some fun games and some really boring ones...few, if any, had really made me smile, this one even, at times, made me laugh, and that's the whole point of playing a videogame: having fun. Heartily recommended.",Recommended
"Castlevania is back, baby!",Recommended
"sort of a mix between castlevania sotn and aria, more of the same but not in a bad way",Recommended
Aria of Sorrow is a good metroidvania game that may rely too much on random enemy drops.,Recommended
"If you are a fan of Symphony of the Night or any other of the ""metroidvania"" Castlevania games, you will most likely enjoy this game. The controls are responsive, there's tons of secrets to find, the bosses are great, the music is amazing... overall it is a very enjoyable experience. Even if you haven't played any metroidvania style games before, I would highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys single player action games in general.",Recommended
The return of SOTN.,Recommended
Really fun.,Recommended
"i dont have the words to say about this game is a real jewel buy it brothers grat game, great sound, and history if you like metroidvania and want to play another dimesion game i recomend you this game maybe is the next chapter of the cursed of the moon  but the fun its warranted i had some experience on my first purchase because my pc have low specs but seeing some videos and recomendations on youtube finally i can play it i feel so happy :D \n\nEs un gran juego gran sonido y acción del mismo creador de castlevania ahora la serie bloodstained continuación del hechizo de la luna si les gusta los metroidvanias comprenlo vale la pena cuando lo compre por primera vez me sentí algo frustado al inicio por no poderse jugar como debe de ser por tener una pc de baja gama pero después de chekar algunas recomendaciones y tutoriales en yutube lo volvi a comprar despues de haberlo rembolzado y finalmente lo puedo jugar y me siento muy contento si llegaran a tener algun detalle en el juego no lo regresen primero consultenme o vayan a yutub para que puedan jugarlo saludo:D",Recommended
"As one of the original backers I'm pretty annoyed that I dropped $20 extra dollars for content they just gave out for free, and while the game feels like somewhat of a letdown compared to its predecessors, it still held my interest for a while. I'm hoping some more content comes out for it. Can't give it a meh, so I'll say it's worth playing.",Recommended
"An update of Symphony of the Night in all but name. The game also borrows heavily from Soma's games involving various abilities drained from nearly every enemy in the game. Honestly, I'd say the game delivers about everything you'd assume it would, with a little extra, but delivers few surprises in story or gameplay. It's masterfully done, but it's about what you think it will be from the first time you hear about the game, good and bad. If that's what you want, the game definitely delivers, and I enjoyed my 50ish hours on the game gathering every item, shard, and entry in to the glossary. I'm still waiting to see the extra modes to be added, but the game doesn't seem to be very different between normal and hard, and by the time you legitimately open up hard and nightmare, you're already strong enough to easily skate through everything, so there's less replayability than I'd hoped. I'm still looking forward to the new add-ons though.",Recommended
This Game really deserves a sequel. 9/10,Recommended
Worth the 4 years of waiting.,Recommended
"For the price this game is currently asking for and the quality of the overall product, I cannot recommend this game and do not believe it worthy of the price I paid. This game would be good at a heavy 50% discount and even then, the final product, final boss and ending was laughable at best and in my opinion, has the worst final boss I have ever personally played against. Had I have been a backer, I would have felt scammed. The r34 is good though.",Not Recommended
"Fun, retro RPG-platformer that took me back to games I used to play 20 years ago. The game doesn't hold your hand throughout the story and you rely on subtle hints to guide you on where to go next.\n\nTowards the end of the game, assuming you try to explore every room and gain every item, your character is very powerful and very fun to play - you can brute force your way through bosses, ignoring mechanics with a few max healing potions.\n\nI'm a completionist and there is a lot to do in order to get 100%. Love this game.\n\n",Recommended
"It's a Koji classic through and through. If you liked Symphony of the Night, Dawn of Sorrow, or any of the other staple Castlevania games, give this one a try.",Recommended
:-) Buy it.,Recommended
"While it doesn't do anything all that new, it accomplishes its goal of being an Igavania with a more modern look.  It plays a bit like a cross between Castlevania: Symphony of the Night and Castlevania: Dawn of Sorrow, but without the latter's annoying seal drawing mechanic.\n\nNot all features are present in the game at the time of this review.  Most of the Kickstarter stretch goals were not done in time for the game's launch, but the developers decided to release them later rather than delay the game even more than it already has been.\n\nAll in all, it's a fun game even if it is slightly buggy... and the PC version is considerably less buggy than the console versions.",Recommended
Absolutely worth the wait. A fantastic success story for kickstarter backing and a wonderful spiritual successor. The difficulty is not so easy I can skate through with no consumables. But not so hard as to leave me frustrated with little progress to show for it.,Recommended
"Stuck at 99.80, send help",Recommended
I can feel the nostalgia already.,Recommended
Probably one of the best game that came from Kickstarter.,Recommended
"maybe sometimes a lttle flawed, but always very enjoyable anyway! the next ""igavania"" is here, and it's here to stay!!!\nif you like the genere, it's a must buy!",Recommended

"The game I have been waiting for, everything I loved about playing CastleVania: Symphony of the Night is here.\n\nThere are some technical hiccups, and the second to last area is pretty meh, but overall it's a very positive experience.",Recommended
"Bought it twice, its that nice.",Recommended
Its good,Recommended
"This really scratched the Metroidvania itch. While it didn't exactly stretch or further the genre, it is an excellent addition to it.",Recommended
Excellent reminder why vania is the better half of metroidvania.,Recommended
is gud,Recommended
"Incredible game! I did my best to prolong fighting the final boss because I didn't want it to end. If you love the metroidvania genre, you need to add this to your collection. If you're on the fence, get it anyway :)",Recommended
"The game is gorgeous in every frame and fun at every turn. Basically a Castlevania game with its best parts for this age. While I'm also an original KS backer and waited years (and even almost forgot this was coming out) for this to happen, anyone who would just discover the existence of the genre today would get swooned by this fast enough. Should be a crime to buying this at a discount, we need more gems like this.",Recommended
"Man does this game take me back to the good old days of playing Castlevania. If you truly enjoy metroidvania style games with a little bit of quirkiness, you will not go wrong with this game. Absolutely worth it!",Recommended
Do ya like Castlevania? Like all of them after Symphony of the Night? Then do I have a game for you!,Recommended
top tier :D,Recommended
Bloodstained is great reboot of the Castlevania series. It is the console sequel to symphony of the night that everyone has always wanted. It is not 2d but visual still look good. The music is wonderful. It fits the game very well. Gameplay is excellent. Exploring the well designed castle and experimenting with all different weapons and magic is very fun. And there are so many weapons and magic. There are a lot of similar games in the store now but none of them really feel like Castlevania. Bloodstained captures the gameplay feel of Castlevania fans want. It is one of the best games of the year.\n\n,Recommended

Just what the doctor ordered. A medication to scratch that Castlevania withdrawal.,Recommended
Overall a good game.\n\nLike:\n\n-Castlevania/metroid style.\n-Fun to explore the map for the first time.\n-Possibility to level up abilities and gear. (however most of the shards and skills are completely useless)\n-Feels indie/homebrew.\n\nDislike:\n\n-Feels indie/homebrew.\n-Not enough late game content. You can find 100% of secrets and demons way too fast.\n-Game crashes if you move too fast from area to another (late game only).\n-No depth in the story.\n-Lots of minor glitches.,Recommended
A great game with the feel of Castlevania. It is good to see sometimes kickstartered games turn out well.,Recommended
Pretty much everything you want from a metroidvania game.,Recommended
"I wanted a SotN clone, what I got was far more than I expected. Though it did feel like a blew through the normal mode fairly quickly. That being said I also played the crap outta SotN so I was fairly used to the style of game. 100% would 100% this game if I had the time :(",Recommended

"This is the reason the games are still called MetroidVANIA. Castlevania is alive and kicking and this game kicks some serious butt. I have SO many good memories of Castlevania: Symphony of the Night and this game is like that but on steroids. The controls are gloriously responsive and the gameplay is great. Lots of places to explore, puzzles to solve, and enemies to kill and absorb their powers! The wait was worth it in my opinion, and I am going to have to do some seriously nice things for my wife to make up for the several days I've spent playing this game instead of doing anything useful around the house.",Recommended
Been waiting more than 20 years for something like this! C:SotN was one of the greatest games of the '90s.,Recommended

"If you are a fan of Castlevania Symphony of the Night you will more than likely love this game. It plays like an updated version of that game. IMO it is Metroidvania at it's best.

"Waited a long time for this as a backer, and have to say it was worth the wait. While there are a few areas I think the game could improve, they're very minor gripes. Graphics have come a long way since first revealed, gameplay is great, music is quite good, and there are a myriad of spells and weapons to play around with. Completed everything and waiting for some of the DLC content. If you enjoy Metroidvania games I recommend giving this a shot.",Recommended
"Iga deliver, what he needs to deliver. Such nostalgic feeling from the old masterpiece. I enjoyed every second of it. Thank you so much Iga.",Recommended
"Overall a goodgame if you've enjoyed 2D Metroidvania's with some rpg elements.This game has you traversing through a castle filled with demons and obtaining skills and items that allow you navigate to sections that would not be possible.\n\nControls are nice and reminiscent of some earlier Castlevania games with the use of Animation cancelling to allow more attacks.\nThe game has various weapon types, each with their own set of attack animations that makes each weapon more suitable in some situations over others and there are also a number of Unique weapons that behave different from their counterparts.\nAlso some weapons have techniques which are performed by a combination of buttons similar to fighting gamesm when mastered you are able to perform those techniques with other weapons of the same type.\n\nThe use of Shard is the equivalent of magic in this game but being more preferrable to using weapons, I've rarely used the shards with an exception of a few, mainly those used for traveral.\n\nInitially was not a fan of the 2.5D natrure but that is only a minor gripe with a as the game does use the 3D engine to employ interesting background effects and allows for some items to change your characters appearence.\n\nOnly downpoint that I have although minor is that the character models only have lip syncing and no facial expressions but since there is little dialogue in the game, its understandable.",Recommended

"If you are at all a fan of the Metroidvania genre, then you won't want to pass this game up. Seeing as this game comes from Koji Igarashi, one of the minds that was instrumental in pioneering the Metroidvania genre, it's no wonder that the games level design feels as well thought out as it does.\n\nThe Good:\nThere is definitely a lot to like here, the controls are intuitive and responsive, the enemies and bosses are unique and varied and you have a ton of weapons, spells, perks and abilities that you can quick cycle through, which can completely change your play style at any given moment. This and the fact that there is a New Game Plus mode with a nightmare difficulty setting and a total of 13 free DLC content packs on the way, definitely make this game worth it's $39.99 asking price.\n\nThe Bad:\nThe only complaints or criticism I can think to make here is that, from time to time the games animations can feel and look a little clunky and sometimes the English voice acting is less than stellar. While we are nitpicking, there was also some moments where I thought that the game could have used a little better conveyance as to what to do next and how to progress. Luckily these scenarios are few and far between.\n\nConclusion:\nOther then that there is not much to complain about from a gameplay perspective. It's always great to see a kickstarter project that actually delivers on its promises and boy this one delivers. Fans of Symphony of the Night will be very pleased!\n\n*Throws wine glass to the ground*\n\n7.5/10",Recommended

I've had Bloodstained for less than two weeks and have spent 30 hours exploring the castle and killing demons, and I'm still not even halfway done. It scratches that Castlevania itch like no other game has. And as much as I like a certain white-haired dhampir, Miriam feels like she exudes more personality and spirit. And kudos to Iga-san for having the foresight to give her spats underneath her skirt, even if it doesn't really fit the time period.",Recommended

This game nailed it. This is how you do kickstarter.\n+ Loots.\n+ Exploration rewards you.\n+ Second playable character.\n+ Side Quests rewards you with (eventual) useful items\n+ Farming gold allows for buying items that are more powerful.\n+ Upgrade existing weapons with loots dropped from enemies.\n+ Equip new items (not armor) that visibly show on your character.\n+ Secrets on map that rewards you for finding them (though not all secrets are as rewarding)\n+ Miriam a new waifu to join the rule3...I mean the vania franchise.\n+ FREE 13 freakin' DLCs to come\n+ Boss battles are hard but rewarding.\n+ Harder difficulty modes after playing on Normal mode.\n+ Beautiful music and sound effects.\n+ Conversations with NPCs give background to the story.\n+ Fluid combat and movement. Gotta go slide....\n\n- [Spoiler] You can accidentally get the bad ending. Nothing serious but don't try to break the game storyline by rushing through it.[/Spoiler]\n- New armors do not reflect visually on Miriam. :(\n- Cliche story that we've seen a bizzillion times. \n\n\nGet it. This is a game done right and you should support the dev.,Recommended
One of those must play games,Recommended
Do yourself a favor and force supersampling in the config file,Recommended
If you loved Castlevania or Hollow Knight then you will really love this game. Multiple hours worth of game play and store. well worth the price.,Recommended
"While I want to start off by saying that my opinion is outstandingly positive, I have a number of complaints about the game.\n\nExploration: This game is both incredibly streamlined while somehow also being convoluted as hell. When you ""Explore"", you're not treated to secret areas and items that blow your mind, very often you're either ""treated"" to the right way to go, or given a chest with some materials that respawn over time. While other Igavania games reward exploration, solving puzzles and figuring out how to activate secrets that help you along your journey, Bloodstained saved all the goodies for endgame when you don't need them anymore (or to make your new game+'s an absolute joke). One of the only times there was something special to be found, I was treated to a jumpscare, absolutely murdered, and when I finally survived the fight I was treated to a completely useless soul for my trouble.\n\nWhile I'm on the topic of exploring, the part where the optional soul, that you could easily skip, is mandatory to progress could REALLY have been made better. I spent hours combing every inch of that castle because I didn't get the proper soul after killed 3 of the specific enemy while I was in the specific area. Also, the certain armor that's mandatory to progress could stand out more. I filled in that portion of the map without actually being there, so I didn't see the chest with the armor and spent even more hours than the previous trial. I was trying to get 1 of every soul thinking I missed something important (like the first time), and would've continued if my friend hadn't googled how to progress.\n\nEquipment: I hope you like crafting, because if you want your gear to keep up with you, you better get used to it. As mentioned above, very little worthwhile equipment is actually found in the castle, the majority of it needs to be made by you. Materials can be found in respawning chests throughout the castle, bought from the shop, or looted randomly from monsters. Now, this isn't exactly a bad thing. I actually enjoy grinding materials to buff myself up as good as I can before a new area makes all my effort invalid, but it ain't for everyone. Lots of endgame items, and it's incredibly easy to make the game a cakewalk if you take the time to make some equipment.\n\nGame in general: This game isn't short, but it feels like it. At the time of this review, I've spent 30 hours in the game, and that includes: Countless hours of running around not knowing a solution, getting at least one of every soul (while grinding and maxing out my favorites), finishing all the quests, crafting (so much crafting), leaving it on while I cooked dinner, revisiting areas I've already been to make sure I didn't miss anything, etc etc etc. While it took me over 30 hours first playthrough, I'm positive you could do it in under 10 easily.\n\n The (real) ending was lackluster, it felt like it wasn't supposed to actually end there (and maybe future updates are the cause?), the plot twist was incredibly predictable, main characters died left and right without any emotions from anyone, and the only time I felt anything close to empathy to a character was at the beginning when the poor sailor dude got merc'd by squidward. Granted, this normally isn't the type of game where a great story is required, so I'd normally give it some leeway..... BUT, it has a great story that's poorly executed, which makes the situation all the more glaring.\n\nGameplay: At the beginning, combat is incredibly clunky (apart from a few specific weapons). If you want any sort of good time with the game, you're almost required to upgrade a passive soul to increase your attack speed. Spells are so expensive that I did not touch any of it for a majority of the game, aside from the beginning when my weapons were too slow to allow me some proper combat. \n\n\nNow, the good points.\n\nLiterally everything else. \nMovement is fluid, the protagonist handles like a dream, no part of the game felt ""cheap"" (aside from Mr Jumpscare), and aside from the two situations I had you should never get lost. \nThe quests were good as active tutorials, sending you to good areas, reminding you to craft and cook foods, etc. \nEnemies, both familiar and new, challenged you so you wouldn't fall asleep but wouldn't make you sweat either. \nThe music, my god the music.\nThe variety of weapons, while half of them are awful to wield at the start, they become viable and tons of fun later.\nThe visuals are very nice, definitely not an eyesore. \n\nI'm eagerly awaiting new characters to play as, as well as coop as well as the other very promising updates that will be on their way. Please don't feel put off by the large section of criticism, it's good to know the low points ahead of time so the rest of the game shines that much more.",Recommended
"so far its pretty good, and have a good potential to be great",Recommended
Good,Recommended
"Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night is fun Igaviania that is worth the buy. If you've been waiting for another Castlevania in this style, this should be your first pick. It has Symphony of the Night's level design but uses the Sorrow duology and Order of Ecclesia mechanics but with a fresh take. The music is extremely well crafted and blends with the environments. One thing that Bloodstained does not suffer from is bad pacing like Symphony of the Night does, especially once you collect all of Alucard's best gear. Here all the bosses gives you a challenge and each one feels rewarding to beat. The shard system is well handle and you'll mostly likely get about 60% of them if you play though it casually. This is such a fantasic middle finger to Konami than Might No. 9 was to Capcom. I hope they will be more to come to this. Thank you Iga for making a fantastic game that I know I will have endless fun with.",Recommended

"I'm not a fan of Metroidvania games in general, but Bloodstained combines a great art-style with fluent gameplay.\n\nOverall the utility-gated exploration was more fun to me than it was a hassle, and unlocking new abilities was always exciting.\n\nThere are some small quality of life improvements compared to other MV-games I've seen. For example if you're destroying environmental objects, they'll drop a mana-restorative item if you need mana, and a money item if you don't.\nThis creates a small risk and reward system, where you're rewarded with some cash if you're not using your spells. \n\nThe only problem I had with the game is that every now and then my input got dropped, which lead to two game overs and falling off of platforms instead of jumping.\n\nAll in all I can only recommend the game, and I'm looking forward to the content that will be delivered post-launch. The game's base content is worth buying on it own nevertheless.",Recommended

"Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night is an OK to good game. Score: 7/10\n\n+It lets you explore the castle and backtrack easily, which is the main draw that got me really into playing more. \n\n+You have your choices in weapons (shoes/kicks, sword, greatsword, katana, whip, gun, spear, special tools, etc.) \n\n+You have your choices in abilities and summons. Find a main setup that will carry you through the game. You can switch setups with ease using ""shortcuts"".\n\n+You can customize Miriam. Change her hair, eye color, and outfit.\n\n-I got stuck at some parts in the story, but a little Google-fu at those parts helps immensely. It boils down to ""use this shard ability  here"" and twice ""you need this item, find it, wear this item here.""\n\n-The game felt somewhat short, but the game is like $40. I spent some time grinding out levels, shards, gold, and items.\n\n+Finding secrets is kind of fun. Screw Monster #44.\n\n-Final boss is not that hard, but I cannot really comment on it. I became super overpowered after grinding before the fight. It's better to say the fight was not interesting with all of the attacks I saw in my gameplay.\n\n-Final boss area looks eh and did not feel like the final destination. \n\n-Graphics is not that great, but it does look polished.\n\n-Main story is not that great. Backstory can be read from the bookshelves. In particular, my game crashed twice due to interacting with the bookshelves. Save first before reading. \n\n+Music is good. Sound is eh. I used Japanese Voice and it was good.\n\n-Bugs are in the game. I mean the game kind. I mentioned bookshelves and the other is getting stuck in water without the shard ability. I was able to escape with Waystones, so have some on hand.\n\nBest thing about this game: Castlevania gameplay, especially near the end. Go Sonic the Hedgehog fast. Do damage. Tank most things.\n\nWorst thing about this game: Story. It is not bad as it makes sense. The main story needed a bit more fleshing out, which would make the game longer for the better, and enhance or smooth progression. Final boss motive is eh. You do need to pay attention to some dialogue for hints to progress. You can get a bad ending for playing the game ""normally,"" but apparently it is expected. Good ending is also eh. \n\nSide Note: I paid $175 for the game and more, so I give a little more care about this game. It has its flaws, but I did have fun. However, the spin-off Curse of the Moon had better boss fights for $10.",Recommended
anyone who has played Castlevania Sotn or castlevania Dawn of sorrow or Aria of Sorrow.. you guys will love this game if you liked those titles.. this game is so good its worth atleast 1 play through and boss battle mode is fun. i usually don't do multiple play thrus on a  game like this but i may return to it later time.. there is a lot of quest for items and crafting system seems a little over burdening at first. i didn't mess with crafting until i was close to endgame.  all in all if i was to scale this game on a scale id give it a 9/10.. only cause the crafting seems a little overbearing at times and the 2.5D looks werid on certain parts where it looks like its trying to be full 3d.. but all in all good game worth buying if you love those good castlevania metrovania style games..,Recommended

For all intents and purposes, Bloodstained is the Castlevania sequel fans of the franchise have been pining for since Order of Eccelsia. It feels [i]just[/i] right.

Believe me when I tell you not to miss out on this game. Story is pretty damn good too, with multiple endings based on what you do. Secret rooms, crazy drops, and customizing your Miriam to how you see fit. (Mine looks like a bad bitch).

"Bloodstained has fixed 1 critical issues from other Castlevania style, while at the same time having other issues.\n\nWhy you would enjoy Bloodstained: \n[b]Gameplay: [/b]\n\n- Rich magic casting, shard/souls system -> Allowed you diverse your gameplay. These spells can also be upgraded, crafted into a new spell completely.\n- Technique (weapon art) further improve gameplay style. Majority weapons come with secret skill, technique, using it is very much similar to input combo skill in fighting game. When you gain enough exp for a technique, it is then unlocked to \nother weapons with same type. However, Bloodstained makes it quite difficult to execute those combos via controller consistently compare to keyboard. (Meanwhile, it is the reverse with fighting game)\n- Nerf healing: Many other castlevania game can be cheesed with lots of healings, not this one.\n\nHaving rich experience in other castlevania style, I ease through bloodstained in normal difficulty with ease. Compare to other Castlevania, Bloodstained can be regarded as one of the most difficult by actively nerfing healing option. Beside limited amount of healing you can bring, crafting healing is also expensive, spell that can provide healing often close to useless.\n\nSpoiler warning: Reading the spoiler will make the game becomes too easy. One the key issues that make this game easy, is how overpowered [spoiler]jump kick[/spoiler] is in Bloodstained. Majority of bosses is extremely weak against [spoiler] jump kick [/spoiler] by having no skills that can counter repeated [spoiler] jump kick [/spoiler] \n\n[b]Story[/b]: You don't come for Castlevania style game for story. It has always been lousy and cliche except for few entries in the franchise. The story of bloodstained is good at world building, creating potential hype for future games. Meanwhile, characters development is as cliche as it can be, and you feel little to zero compassion with the characters.\n\n[b]Music[/b]: Recommendedly a masterpiece, you dont feel bored with the music and found them seamlessly flow into you. There is no epic soundtrack, it just naturally poured into you.\n",Recommended

"I've been holding my breath for this one. I was too late for the Kickstarter campaign, but ever since I learned about the game, my mantra was: ""please don't suck, please don't suck, please don't suck"". Now it's out, and... Yeah, that's everything I wanted it to be! It's Castlevania: Order of Ecclesia, but waaay bigger, with a world that just keep being bigger, and a crafting system to top it off. Castlevania lives again, all heil IGA!\nNow, what I'm going to say next isn't a criticism of the game, but an observation. I'm enjoying it, but it might be a dealbreaker for some. This game is not skill-based, it's exploration-based. It's wide, not deep. When you hit a hard part, it doesn't make you try it again a hundred times until you git gud — instead you go back to collect some ingridients, get yourself better gear and increase your stats. It favors a slow, methodical approach and hardly ever puts you in a pinch. And the bosses are the game's weakest part: they have simple patterns, forgettable designs and go down without much struggle.\nAgain: I loved exploring the castle, gradually building up my power and becoming a juggernaut that rolls over the previously difficult levels. The game is tons of fun. But don't expect a challenge. I'm not even comparing it to Hollow Knight — Gato Roboto made me hone my skills more than Bloodstained.",Recommended
"I really enjoyed the game, finished it (without searching stuff up on youtubes etc.) in 24h in-game time, got annoyed at some points in the game where you simply don't get any clues (after killing the twin dragons took me like 2h to discover what to do next), but overall was a really fun experience.",Recommended

If so, this is the game for you. This game was Kickstarted back in 2015 with an unusual method to it: The game had potential full funding waiting in the wings, but they first had to prove to the investors that people wanted this sort of game. As such, the KS funds were to be used primarily for improvements to the base game and a slew of add-ons and new options in the form of stretch goals. The team making the game was headed up by Koji  “Iga” Igarashi, one of the minds behind the great CV:SotN, among other games in the series.\n\nFortunately for them, the fans answered the call, to the tune of over $5.5 million pledged by nearly 65,000 total backers. This was enough to convince the investors to pull the trigger; now, despite s speed bump or two along the way, we have Ritual of the Night: a love letter to all things Castlevania...just from Konami, but from many, many of the folks who helped to create the MV genre, including composers, artists, programmers, and more – fellow ex-Konami employees of Iga's included.\n\nTHE FLOW AND THE STORY: In the late 1700's, The Alchemist Guild decided to seek power beyond what any human could achieve on their own. In order to do this, they began all sorts of experiments on fellow humans, such as embedding powerful magic crystals of demonic origin into their subjects' bodies. Those subject who survived the process were able to control these fell powers, and were known as “Shardbinders.” Naturally, the alchemists went a bit too far, ripping open a passageway into the realm of the demons, causing widespread death and destruction.\n\nFast forward by ten years, and, of course, nobody has learned a damn thing. The alchemists are up to their old tricks, and a huge, foreboding castle has appeared out of nowhere. Your character, Miriam, is one of the last two Shardbinders left, as the alchemists have sacrificed all of the others in search of even greater power. Taking care of things falls squarely into your lap, of course. Wander around the castle, leveling up, finding (or crafting) cool new gear, slaughtering demons and taking their powers, until you can finally confront the guy who decided to bring the demons back (no, it's not Dracula, nor even one of his kind). You get a robust home base (with a crafter, a farmer, a shop, and no fewer than three folks sending you on fetch quests for some nice rewards, a save room, and a warp room nearby) once the game proper begins, and you'll need it. So, go forth!...Oh, and try not to let your shard/corruption level get too high. That would be bad. \n\nCONTROLS: Keyboard or controller (auto-recognized). Note that there is an option that reduces the (intentional) slight input lag in the game; the lag in on by default. Generally speaking: Smooth an intuitive, with some interesting new additions such as moving the right stick in order to hold Miriam's arm out (in any direction) in order to target certain abilities and to open magically-sealed doors. Otherwise, SotN fans will feel right at home. Of special note: certain weapons in the game can use special attacks – anything from throwing projectiles to power attacks to parries (and even auto-counters!). Once you get enough experience using a given special attack (hit and kill enemies with it; standing there and whiffing doesn't count!), you will Master that skill and gain the ability to use it with any weapons from that category...and man are there plenty of weapon types! You have the standard fare such as standard swords, broadswords, katanas, whips, etc, but you also have literal combat boots (which strengthen your slide move), staves, rapiers, and even guns! Note that guns have unlimited (weak) ammo, so they're always usable, but they can be powered up by equipping bullets with armor-piercing capabilities and more; all equipped bullets are stronger than what the base gun can do, often by a significant amount. Each weapon type feels different from the others – each with its own advantages (e.g. range, coverage, damage) and drawbacks (lack of range, speed, recoil) to account for. \n\nGRAPHICS: Oooo, pretty. Lots of attention to detail, a thoroughly gothic-esque look. One major thing to the team's credit is that they took player criticism to heart when people complained (and did they ever complain) about the poorly-lit, washed-out look of the playable beta that came out a good while prior to the actual game...so much so that they extended the release date specifically to answer their players' concerns, resulting in a much more polished look to the final product.\n\nSOUND: Music primarily by the lady who composed the SotN soundtrack, Michiru Yamana; as well as by Ippo Yamada, a veteran of the Mega Man series . . . and it shows. Classic and fitting. Thanks to the stretch goals, we also have David “Solid Snake” Hayter and Robbie “Alucard” Belgrade along for the ride, lending their voice talents to the project. There are even easter eggs – sit down at a piano, and Miriam will begin playing. If your faery Familiar is active at the time, it will sit on your shoulder and it will sing the song as you play. \n\nOVERALL: You liked Symphony? Go buy this game. Simple as that. Not sure? Play the free demo and then see what you think. It's also actively being patched in response to customer commentaries. Note that there are some issues with the Switch port as of launch, but the patch should be up by the time this review is published.\n\nSupports full voiceovers in English and Japanese at the moment (more may be added in the future); eleven languages supported via text. \n\nSYSTEM REQUIREMENTS:\nPer console or, for Steam/GOG:\n\nMINIMUM:\nProcessor: AMD FX-4350 / Intel Core i5-4460\nMemory: 4 GB RAM\nGraphics: AMD Radeon R9 280X / GeForce GTX 760\nStorage: 10 GB available space\nAdditional Notes: If you have a potato PC or above, you're ok.\n\nRECOMMENDED:\nProcessor: AMD FX-6300 / Intel Core i5-4590\nMemory: 8 GB RAM\nGraphics: AMD Radeon R9 290 / GeForce GTX 1050 Ti\nStorage: 10 GB available space\nAdditional Notes: The only potatoes you use are the tasty kind.\n\n\nREVIEW BY: Eric_Kei\n\nSTORY: 90\nGAMEPLAY: 100\nGRAPHICS: 95\nSOUND: 100\nFUN FACTOR: 95\nATMOSPHERE: 95\n\nPros: \nBeautiful graphics\nAmazing soundtrack\nA return to the glory days of Igavania games\nHandy-dandy Shortcut system to allow you to change out entire gear/shard sets on the fly\nMore than a dozen DLC's incoming over the next few months, with some already implemented; these were the KS stretch goals, so they're free to backers. Pricing not yet announced for other buyers (likely some free, some cheap)\n\nCons:\nMany of the incredibly detailed background elements are just that – background fluff\nAt times, almost too many options to decide on just one in each slot",Recommended

"Probably the best indie game release this year yet and probably the indie game of the year. I'm a backer of the Kickstarter and i have to say i had lots of doubts. But i was pleased with Curse of the Moon and as much with Ritual of the Night. Iga brought it! After a few hours playing i totally forgot i wasnt playing a Castlevania game. It's as close to Castlevania Symphony of the Night as it can be and stay away from Konami's (uhhh!) grasp.\n\nThe game is not perfect, but the game's issues dont take away the fun factor. If you like Castlevania Symphony of the night and/or metroidvanias. GRAB IT!",Recommended

I didn't think this was my kind of game at first... but the longer I play it the more I see the love and detail that went into creating this masterpiece and love note to all Castlevania fans. What a great game.,Recommended
"As a fan of Castlevania, and with Soma's games (Aria of Sorrow and Dawn of Sorrow) being my favorites, this game has been everything I've wanted out of it. Great soundtrack, looks good, and fun gameplay. If you've got any interest in it, give it a shot.",Recommended

"Great Metroidvania game in the vein of the old PS1/GBA/DS Castlevania games. It feels like a Recommended sequel - except for the lack of intellectual property rights, of course. The controls, items, progression, exploration, and combat all match the standards of the series. I had two main frustrations with the game. The first was monster drops getting stuck in walls very frequently. You have to wait there for a while for the game to give you the stuck drops, which means that the devs probably knew about the bug and put in a workaround. My other big complaint is that there are a couple of things that progress the story that aren't very clear, leading to the possibility of getting 100% stuck for a while wandering aimlessly until you either stumble across it or Google it. Overall, though, I highly recommend this game to anyone who was a fan of the 2D Castlevania games.",Recommended
"If you loved Castlevania, this game brings all the nostalgia to the symphony of the night. This game is awesome.",Recommended

"I'm not saying that I played this for 27 hours non stop, I'm saying that I didn't regret it.\n\nHonestly, if you played any Igavania before, you're gonna like this, at least a little bit. There's issues, few glitches, some models could've used some more work like the book familiar, but honestly the gameplay is just what I wanted, and, what I needed after all these years without a proper Igavania game since K-chan is kinda ded.\n\nDominique is Best Girl, fight me.",Recommended
Im not done with the game but so far its super good,Recommended
"This is pure IGAvania following from all the GBA and DS Castlevanias (except Lords of Shadow)\n\nThe graphics have a bit of jank to them, but the gameplay is still solid.",Recommended

Would Recommend 100%,Recommended
This is a great game... definitely scratches an itch I've been needing scratched for ages.,Recommended
"One of the best platformers I've played this decade, along with Ori and the Blind Forest",Recommended
"I know it just launched, but, we need a sequel! It's THAT good!\nAll other reviews already said and stated all the positive/negative qualities of this game; instead I want to focus on the voice acting alone; because if you're like me, good VAs elevate a game and you can enjoy the experience fully, by being invested in the story/characters.\n\nEnglish VAs are very good, kind of corny sometimes, but in a good way.\nHayter is the best, but sometimes his voice (for good or bad) is too close to the Snake one from MGS. I guess that's unavoidable. Nevertheless, he invests himself on his character, Zangetsu, and it shows.\nAlfred's VA is a close second. He's good but has a particular scene in which he's fantastic. A very good job.\nAnd then, Miriam's English VA.... she does a professional job, but she lacks emotion on her acting. There's a lot of times (especially on the emotional parts, the most important ones) she sounds just... bored. Or like she doesn't care. Therefore the character/story just doesn't have the impact it needs, and it can turn it into a nuisance, rather than something you'd enjoy. A shame really, because her voice fits perfectly!\nGebel was decent enough, and the rest of the cast is ok.\n\nJapanese VAs overall, are the better deal on this game.\nGebel and Alfred's actors are nice (Gebel's voice though, is very low, can hardly hear him sometimes), and might debate whether the english ones are better or not, but Miriam's Japanese VA is just way, way above her english counterpart. She shines and elevates this game. She's simply amazing; goes through a lot of emotions on her performance, and all of them are perfectly executed: you can feel her fury, her sadness. Not only talking about story performance; the way she screams the attack's names, the magic ones, or the hits, etc. I can't state this enough, she made the game a lot better than it already is. Big kudos to her!\n\nMy recommendation? play this game with Japanese voices, and English subs. You wont' regret it. Don't miss Miriam's Japanese performance! Even though the subs don't match exactly what the actors are sometimes saying, it's the better way to play this game, definitely. English voices are not bad, but the japanese ones (especially Miriam's) are superior.",Recommended
Best Waifuvania ever!,Recommended
"A modern Castlevania. You can expect more abilities, customization, crafting, secrets, and unique equipment in the game than you'll ever need.",Recommended
"this game is great. plenty of content, little hidden bits, details and secrets in the map, spells and weapons to use, everything! the game feels very flushed out and the promise of more free dlc seems almost too good to be Recommended.\n\npick it up if u like metroidvanias!",Recommended
This game combines some of the best elements of castelvania while giving it a fresh spin on familiar mechanics,Recommended
"Fantastic Metroidvania game, way better than I anticipated.",Recommended
"Fantastic game, Castlevania Symphony of the Night in all but name.",Recommended
Such a good metroidvania game.  Kudos to Iga-san team and everyone that back this game.,Recommended
"It's one of those games that we cherish and love, thanks to our past with the Castlevania Franchise.\n\nThis game has all the features that Metroidvania games have had in the past couple decades, which is a really good thing.\nWe're all happy that this game had the love and passion of when making this game, and we all can see it as we play - the details and the game play is surely great.\n\nThough, there is just one nitpick I have, is when the treasure bag keeps getting stuck within floors/walls, depending on where the enemies were killed - mainly within the floors/walls.\nIt's not really that much of a big deal, just have-to wait several seconds in order to 'land' and finally be able to pick up.\nThat bug might get fixed, but who knows? It's relatively minor and not game-breaking.\n\nOther than that, this game is pretty much solid and awesome to play.\n\nDefinitely recommend for all to play~ Especially for the people who love to go through the nostalgia trip with the game play style.",Recommended
Great game if you want a good'ol igovania.,Recommended

"Great game, i was expecting that familiar castlevania feel and  BRoTN has it in buckets. I can't recommend it enough!",Recommended
"Sorry to keep this short but honestly if you love the castlevania series, this game is that on steroids. I remember the old castlevania on the DS and this game is like that but current gen.\n\n10/10 one of the best rpg sidescrolling adventure games I've played in the years, well worth the current price tag.",Recommended
"iga has had almost 30 years of experience making masterpieces for konami, and this game may be his magnum opus.",Recommended
"Bought it because missed ""Symphony of the night"" so much, and this game delivered as expected. Although in terms of story they are huge in difference.\n\nIf you loved ""Symphony of the night"", you're gonna love this one.\n\nThough in my opinion the game could use more additions to areas and also the addition of checkpoints in between areas transition would be awesome, for when we are somewhat reckless at times.",Recommended
"What can I say about this game other than that it's near perfect? It's got great visuals and music and feels a lot like a Castlevania game. My only downside to it is that around midway through the game, it becomes a little unclear where to go, but after that it picks back up. The story is interesting, but not too deep or impactful and the character customization is pretty fun.",Recommended
This game is fantastic. Nice work IGA!,Recommended
"Truly the spiritual successor to Symphony of the night.  Quite enjoyable.\n\nPros:  Vibrant graphics\n           Beautiful music\n           Interesting story\n           Voice acting is very well done.\n\nCons:  Not always apparent where to proceed next on a few occasions which can be a bit frustrating.\n\nIs it worth the full price?  I would say yes if you enjoyed SOTN, Circle of the Moon and the like.  You may also find it worth the price if you simply enjoy metroidvania games in particular.",Recommended
"The spiritual successor to Symphony of the Night delivers a delightful, easter eggs filled adventure.",Recommended
"An excellent Metroidvania, and one of my favorite games of the year.",Recommended
"Really nice, would recommend it to anyone who likes metroidvania games. Crafting with the resources isn't difficult. A bit grindy now and then, but it'd be OP if you could get anything whenever you want. Combat is very nice. Challenging bosses, but not unfair.",Recommended
good,Recommended
Fantastic Metroidvania type game.\n\nI look forward to when the rest of the free DLC will be released.,Recommended
"This game was awesome! super indepth. if you like hollow knight, sotn, or anything metroidvania then you're going to love this game.",Recommended
"Addictive game with great gameplay and mechanics all around, the only downside is like every game, it eventually ends.",Recommended
"Do you like Aria of Sorrow? Do you like Dawn of Sorrow, excluding the random jump to anime art style?\n\nThis is basically another Castlevania: Sorrow game. And that's just fantastic.\n\nThere's plenty of details to go through on why that's great, but trust me, this is what a good Metroidvania is.",Recommended
5/5 if you like metroidvanias.,Recommended
"I've been dying for a new Metroidvania-style game ever since I finished Hollow Knight, and by god, this does not disappoint. I'm already into my second playthrough, and I don't normally replay a game like this right after finishing it once. I think that says a lot about how amazing it is!",Recommended
This is everything I wanted out of a new Metroidvania style game.,Recommended
"I patiently waited for this game to come out and I'm so glad I did....Iga has done it again and created yet another masterpiece. I'm taking my time with it as i did with SOTN when i first played it at 6 years old. This game has brought back so many memories of my childhood, mostly of playing SOTN with my mom who recently passed away...This game couldnt have come at a better time in my life. 10/10.",Recommended
"If you're a fan of older exploration based Castlevania games, colloquially known as metroidvanias, then I would highly recommend picking this up",Recommended
I was surprised by just how much I enjoyed this game.  The massive amount of different weapons and shards allow tons of different play styles to be fun and viable.,Recommended
Perfect,Recommended
"TONS OF FUN, such an amazing Metroidvania",Recommended
Classic Metroidvania,Recommended
"If you enjoyed Castlevania SotN you will greatly enjoy this game.  There are a few minor bugs, the worst being loot bags dropping where they cannot get picked up, but if you wait around for 30-60 seconds they should open automatically.  Other than that great spiritual successor to SotN.",Recommended
All I can say is buy wthis game as soon as possible. Free content updates are comin and i cannot wait,Recommended
"It's one of the best games of 2019 I played so far. Not quite a masterpiece, but it's still freakin awesome. \n\nCompleting the game 100% is a pain in the arse, but hey, more free DLC COMING BABY.",Recommended

Just what it says on the tin.  It's Iga-vania.,Recommended
Honestly you could have fooled me into thinking that this actually was one of the DS Castlevania games with 3D graphics.,Recommended
"Spiritual successor of SOTN without any doubt. Wish it were longer, but great game anyways.",Recommended
Excellent successor to the Castlevania series. Plays like a combination of the last three DS Castlevania games. ~20-30hrs to beat with near 100% completion.,Recommended
"Bloodstained is the most Castlevania game to ever not be a Castlevania game, and I mean that in the best way possible. There have been many Metroidvania games in the past few years, but few have had that specific Castlevania feel. Bloostained nails it, from the movement to the enemy design to the castle layout. If you enjoy past entries, especially the handheld games, this will be right up your alley.",Recommended

Excellent homage and spiritual successor to Symphony of the Night and other similar Castlevania games. Highly recommended if you enjoy metroidvania style games.,Recommended
You want a Metroidvania done freaking perfectly?  Here you go.,Recommended
"2.5D Castlevania like game. Great graphics, great music, great game play. But price tag might be a bit expensive for now.",Recommended
"Imagine Castlevania: Symphony of the Night. Now imagine it made in a modern engine, with polished graphics, a more refined magic system, even more stuff to collect, a bunch of pot shots at Konami, and a big tittied protagonist.\n\nIt is basically a 1:1 recreation of the feel of traversing Dracula's Castle in SotN. There is even a bit of paralax, and the classic load zones separating the different parts of the mansion. Every part of the world feels different, and there are hundreds of weapons, abilities, and monsters. Replacing the spells and special abilities is a Shard system that works essentially the same, but brings it all into a single set of mechanics. If I had anything negative to say here, it's that weapons have been too streamlined. I liked having the option to use two weapons, or a weapon and shield, and some of the weird combos that could sometimes make.\n\nNow, when I say it's a mirror of SotN, I mean that for good and for ill. The game seems to almost revel in being incomprehensible sometimes. Controls aren't always called out, the map icons don't have a legend, and you are given hints on where to go exactly once. Additionally, as a grindy completionist, I advise not grinding too hard on your first pass. It makes the harder modes far too easy, and you'll breeze through them. Grinding also becomes much easier on the harder modes, as they add enemy spawn locations.",Recommended
"If you like the other Igavanias, you'll like this.",Recommended
super fun,Recommended
"Has kept me occupied almost daily since release. Def recommend, despite the hiccup for the aquatic shards.",Recommended
Buy if you're fan of 2D Castlevania; don't expect anything groundbreaking though.,Recommended
Yep it hits all the marks for a successor for Sotn. Just one gripe the bosses are pushovers in normal .,Recommended
"150 tier backer here-Absolutely love this game it brings back all the emotions that i felt when i first played SOTN wondering whats around the next corner,looking at all the eye candy in the levels (this is as much of a game as it is art),frustration,challenging but fair boss fights that aren't basically interactive cinematic like they are in most modern games and THE MUSIC!\n\nThe only irksome thing I have encountered is that some of the special weapon moves are impractical to use during combat they are either too complex to reliably execute or are simply not worth doing because the standard attack is more powerful. \n\nother then that I hope there will be more DLC in the future further expanding the castle.",Recommended
KILL THOSE MURDERERS DEAD!!!,Recommended
"Usually i don't bother with posting reviews or things like that but if you have played previous castlevania games (the 2D ones) you´ll notice it´s sort of a good mix between SotN and AoS or DoS with a little touch of Ecclesia and the OST reminds me of CoD, again Michiru Yamane nailed it.\nIt´s a must buy for castlevania fans.",Recommended
The classic Metroidvania we've been waiting for.,Recommended

Don't really like it at first. I'm not really into side scroll games.\nSo i became an addict and spent my weekend time to complete this game. Woohoo.\n,Recommended
"Its quit the game, a few bugs here and there dont change the fact, that this is probably the most refined MetroidVANIA game you´ll ever play. You will like this if you like any of the DS GBA or Playstation Titles.",Recommended
It's ok,Recommended
"A very good successor to the older style of 'vanias; the game is most similar to the Sorrow games on GBA and DS with Soma Cruz, wherein you absorb power from monsters and can customize your playstyle with different abilities. Does a very good job of both standing on its own while still honoring older titles.",Recommended
"Extremely fun. Music is great, different weapons and gear actually affects the gameplay, map design is genius, gameplay never gets old, and there's tons of content. Difficulty is far more balanced than Symphony of the Night, and the game has its own style. However, the graphics (despite showing a lot of improvement since the graphics update) could be more polished, and the story is nothing special. The game has its fair share of strange moments and odd design choices, but I didn't even care about its shortcomings because I was having so much fun.\nYou don't have to be a Castlevania fan to enjoy this game. I have never played any Castlevanias and have no nostalgia for the series, but I still loved Bloodstained.\nA great spiritual successor to the Castlevania franchise. I really hope to see more Bloodstained games in the future.",Recommended
"This game, Castlevania SOTN Feels. I love it, There are even some places that reference the castle.",Recommended
I can't recommend this game enough. It really brings back the feeling of the Castlevania games I grew up on.,Recommended

A game that finally knows the art of a good game. Feels like it's been years since i have felt that feeling.,Recommended
great game,Recommended

So gooooooooooood,Recommended
"Absolutely amazing Metroidvania, sad I didn't back the Kickstarter so I could see it as it developed.",Recommended
"A good time.  Nothing too revolutionary, but still an absorbing and well-crafted Igavania.",Recommended
"If you like Symphony of the Night and the GBA/DS Castlevania games, then this is a no brainer purchase.  It's everything you want from a Castlevania game and feels exactly the way you would want a Recommended Castlevania to feel.  I am seriously loving this game and hope to get in multiple playthroughs, it's that good.",Recommended
"Bloodstained is a fantastic expansion of SotN's mechanics, giving much more reason to come back and keep playing and replaying in my opinion. Otherwise though the game is probably exactly what you expect; a solid AF metroidvania game with great control, music, art STYLE, and a lot of content. Only real complaints I have for this game is that the English VA is kinda sub par sometimes (thankfully most of the characters are fine but a few come off as QA testers doing VA work) and the fact that the grind for some of the items needed to upgrade certain shards can be pretty brutal.  If you like this kind of game, it's totally worth checking out even at full price.",Recommended
"Really fun, takes a long time to complete, some of the secrets could have been better hidden like castlevania SOTN, but it was still amazing, I enjoyed every second of playing it and 100% map completion was a very satisfying and rewarding challenge. Gave me flashbacks to my first 200% SOTN completion, thank you Koji",Recommended
A fun time for any Metriodvania fan.\nAlso take some time to level up while farming items whenever you have trouble and you'll be able get through.,Recommended
"Mechanics and exploration feel amazing. Needs some more polish and bug-fixing, but I have no regrets backing this!",Recommended
"Hey, It's pretty good.",Recommended
"As a huge SOTN fan, This game has not failed me. I'll start with the only bit of negative feedback I've heard about. There have been some reports of crashes and bugs but I honestly only experienced one crash on launch day and absolutely zero of the ""common"" bugs and most people I've seen have had no issue. The game is incredibly well optimized despite these reports.\n\nNow onto the positives, of which there are many. \n\nIncredible music, gameplay is solid, Character progression feels good and the collection keeps you bust after your first playthrough. Add to that NG+ and nightmare difficulties and there's a good amount of content here. Iga has promised free DLC which I'm very excited for and I'm currently in the midst of 100%'ing my item guide while simultaneously attempting some obscure build (Guns only, Dulla familiar+Jackpot red shard) on nightmare. \n\n-Good amount of replayability\n-Killing Bosses can be 1 or all 3 of a mix of skill, luck, and character building.\n-Lots of side quests and fulfilling ""chores"" to keep you busy\n-Multiple endings\n-Speed run, NG+, and boss run mode\n-Great music.\n-Super angsty gothic anime story paired with really cheesy, over-the-top voice acting (THIS IS A GOOD THING!) from the actors in Iga's last game SOTN and the guy who played Snake in MGS. \n\nI'm biased but honestly you're missing out if you don't give this game a try. You can wait for it to be on sale but the developers will absolutely put your money to good use and they deserve all the support and praise they've received. Plus the Developer took all kickstarter feedback and delivered in full with plenty more on the way including FREE upcoming DLC like :\n\n-Coop mode\n-Extra Characters\n-Extra Chapters\n-Endless Mode\n... and more.\n\n10/10 Iga is a Recommended craftsman. Not to mention, At the end of the day, you just gotta ask yourself... ""What is a man!?""",Recommended
"In its current state, I would not recommend buying this game unless you are already a fan of the SoTN style Castlevania games. This game is amazing, just very buggy. Most of the bugs are fine and don't detract too much; But the numerous crashes are a major problem if you plan on playing in long sessions. If you can get passed the bugs you will find one of the best metroidvania games of the decade. I'm confident that developer will fix these issues in the future. But until then buy at your own risk!",Recommended
"I would consider myself a ""metroidvania"" noob. I played 2D side-scrollers mostly as a kid in the 80s but when gaming evolved to more realism I shifted to those experiences. I am now mostly into 3D action/adventure RPG and FPS games. However, this one caught me by surprise. I really enjoyed the exploration and the variety of weapons, powers, upgrades and hidden secrets. They really kept me interested and at times I had a hard time putting the game down. I enjoyed this game a lot...so much so that since I've finished this game I've decided to play other similar games in this genre such as Hollow Knight and Dead Cells. Probably my top game of this year, just ahead of Resident Evil 2, Sekiro and Devil May Cry 5. Never thought I would say that.",Recommended
"Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night can only properly be described as a wonderfully crafted love letter to the Castlevania series. If you've been aching for a new installation of what used to be a much beloved series, this is exactly what you are getting here. I cannot recommend it highly enough.",Recommended
"So nostalgic and entertaining. I sometimes just stand and listen to the bgm and admire the scenery. \nIt just screams Castlevania. From the looks and music to the enemies and plot twists. \nMiriam and the other npc's looks alittle ""floaty"", when they run. It is possible to do some cheesing at the later bosses, but it kinda feels good :P Good job to everyone who made(and donated to) Bloodstained. Cannot wait to play it again and again ^^",Recommended
Must buy for SotN lovers,Recommended

Classic Castlevania! Reminds me of simon's quest!,Recommended
"Like many, I was skeptical that Igarashi's latest game would be able to live up to his past work on the Castlevania series but to my surprise it's easily one of his better games. I can't wait to see how the team is able to expand upon the game in the future.",Recommended

Classic Good Castlevania,Recommended
pretty good,Recommended
"Dear Ko**mi,\n\nThis is why you don't burn bridges with excellent devs : they will make a hugely successful crowd-funded game, publish it elsewhere, release it to gamers starving for an original Castlevania experience,  get overwhelmingly positive reviews 2 weeks after release...\n\nand you won't see a dime of it. \n\nSweet, sweet revenge.\n\nThanks again for doing it tho and enjoy that limited income from pachinko machines only available in one country.\n\nLots of lulz\nGamers on all platforms",Recommended

Upgrade or crafting mat? I must know!""  If you enjoyed filling your bestiary, finding all the drops, getting all the skills, learning all the techniques, and other versions of 100% clears then this entry will have that in spades. Every time I turn around there's more to discover, it's almost too tiring to even consider doing everything. \n\nAll of the prior 'exploits' such as dash cancel and jump cancel seem to work just fine and it makes the combat very fluid and responsive. \n\nA no brainer for any who enjoy Metroidvanias.",Recommended

An extremely fun and addictive game. Can't wait for the upcoming FREE DLC's this game has to offer.,Recommended
"I have been playing this game for a few days now, and i simply can't put it down. it's an amazing callback to the classic style of metroidvania. I can not reccomend this game enough if you're a fan of the genre or a fan of symphony of the night.",Recommended
Summer Sale Task,Recommended
I backed this. I don't regret it,Recommended
"Never played any Castlevania but can see why people love the series.\nHad to grind every enemy for their shards because I really had to know what they all were, despite a decent amount of them being very similar.\nAnd then same for the item drops because question marks can be anything! Even more question marks!\n\nNo good meme quotes (terrible night for a curse) and whatnot, sadly.\n\nHad a couple graphical glitches and crashes but nothing major considering I save 5 times every 3 minutes out of classic RPG save OCD.\nOnly downside is that you can't start on the harder difficulties without using a cheat code (found out after I beat the game).\n\nSome people have expressed disinterest over very little hints for locating key progress items, but I kinda like it. Was nice to beat my head against a wall to find the one single thing I need when every other game in the past decade has held my hand the way through. Really reminded me how games used to be: 'figure it out or look it up cause we ain't tellin' ya.'",Recommended
"All I really wanted was the chance to play GBA Castlevania games again, and boy does Bloodstained deliver. This was definitely worth waiting for.",Recommended
"Great game.\nAt the time of this review, the game is already a great metroidvania, in a lot of aspects a mix of multiple Castlevanias, mostly Symphony of the Night (on it's scale and progression), Aria of Sorrow (the entire shard system and build potential), and Order of Ecclesia (story and character design similarities). Feels great to finally play a new game in the series.\nIt suffers a little from technical issues, but mostly small nuisances from time to time.\nAlso has a lot of potential if all the DLCs (the kickstarter stretch goals) come out and deliver the same level of quality content as the base campaign.\nI'm already satisfied with the game as is, and am hopeful for it to get even better with future updates.\nHighly recommended, even at full price.",Recommended
SOLID,Recommended
Amazing especially if you loved SOTN,Recommended
"This is truly the spiritual successor to Symphony of the Night.  Some of the ideas from the DS Castlevania games also made it into this game.  This game was very enjoyable from start to finish.  There are some minor glitches throughout, such as enemy drops that can't be picked up, but nothing was game breaking.  If you were a fan of the side scrolling Castlevania games, you'll likely enjoy this game enough to justify the purchase.  If you never got into the Castlevania games, this might not be up your alley.",Recommended
A fanservice-filled trip for anyone nostalgic about Castlevania between Symphony of the Night and Order of Ecclesia.,Recommended
This game is quite good. It's about on par with the quality of the older Castlevania games the creator and his team are famous for.,Recommended
"Well it's good. Not what i expected by far. Definitely not a ""castlevania"" and far from be as good as hollow knight. But, good.",Recommended
"A nice throwback game and the graphics are charming... not 8 bit charming (not blocky and colorful) the ""2.5d"" effects work really well. my only gripe is bosses seem to be kindof forgettable BUT there are some really neat ones too",Recommended
"If you liked Symphony of the Night, you'll like this.  I love this style of game.",Recommended
"THIS is a spiritual succesor. I love it!!\n\nIt made me remember games such as Castlevania SOTN and Aria of Sorrow. It really knows how to take the different mechanics from those games and implementing its own mechanics. Appart from some minor bugs (which didn't break my game, thankfully) I loved every part of Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night, I can't wait for the DLCs to come!!\n\nKoji Igarashi delivered!!\n\nPS: Absolutely loved the little easter eggs making allusion to old Castlevania games (and some indie games as well!)",Recommended
A Very refreshing throwback.,Recommended
Simply Excellent.,Recommended

Satisfy the Castlevania itch.,Recommended
"Very similar to SotN. If you liked that, you will like this. \n\nMy only complaint is the crafting and the quests. The two vendors are not on the same screen and there is lots of back and forth making it a tedious process. The quests were silly... Talk to this npc and go kill x monsters. The quests felt tacked on, didn't need to be there, and just provided more back tracking to the little town hub for minimal reward.",Recommended
"If you're a fan of Castlevania SOTN, you'll probably gonna like this one.",Recommended
"Excellent Metroidvania with intriguing characters and plenty to do.\n\nPros: Ton of spells and interesting shard system for leveling them up, large map to explore, progression isn't grindy\n\nCons: I originally started with keyboard+mouse, and the UI didn't feel intuitive to use (There is no cursor and moving the mouse scrolls the options instead).  Switching to a controller improved the experience a lot.  Killing a monster next to a wall can make it so you can't pick up the loot they drop, which can be frustrating.",Recommended
"Incredible game, full of secrets and just a joy to explore. please make more!",Recommended
"I would highly recommend this game as it is now and with plenty of free DLC on the way this is a must play game if you love metroidvania games (and Jojo references). I would recommend New Game + only for those trying to 100 percent the game and easily get the no damage medals for all the bosses because, otherwise if you played the game like I did you'll end up one shotting everything on the higher difficulties. Instead, if you want a challenge, do the higher difficulties on a new save. Overall I would highly recommend this game, you just can't go wrong with a Igarashi game.",Recommended
s'good,Recommended
"I spent a lot of time not playing metroid/vania's because SOTN was the top of that mountain. This while maybe not better in my memory is phenomenal and close to that summit. It's sharp, looks good, feels good and plays right.",Recommended
I love this game. Ever bit of expectation i was feeling towards it was well well rewarded. Definitely the Spiritual successor of SOTN.,Recommended
"ArtPlay did a fine job. Bloodstained ROTN is a Recommended ""Igavania"" which respects its legacy. Recommended!",Recommended
"Disclosure: I am a Kickstarter backer for Bloodstained. I backed at the $125 level and received a free code for backing as well as other goodies. If it's considered receiving the product for free is debatable, but I'm disclosing it anyway.\n\nI'm a big fan of Castlevania Symphony of the Night and all 6 of the GBA/DS Castlevania games. Castlevania Symphony of the Night has been my favorite video game (out of all of the games that I've ever played) since 1998. Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night may just replace Symphony of the Night as my favorite game. It has a lot of what's best about Symphony of the Night combined with the improvements from Aria of Sorrow.\n\nThis is your basic Metroidvania type game with RPG elements such as leveling, stat growth, weapons, armor, accessories, etc. I really enjoy exploring the castle. I haven't finished the game yet as of this review.\n\nBe warned, as of June 29, 2019 there are still a fair amount of bugs and crashing in the game. I recommend saving often.",Recommended
"Disclaimer: It says I clocked in 63 hours  into this game, but that does not reflect how much time I actually played it. I have a bad habit of leaving windows opened.\n\nAt the risk of sounding like a broken record, this game truly brought me back to the days of playing Symphony of the Night and Aria of Sorrow for the first time. Rather than going on about the *almost* everything that I loved, let me tell you about the one glaring thing I really disliked:\n\nThe only thing I didn't like about Bloodstained is how you're forced to play the game on Easy Mode, and don't unlock Hard or Nightmare mode legitimately until after completion. Easy mode is, in my experience, far too easy to enjoy the game to its fullest. Luckily there is a cheat code you can enter to unlock Hard and Nightmare modes from the start, but I didn't figure that out until I already plowed through more than 8 hours on Easy. I promptly abandoned that save, started a new game on Hard, and enjoyed myself much more. I suggest you avoid my mistake and just go straight to Hard, if you're looking for more of a challenge. That being said, it's still probably a good idea to not do too much grinding. It's very easy to accidentally become over-powered, even on higher difficulties.",Recommended
"This game is awesome. the gameplay, graphics the different ways you can customize your character. still haven't finished the game yet, but I am aiming for 100% complete",Recommended
Highly recommend!,Recommended
Nice,Recommended
"I backed this game in 2015, and have been waiting patiently until this summer for it to finish development.\nAnd it's great.  Honestly.  It has enough of the right kind of throwbacks to SOTN to make me laugh and to push the nostalgia buttons, while still being a modern take on the classic genre.  I cannot recommend this game enough, if you like Metroidvania style games, or ever enjoyed Symphony of the Night.",Recommended
It's a great game.  :),Recommended
"-KICKSTARTER BACKER-\n\nCastlevania: Renaissance Of IGAvania\n\nKoji Igarashi is the de facto father of the Metroidvania genre due in part to games like Symphony Of The Night and Aria of Sorrow among his many other games. Without him it's hard to see the rise of the games that took the mantle and ensured the genre's survival like Guacamelee and Hollow Knight among many others. But five years have passed since his departure from Konami and, like Dracula, IGA has risen once again to cover the land in darkness and Kickstarter promises. Will he be slain or will the lord and master of the genre once again regain his throne to chuck wine glasses? Along for the ride are Michiru Yamane, the composer of Symphony of the Night, and Jake Kaufman, the composer of Shovel Knight. Bringing up the year is a twenty+ year history of Castlevania games that will the judge of Bloodstained.\n\nIn all ways but literal, Bloodstained is the Castlevania game we have been waiting for ever since Portrait of Ruin. The gameplay is tight and focused, enemies now react properly to being hit where they didn't in the earlier demo, the graphics have been polished and with the exception of the odd bug or two, this is the game IGA needed to put out. Following on the heels of the IntiCreates 2D Bloodstained which pays homage to Castlevania 1-4 in their linear levels and straight pathways, Ritual of the Moon is the send up and send off to Symphony and the others that took Exploration and RPG concepts over straight level running. As per the norm of this genre Miriam, the main character, must traverse Gebel's demonic hell castle. The castle is separated into different zones from obvious Japanese setting to spooky science lab to molten cave and more. In her travels Miriam, a Shardbinder, gets access to shards that function the same as Souls did in Aria of Sorrow. By defeating monsters you gain access to their powers whether it's double jumping, going super speed or being able to swim, Miriam can upgrade her abilities both throw a crafting system and through just getting more of that soul. Both level (Rank) and number of (Grade) affect the power of the shards.\n\nMiriam can also make food which, when first eaten, grants PERMANENT stat boosts. Drink some apple juice? That's another 1 magic per second recharge you got. Miriam also wields a number of weapons from the classic Caslevania whip (warning it doesn't control the same), to a gun to a renamed Crissaegrim. Each of these weapons and groups have their own special techniques and movesets but when in doubt I just used the great sword. My only complaint of Ritual Of The Night, and this one hurts me more than it hurts the game, is the soundtrack. There's nothing wrong with it but it doesn't have the same kinda bangers that Symphony Of The Night did. There's nothing matching Dance of Gold or Tragic Prince or Lost Painting, and that's a real shame because EVERYTHING else in this game is the epitome of the genre and I would be happy putting this in my top 3 castlevanias right with Symphony and Aria.\n\nIf you liked ANY of the IGA made Castlevanias or enjoy Metroidvanias in any way shape or form you owe it to yourself to add this to your collection and remind yourself why IGA is the dark prince of the genre. He can throw my wine glasses any day. If this is a preview that ex-Konami people can put out solid gold hits when their hands aren't tied by bullshit management then we should be terrified of Death Stranding. This review didn't even get to the fact that the game has an active discord server ( k88YasP ), and the crew working on this are actively listening and are at this very moment working on making the Switch version better.\n\n5/5 One of the absolute best of the genre and a reminder that old dogs can not only be taught new tricks, but are masters of old ones.",Recommended
great game had alot of fun :) stays Recommended to castlevania,Recommended

An excellent spiritual successor to the excellent Castlevania series (specifically Symphony of the Night) that does not only copy but improves upon many aspects of the Castlevania games whilst also bringing in many new features to allow it to stand apart from its spiritual predecessors.,Recommended
"A little rough around the edges in terms of polish but the great Castlevania style is alive and well. I would say the game borrows more from Dawn of Sorrow than Symphony of the night (actually have never played that one!). \n\nDefinitely fun to explore, level up, and get new shard powers which come a lot easier than in previous games.\n\nI hope to see a sequel and I want to get back to playing this game!",Recommended
If you loved Symphony of the Night then this is everything you've been waiting for ever since. You have to play this!,Recommended
It is like a more polished Symphony of the Night with a lot of elements of later metroidvania Castlevnias and also new gameplay elements. It is great.,Recommended
Excellent metroidvania games with tons of easter eggs and carries the feel of Castlevania games of old.,Recommended
"Es un magnifico juego en toda la extensión, un metroidvania moderno que incluye todas las buenas características de los clásicos agregando a su vez algunos elementos modernos. Si eres un viejo fan de los metroidvania es una compra sin pensar, y si no eres tan conocedor de este género es un buen juego para comenzar, me tomo aproximadamente 13 hrs en terminar al 100% el mapa y algunos secretos en modo normal, ampliamente recomendado!!!",Recommended
"Great IGAvania. Too short for my taste, tho, and I really miss SotN-esque OST, few tracks are truly memorable in this game.",Recommended
"48 hours later (Normal + Hard beat and all achievements completed + all items collected), I'm happily surprised at how fun it has been. Looking forward to the DLCs we've been promised so I can sink even more time into the game.\n\n8/10 as it stands.",Recommended
Game is absolutely fantastic. Brings me back to Symphony of the Night on the PSX.,Recommended

Loving this game. There have been a few minor glitches but nothing that hasn't fixed itself or that has taken away from my experience.

"IGA set out to make the Castlevania game that Konami wouldn't let him make, and damn did he do it. It's every bit what I'd hoped it would be when I backed it and more, with all the flavor I've come to love from the series Bloodstained isn't really a part of.

"This game is like a wet dream for those who loved Symphony of the Night, in all forms except music, which is still very very good, but the music here you can't get stuck in your head as much as something like Waltz of Pearls from Symphony of the Night.

Then:\n#1 Give it many more weapons, armor and accessories\n#2 Give it an alchemy/crafting/cooking/fashion system\n#3 replace the old 8 or so spells with a system where you basically learn abilities after they've been used against you.\n\nIt's good, maybe a little grindy though.",Recommended

It's good.,Recommended
"As someone new to Castlevania-like games, I loved this one. There is so much variety and so much to do that my playthrough lasted a solid 24ish hours. I wasn't disappointed, and now I'm almost enticed to try some actual Castlevania titles.\n\nBoss fights are incredibly fun.\nWeapon variety is great.\nCrafting system is a little weird, but was fun to tinker with. My only complaint is it's a little TOO grindy at times IMO.\nEnvironmental design is great, as are enemies. Music too.\nGraphics suffer in a few areas, mostly stuff like hair physics etc. But that's my only big complaint there.\nI wish there were more customization options for appearance, but what's provided is still adequate.\n\nOverall, amazing game. Not very many bad aspects to it, and it has a massive amount of replayability (not even factoring in DLC).",Recommended
"This is the labor of love that I had hoped this would be, with this decked out Metroidvania with quests, interesting weapons and abilities there is no reason that you shouldn't buy this game for yourself and make yourself feel good.",Recommended

"My love for SotN had me kickstart this game, and I'm happy with the result.",Recommended
"Pretty good so far, at least miles better than certain other kickstarted game with a noodle limb robot boy. A few glitches here and there but nothing game-breaking. Pretty much a combination of Symphony of the Night and Aria of Sorrow, so if you liked those metroidvanias you'll probably like this one.",Recommended
"IGA Did deliver, if you played all GBA, DS and SotN Castlevanias you will feel right at home. As of the moment not all planned DLC are in. But game in quite enjoyable state. RPG Metroidvenia, in my opinion best kind of motroidvenia that can be. The game itself is around 10 hours for good ending, it took me 30 cos i wanted everything 100%. Replay ability is not quite there yet. After you 100% first run, New Game+ looks very unrewarding. Avoid playing first time on Normal (get a password to start right away on Hard or Nightmare). I finished on both Normal and Hard and Hard stops being a bit hard right after first segment of the game (Ship). Plus if you get the *medusa head* familiar there right away its be even easier. Sure the game have some elements i would change, but overall its an upgrade from SotN and DS Order of Ecclesia features and systems. The welcoming feature for me was the passive shard ability and after upgrading it with alchemy to the max it becomes a skill shard (meaning you can max all of them and be overpowered).\n\nI bough it and DLC just to show support for IGA and let him know we need more of such games.\nCmon Konami, step out of the sh!t you buried yourself in and make a good Castlevania, IGA himself even said in interview if Konami asked to make one, he would agree.",Recommended
definitely a winner. i've played plenty of Metroidvania games and this one is one of my favourite :),Recommended
"Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night really is a Recommended spiritual successor to Castlevania: Symphony of the Night, everything from core gameplay, map design, game mechanics (with the exception of a few new mechanics introduced in this), character design, and even soundtrack will remind you of Castlevania, if you enjoyed symphony of the night then is a must, from a prespective of those who never experienced that but enjoy exploration RPG's then you should certainly give this game a try.",Recommended
"Simply said, if you liked Symphony of the Night, this is the game for you. However, this is not just a recreation of old Castlevania, it still feels fresh and new. Gameplay is fluid, progress is not too hard, though sometimes not at all logical. I have yet to beat the game (legit, though I managed to get the game over ending), but the difficulty curve does not seem overwhelming at all. I think the closest comparison I can make is Dust: An Elyssian Tale,.\n\nTo sum it up, the game is seriously pushing my nostalgia buttons, so I might enjoy more than I should, but regardless, I think it is a great game.",Recommended
I LOVE TO BE THE CASTLEVANIA,Recommended
Game is great if your a castlevania fan this is a must play. No flaws no glitches game runs at a smooth 60fps its perfect love it worth the wait 👍👍👍👍,Recommended

"As someone who almost never played a metroidvania style game, this is a fun an engaging game for players on all skill levels. \n\nEvery shard you get feels fun and exciting, and see how they worked in different weapons with different abilities is absolutely fun to discover.\n\nI am bad at reviews, but basically I suck and disliked metroidvania genre until this game.",Recommended

"To start off, Castlevania: Symphony of the Night has been one of my top 3 favorite games of all time, but I haven't played a Castlevania afterwards. I have played multiple Metroidvania on PC since then though. I have put many hours in to the game, and I have to say, I am enjoying it about as much as SOTN. In fact it seems to be SOTN but on steroids. You have a mountain of content with collecting all the equipment, the quests, hidden rooms, hidden bosses, and all the different shards to farm that every monster drops. Cooking, crafting, farming, this game has it all.\n\nIs the game perfect? No. Either you love the graphics or you don't. I didn't like it from the videos, but playing in person felt much better. I prefer SOTN 2D graphics, but that era is gone. Plus they have a few cool things with the 3D. There are some QOL and design choices that I question, but honestly it is pretty much all very minor.\n\nHighly recommend to any Metroidvania fan.",Recommended

If you like Castlevania SOTN and want that and more. Play this game.,Recommended
"I loved the game, but hated the price.  Just under 20 hours let me see all the content except one optional boss that i dont feel like back tracking for.  Sure people will tell you that there is still a ton of achivements for me to unlock, but most of them are silly grinds with no sense of satisfaction for completing.",Recommended
"A proper metrodivania and a spiritual successor to the Castlevania series, what else do you need.",Recommended
Hey! Do you like the old Iga Castlevania games? Looking for a solid spiritual successor? Ever wonder what Castlevania Order of Ecclesia would be like if it was given an actual budget? Well look no further! Bloodstained is a solid RPG with some fun bosses and mechanics. And you get to kick a dragon to death if you so choose so ya know solid game 10/10,Recommended
"It's a Recommended IGAvania. I wouldn't say it brings anything new to the table, but it does bring ALL the old stuff.",Recommended
This game is good.,Recommended
"So, if you like castlevania games you should buy this. Cheese bosses, grind out cooking  ingredients, make swords, make yourself pretty. Do it. It's fun. Or don't. I'm not your dad.",Recommended
"This is a great game. It IS Castlevania. A mix here and there from OoE, DoS and SotN. If you loved those games, you'll love this game.",Recommended
Gameplay is really close to Castlevania: Dawn/Aria of Sorrow. 10/10,Recommended
"If you are a fan of Metroidvanias, this spiritual successor to Symphony of the Night is the perfect game for you",Recommended
"If you liked SotN, you will like this game.",Recommended
Fantastic! Old-style but still very modern.,Recommended
"My first Igavania, but it won't be my last one.",Recommended
"If you add pretty graphics and some memes to Symphony of the Night, you get this.",Recommended
Absolutely wonderful call back to Castlevania Symphony of the Night. Do yourself a favor and play this if you enjoy metroidvanias.,Recommended
"If you enjoyed Symphony of the Night and all its various hand-held sequels then this is exactly what you are looking for, no need to read any further.\n\nIf you aren't  familiar with the 2d Castlevania games then it's basically a non-linear platforming action adventure set in a sprawling monster filled castle, with added RPG style levelling, crafting, skill upgrading and about a million different weapons/armour/magic powers to collect. Not that you even need to worry about any of that stuff, if you just want to run around hitting monsters with whatever swords you find along the way then that'll work just fine. \n\nYou might get stuck with progression here and there, I had to look a couple of things up online, but its so lovely that I can forgive it.",Recommended
This is a very fun metriodvainia game.,Recommended
Awesome and beautiful! Brought back many memories of Castlevania. Someone needs to remake Castlevania!,Recommended
This game is everything i wanted and more. The people behind this game did amazing with recreating the feeling of Castelvania games and i love the art. There are a few bugs which i have seen but not much so far. The biggest issue i have had so far is my screen will be flashing green when i start the game and that is annoying but i think that is more me than anything.\n\nGreat job with the game guys it's been a long wait but well worth it.,Recommended
Great game realy enjoyingit,Recommended
"It's just Castlevania Aria of Sorrow but new and shiny, exactly what I wanted.",Recommended
Gr8 game,Recommended
"The game is okay, I wouldn't recommend buying this game at its current price. 50% off or more would make it more worth the money. 2.5D is awful. if u like metroidvania's I'm sure you'll finish it at least. If you're full weeb I'm sure you'll love it",Recommended
"Castlevania but with a different name, completely worth your money.",Recommended
" The Castlevania name may be wasting away, tethered to Konami, but the game lives on without them. Bloodstaind Ritual of the Night IS Castlevania or ""Metroidvania"" if you prefer it. Igarashi has improved on the formula with new mechanics and a deeper crafting system. This is a game modern Konami would be incapable of producing. Well done!",Recommended
Very good game,Recommended
SotN clone that pushes above and beyond.  Masterful.,Recommended
"A lot of people will tell you that this game takes all of the best parts of Symphony of the Night, Aria of Sorrow, Order of Ecclesia, etc and puts those parts into one game to make a masterpiece. But I argue that by taking all of the best parts of other nearly legendary games and failing to add you own, you create a game with an odd mash of features that lacks its own character.\n\nBy no means is Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night a bad game. It just does not do anything to set itself apart from the Castlevania staples it draws so much influence from. And as a result, it misses the chance to have it's own defined character like the others do.",Recommended
"I loved Dawn of Sorrow on the Nintendo DS and this is just like it, the story isn't quite as fleshed out as I would've liked but it's just what you'd want from a Metroidvania",Recommended
"A return to perfect metroidvania form from the man who made it what it is.\n\nCastlevania is dead, and Konami killed it, but from the ashes, Koji Igarashi revives it in the form of Bloodstained.\n\nKoji has worked on the Castlevania franchise in the past as a producer, so when it comes to understanding the formulae of what it should be, he knows his shit. The graphics, music, and most importantly, gameplay, all feel incredibly familiar, a Recommended successor to Castevania. THIS IS IT.",Recommended
An excellent game that any Metroidvania fan will enjoy. Definitely worth your time.,Recommended
"A fantastic addition to the metroidvania genre, a little short, but otherwise a lot of fun",Recommended

"An excellent videogame and exactly what people have been craving since Order of Ecclesia. I could go into everything I feel this game does right, but I'm sure those have been handled by other reviews just fine. Instead I'm going to cover possible missteps that honestly don't ruin the experience, but can be frustrating to the average player who's on his first rodeo with this type of game, or just aggravating in general. Keep in mind that I hold a very high opinion of this game and consider it to be one of the best games I've played all year, but no game is perfect. Hopefully my review is seen by someone who can address these issues and possibly lead into that ""perfect game"" we all want so much.\n\n1. The crashes. This is rare, but I'm sure others will agree that they've seen a FATAL ERROR at one point or another, especially involving bookcases. I've gotten it once in my play time, but any fatal error is an issue on the developer's end and should eventually be addressed. It's not even a specific bookcase, and it doesn't always happen. I got a Fatal Error on a bookcase in the Underground Waterway, reloaded the game, immediately went back the same way and interacted with it again, and it worked fine. I'm unsure how to reproduce that issue, but it still needs to be addressed. Even if you saved recently, having your game crash because you did something you were intended to do is frustrating.\n\n2. The progression is absolutely ruined at 2 key points in the game's storyline. No, I'm not referring to the train. I feel there's enough information given to you on that front that it really shouldn't be an issue. People say having to speak to Dominique twice to get the hint is a stretch, but I learned 2 things early in that allowed me to avoid that problem. One, that Dominique does, in fact, give hints about where to go next. Next, through speaking with Johannes early on that a character can have many lines to give you, even back to back without having to leave the room. When Dominique didn't give me the hint after talking with her the first time, I simply spoke to her again.\n\nThe points in the game that I feel should be addressed are definitely swimming and the Aegis Armor. Unlocking swimming forces you to farm an enemy with a 10% shard drop, meaning even if you took the quest from Lindsey to kill some of them, there's a chance you still won't get the shard needed for critical access to the next area. This is easily solved by simply forcing one of those enemies to have a one-time 100% shard drop rate, like the tutorial enemy at the start of the boat, or the enemy that drops Flame Cannon on the boat that allows you to light the cannon to progress. It's a simple fix that was used earlier in the game, so I don't see why it wasn't used here.\n\nAs for the Aegis Armor, there is absolutely no hint at all that this armor even exists. When I first came across the spikes you need the Aegis Armor for, my first thought was that I was going to somehow unlock a bat transformation or something to fly in-between the spikes. How to fix this point is a bit tricky, however. I thought about having the chest always appear on the map, but that would be inconsistent with all other chests in the game. Instead my idea would be to simply change the camera in one of the top rooms near where the chest is. Have it zoom out and reveal the chest's location in that one specific room. It would be fairly obvious that that chest is important, but again, something similar to this was used earlier in the game. Specifically, the red moon that you passed by near the beginning of the game. That room stands out because of how out-of-place the moon looks, and the fact that it's in front of the background parts of the castle, instead of being far in the sky. A very obvious hint at what's to come later. It isn't a perfect solution, but it's the best I've got right now.\n\n3. My last gripe is the fact that there is, seemingly, no way to make Dominique repeat a hint. If there is, please correct me, but once she gives a hint, you can not have her repeat it.  This is annoying solely because I did some shopping right when I was done playing the game, and she gave a hint. When I returned to the game I had forgotten what, exactly, she said and had no obvious way to make her repeat it. I ended up wandering around until I stumbled into the next required area. This is easily fixed by simply adding a fourth option to her menu that makes her repeat her last hint. Not everyone has a perfect memory and will recall it vividly after taking a break from the game, unfortunately.\n\nWell that about covers everything I found outwardly wrong with the game. Since my major complaints include things that I admit are gripes, minor annoyances, and some meager frustrations, it should be clear that this is a very well made game that could simply be better. With patches and more content coming later, I sincerely hope it does get better and better with time.",Recommended
"If you ever played and liked any Igavania game, then this is the game for you.",Recommended
"If you loved Castlevania: Symphony of the Night, you'll love this game.",Recommended
"4 years ago I backed this game and I don't regret doing so. This is a Igavania thoroughbred. I have some problems with sound though. It keeps distorting, when too many sounds are played at the same time. The OST is compentent, but no amazing track was produced. The one area where i would liked to have seen improvement is combat. Every weapon has 1 technique you can use on this weapon. There are diffrent techniques for the weapon types though. I.e. a parry, consecutive slashes, projectiles etc. Why can't you use all techniques of a weapon type on every weapon of the type? This leaves only the normal strike as the attack you use the most. There is a lot of variety in magic, which helps offset the monotony of combat. Graphics are alright, especially ligthing has improved from the backer demo. I took around 15h to finish it. There is a lot of replay value with the upcoming characters and modes, which is nice.\nThey only have to fix the switch port now and this Kickstarter Game will be a full success story.",Recommended

"This game is an awesome spiritual successor to the IgaVania Castlevania series. I haven't loved a game this much in years! \n\nI've put 40+ hours into it in the last 2 weeks, 100%'d normal, almost done with a NG+ run through.\n\nThe game is well executed on many levels:\n- Movement is tight and responsive, extremely similar to SotN\n- Graphics are great (I'm playing on a 43in 4k screen with a RTX 2070)\n- Story is interesting, would be cool to explore more of the world in future games\n- Magic / Weapon Combat system is interesting and vast. \n- Easter eggs and hidden rooms/items galore! \n- interesting cosmetic customization option. It should definitely have more options though, or at least the option to hide your armor or change how it looks once you can craft it. \n- Replayability is definitely there! \n\nSome things that aren't perfect:\n- Accepting multiple quests from the quest giver is kinda tedious, but it's literally like 1minute of the entire game.\n- The shop is crazy expensive, and the dismantling mechanism for breaking down items is definitely in need of a cost reduction. \n- The 99 per item limit feels like lazy programming, as well as the limits on potions. To craft gold you need 50 of something, so you can literally only craft 1 bar at a time and then you have to run over to the shop to buy 1 more tiny item to craft a 2nd bar - that's just tedious.\n- There are a few times where game progress is dependent on acquiring items that are hidden or are random drops by a single creature - there should definitely be some sort of hint added to help future players not have to google how to progress.\n\nAll in all I will definitely be looking for more of these in the future, as well as looking for the future DLC! \n\nFANTASTIC JOB!",Recommended
LOVE THIS GAME ITS GREAT\n,Recommended
Igarashi has captured the original feel the metroidvania style of game he helped popularize with the classic Symphony of the Night.\nGood game/10,Recommended
"Solid spiritual successor to the Castlevania series, highly recommend.",Recommended
"It took me a few minutes to get used to the (not very but still noticable) generic feeling of the game engine, but as soon as I got past that, I was drowned in a deep feeling of nostalgia both by the music and gameplay.\n\nAs a person that has fully completed Castlevania: SotN a double digit amount of times sporadically from the age of 7 or so up until the present day, I can say with all of my heart that I love this game, much more than I thought I would!\n\nI wish I could hit the recommend button more than once!\n\nAlso note that there are a few minor bugs in the game like some passives messing up in certain situations et cetera, it's not perfect, these are bugs I'm confident will get fixed very soon.",Recommended
"There are a few things that feel really odd, not really connectable steps. Such as receiving the train pass. Also having to keep killing the same enemies for shards is sort of painful. However its a very complete package and worth your time if you enjoy Castlevania symphony of the night and Aria of Sorrow.",Recommended
Despite the final boss audio killing my ears and not feeling the cutscene due to said audio bug\nand the 2nd to the final boss bugging into the walls..\n\n10/10 would recommend.\n\nGameplay gets better as you progress.\nAwesome story.\nAwesome music.\nAwesome art.\n\n\n[i][b]!

"If you missed symphony of the night, this is a golden gem to fill that metroidvania itch. Game is really solid with a good variety of weapons and shards to make for everyone to have a slightly different experience. My only real complaint was that there was a few times that I felt that progression wasn't clear (to be fair I wasn't reading every journal entry I found).",Recommended
"this game is just beautiful, and fun plain and simple. There where some points in the game that had me go 'how the hell was i suppose to know that"" but it could've been my mistake, i love the variety  of weapons and skills too, this definitely gives the game a real replay-ability factor.",Recommended
Excellent game.,Recommended
It's like them Castlevania games and it's a good one.,Recommended
"I've been looking forward to this game for years, and honestly I can say it's been worth the wait!\n\nIt's very reminiscent of Aria of Sorrow, more than other Castlevania games. If you liked the gameplay in that one, you'll like this game.\n\nMonster design is top notch, and boss fights are pretty fun.\n\nAlso, who can say no to David Hayter being in the game?",Recommended
"It's a classic-style adventure platformer, delivered as if it was just a couple years after Iga made his last DS Castlevania- this is straight up Symphony of the Night filtered through Aria of Sorrow, and if you know what that means and are excited, it's absolutely worth your time.  Lots of items, lots of weapons, lots of powers, a large castle to explore and secrets to find.  There's a lot of ways to approach playing the game, from slow and deliberate and filling out your arsenal and stats with equipment and alchemy, or just blitzing forward and mastering combat while making due with what you find on the way.  \n\nWhat this game isn't is a modern-era adventure platformer, and if your love for the genre comes from more modern takes on the genre like Hollow Knight or Steamworld Dig, then note that this a very old game at it's soul, and while the genre has moved on, Bloodstained hasn't.  It's enemy design is very basic and lacks variety in how you interact with them, it relies multiple times on subtle gotchas or finding this one obscure thing to progress instead of leaving the way forward to more organic exploration, and while the game's weapons are myriad, nothing is fleshed out much with variety in styles replacing variety in application of those styles.\n\nOverall, recommended.  Especially if what you're craving is an old-school loot 'n grind RPG adventure platformer, this will absolutely deliver.   That said, temper your expectations: Bloodstained is for good and for ill a throwback to the very specific era of the DS Castlevania games and it has encased itself as a time capsule of such while the games inspired by that legacy have moved forward in the eleven years since we last got one of these.",Recommended
Great game! Especially if you like Castlevania.,Recommended
"It's an amazing game, while being a giant middle finger to Konami",Recommended
Top notch metroid-vania action. \n\nPlays like a perfected version of the excellent DS Castlevania games.\n\nHighly Recommend!,Recommended

"Spiritual successor to Castlevania: Symphony of the Night. If you were a fan of that game you should have fun with this game as well. Tons of weapons, spells and abilities so you can choose how to play your character just the way you want to. A bit expensive for a single playthrough but great value for achievement hunters and those wanting to do a second playthrough on the harder difficulties.\n\nGood fun exploration and action where the game does not handheld you on where to go or what to do next really rewarding those that take time to explore and experiment.",Recommended
Nostalgia! <3,Recommended
"An excellent castlevania, but feels held back by the grindiness of some of the game's side quests. A large variety of weapons and skills to use mean you can constantly switch up your tactics, but some items are locked behind extremely low drop rates (as low as 1%) with enemies that might only appear once or twice, so it feels like you really have to go out of your way to unlock specific weapons, ingredients, or skills. This also makes certain skills more viable, as you upgrade skills partly through alchemy and partly through finding duplicate versions of the skill, resulting in very common skills ending up being more powerful just because they're easier to upgrade. Besides that, there are plenty of hidden secrets, rewarding careful searching and multiple runthroughs.",Recommended
"Been a kickstarter of this game, the game itself is really nice, but I've yet to recieve my Digital Soundtrack code!\n\nVery SOTN, with some OoE thrown into it. Solid game, pick it up if you like the metroidvania style kind of games.",Recommended
"It's pretty much an amalgamation of Symphony of the Night, Order of Ecclesia, and Aria/Dawn of Sorrow -- if you enjoyed those Castlevania entries, then you'll probably love this game.",Recommended

A spiritual successor to the castlevania series. It's a mix between SotN and Dawn of sorrow. A perfect game for thoose who like grinding and metroidvanias.,Recommended
Yes,Recommended
"If you like the old IGAvanias, you'll love Bloodstained.",Recommended

"Every once in a while, a game comes along that redefines a genre.\n\nIn the case of ""metroidvanias"", that game has finally arrived. \n\nIt's name: Hollow Knight.\n\nHowever, if you want a mediocre metroidvania game that relies heavily on nostalgia to get a pass, you can give Bloodstained a go.",Not Recommended
Pretty good,Recommended
Honestly an amazing game. Would recommend to a friend. Good job developers on this one!,Recommended
"This game has a lot going for it.  It is Castlevania: Symphony of the Night's spiritual successor I would say.  It has everything you love in SOTN and many new additions.  Plus a huge metroid-vania map to explore.\n\nOnly downsides is that I have seen multiple crashes.  They have been far and few in between but still exist.\n1. One of them has happened about 3 times when opening bookshelves.  The book animation completes, then there is a soft crash causing you to restart the game.\n2. The other one that I have seen is when playing for a long time without exiting the game (maybe 1.5 to 2 hours).  Then the game hard locked where I still heard the music playing, but nothing could be done to end task the game.  So I had to just reboot my PC.\n\nBut beyond the minor bugs (minor since they are not game/save breaking), this game gets better and better as you play.\n\nThe price point is a bit steep, but I would say that it qualifies as a fully fleshed out game being worth a new $60 game.",Recommended
"While the art may be off at times overall this is a fine follow up to those adventures of that family of vampire slayers we had growing up with, and that is without all the planned dlc released even.",Recommended
"An amazing spiritual successor to SOTN. If you enjoyed any metroid-vania style game, you'll love this!",Recommended
"If you liked Castlevania's Symphony of the Night, Aria of Sorrow, and Dawn of Sorrow, you will like this game. Though before buying you should know the game does not hold your hand, and expects you to check every little thing, even down to your equipment descriptions. 10/10 game though, I've bought it twice once here and on the Switch with no issues besides  two random crashes in about 20 hours.",Recommended
Its SoTN but with better graphics.,Recommended

iz gud,Recommended
"This was a great little game that I wasn't expecting.\n\nIf you can get passed the art style, you'll find a platformer / explorer with a lot to offer in the way of solid mechanics and neat touches.\n\nNormal difficulty: Starts a bit challenging (there is no autosaves at all, only saves when you save in the save room, a nasty shock the first time that you die and have to restart from your last save, so save often)\n\nby mid-game you are hilariously enormously overpowered, killing whole rooms in one instant cast spell, or having your minions do that for you, with you only occasionally vaporizing the odd tough enemy.\n\nboss encounters are something you will have very little difficulty with.\n\nBy endgame the toughness of monsters picks up again but it never really offers a tough challenge.\n\nBut this is ok, this is the type of game that it is, its a 2D version of warframe, which is not asking ""how could I beat this encounter?"" it is instead asking ""how do you want to totally demolish this encounter?"" which is a different question and satisfies a diffrent need from, say a dark souls  for example.\n\nAgain, good old fashioned fun in a modern package.",Recommended
Fun Castlevania style game with lots of upgrades. I'm a sucker for getting new items/weapons/etc. and this game gives that in spades. One of the few games that I wanted to 100% complete.,Recommended
"Really good metroidvania from a big name in the genre. I kickstarted it in 2015 and despite the rocky development process and the number of delays, it was worth the wait. There was obviously a lot of care and attention put into making the game right. I'm looking forward to the additional DLC modes that will come in the future.",Recommended
"I've waited a long time for another Metroidvania, with plenty of games coming close but not satisfying. Despite my worries, Bloodstained has fulfilled that particular itch quite well. As someone who enjoys the power-building and exploration aspects of the game, I enjoyed turning myself into an overpowered force of nature perhaps a bit too much. My next run was leaner and on a higher difficulty and I found the challenge and patterns to be balanced, though that's an objective value.\n\nThere were three moments where I got lost and had trouble advancing. The first was simply overlooking the obvious. The second felt like sequence breaking and was cool, but might be hard for some players. The third, however, I had to look up. I'm not immensely pleased with the Aegis plate.\n\nOverall, aside from that one issue, I enjoyed the game a lot.",Recommended
"I don't have any strong distaste for this game, only the hysteria that I can only describe as a collective spite fueled delusion. \n\nThe game feels as it should (after turning on input lag reduction), and it goes through all of the motions of a Castlevania game, it just does everything in such an expected and unremarkable fashion. \n\nThe location / beastiary and the castle design is reminiscent of the bland (and sometimes nonsensical) of Dark Souls 2 and the game looks like it was crafted in bronzed playdoh, the lions share of bosses can be mowed down by attacking them relentlessly and there's a number of animation issues and bugs that drag the experience down even further.\n\nFor story, scenes go on for far too long, and the early game bombards you with lore, and dialog that lasts 4 - 6 sentences longer than it needs to. The lack of editing here is apparent and the whole affair is both uninspired and poorly executed. Does anyone care about Gebel and Miriam? We're told about their relationship and we're supposed to care, but we don't even get to see or interact with him at all before he turns. \n\nThe middling to bad voice direction doesn't help matters either, especially when Katana man and propped up badass Zangetsu enters a scene. As much as I love David Hayter, I feel that the direction here was lacking... and apparently ""Do like... Solid Snake but like... not him?"" It comes off as jarring and wholly unfitting for what the character is supposed to be. I'm also not entirely sure why the intro narration was done by someone who intermittently mumbles his lines.\n\nBut despite it all; the FIRE CAVE and ICE CAVE, the weird voice acting, the badly animated scenes, writing problems... There's some semblance of heart in this. Some reverence of the source material.\n\nNext time, I hope they do better.",Not Recommended

It was worth waiting so many years.. im a kickstarter backer but im still waiting for the promised stretch goals! the game is a good igavania i wish it was longer tbh and that the boss fights where harder but its pretty good!,Recommended

"Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night is a fantastic game pure and simple. Wrinting up a wonderful Metroidvania formula in the process the game goes about pressing the right buttons for me. Tight, responsive controls send you to gaming bliss from the get go and inspiring music acompany the game. Besides the top notch adventuring there are items to be crafted and quests to get back in your base.\n\nThe game features superb animations for just about every character in the game and there are lots of customisations you can make with Miriam, the game's protagonist. There's random drops from your enemies in the game that might result in souring the deal when you really want a specific sort of loot but other than that I don't have major issues with the game though I did encounter some slowdowns of the framerate yesterday\n\nTo sum it up: Good combat and exploration, complimented by wonderful music and an intriguing story with a cast of quirky characters, I wholeheartedly recommend this game. 'Tis a gem!",Recommended
It's ait,Recommended
"After much waiting, Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night is finally here. The last game that Iga, who gave us the Metroidvania subgenre, made in this mode was 2008's Castlevania: Order of Ecclesia. And Bloodstained could have been released in 2009; it's basically a direct sequel to Order of Ecclesia and the logical next step in the original Metroidvania franchise. Everything from setting, art and soundtrack, core gameplay, and kinda hokey story is there exactly as it was. Some of the weapons and items transfer all but directly from Symphony of the Night or Dawn of Sorrow. Time has not moved in the Igaverse.\n\nThis means that, if you have been hoping for a new Recommended SotN, you're in for a treat; this is the game I've been literally waiting a decade for. The style, the fun, the reference and humor (you can equip ""Toy Boots"" that squeak when you walk with them, and there is an enemy that is basically just Shovel Knight), are all there.\n\nOn the other, you might wonder if a game that could have been released a decade ago holds up now. After all, in Iga's absence, people took Metroidvania into their own hands. The emergence of roguelikes added further innovations and twists. Does this game hold up?\n\nYes. Yes it does. Because at the end of the day, Metroidvanias succeed or fail not mainly based on core concepts, which are straightforward (take some action-platformer, add exploration and ARPG progression, hit blend), but on quality of design--are the items and skills fun to use? Is the map interesting? Do secrets effectively reward exploration? Iga birthed a subgenre because he was really, really good at this. He still is, and his design principles still hold up. The pile of free DLCs that are planned will also account for some of the later innovations in the genre; the inclusion of a future Roguelike mode in particular is interesting. They will also help to justify the somewhat hefty (but not horrendous, as some seem to think) pricetag.\n\nThere are, at this point, a few bugs. There are one or two skills that don't display quite right on the character, for instance, and occasional hangups. But overall, the game runs very well as a initial release. Also, for anyone like me who has become used to playing their Metroidvanias Roguelike-style, the game might feel easier than you're used to--I'm the sort of person who scours the map everything before beating the game, and as has always been the case in Igavania, you can become an avatar of death if you put your mind to it. (Which is one of the great things about Iga's design--if you put in the effort, you can become a powerhouse, and you don't need 1K hours to do it.) But the game is well-balanced for an ordinary run.\n\nSo yes, it was worth the wait.\n\nReview: 9.8 miserable little piles of secrets/10",Recommended
"Absolutely fantastic game. Completely succeeds in capturing the feeling of Castlevania and is extremely fun to play even when you're lost or getting your ass kicked by a boss. Aside from a few audio bugs and glitches I encountered during my first playthrough the game runs well and the controls are very responsive. Soundtrack is great, fun boss battles, and you can even get a flaming whip and pretend that you're a Belmont. Don't miss out on this, a shining rare example of a crowd funded game living up to the hype.",Recommended
Good game!,Recommended
It's Castlevania Aria of Sorrow basically. It's amazing. Worth the money.,Recommended
"It's a good throwback to the classic Castlevania titles. Sometimes I feel there's just a bit *too* many items and shards in the game though, which makes for a lot of filler and no incentive to really use most of what's available, since by the time you obtain the shards or items, you've already crafted or bought something stronger.\n\nIt doesn't make the game bad, as you can easily play through it and have Symphony of the Night nostalgia waves, it just means you have to sort through a lot of garbage items to find the ones you really want.",Recommended
"Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night (RotN) is not, at its core, a metroidvania. Rather, ALL it is, is a metroidvania. Bloodstained is the most nostalgic game you'll play this year, that came out this year, but feels like it came out over a decade ago. None of these statements are meant to be criticisms (mostly). Bloodstained is 100% exactly what you signed up for.\n\nCreated by Koji Igarashi, thanks to Kickstarter support and developers like IntiCreates and Wayforward joining his cause, Bloodstained is the spiritual successor to the Castlevania franchise. Specifically, Bloodstained follows the ""Igavania"" style of Castlevania games. More specifically, Bloodstained is the amalgamation of Symphony of the Night, Aria of Sorrow, and a dash of Order of Ecclesia. If you've played or are at least familiar with those games, you'll know what you're getting with Bloodstained. You can stop reading here...\n\n[h1]Writing[/h1]\n\n...but if you kept reading, I appreciate it. Bloodstained is the story of Miriam, a shardbinder who has recently awaken from a 10 year coma. A shardbinder is a human who can take on the fallen shards of demons, granting them unique powers. Most of the shardbinders were wiped out by the very people who created them, leaving only Miriam and Gebel as the last of their kind. Gebel hasn't taken this treatment too well, and has partnered with a powerful demon with the goal of unleashing hell on earth. Miriam stands opposed to him, and so Gebel challenges her to find him in his demonic castle, forced to imbibe on more shards along the way, assuming she'll fall prey to the demonic influence. It's basically just a reason to have a giant Castlevania style castle in the game.\n\nThe writing in the game is of a rather poor quality, overall. There are some cute exchanges, here and there, but for the most part the dialogue, plot, character motivations, etc. are incredibly dull and tired. They feel plucked right out of the Castlevania series, which if nothing else is at least appropriate, I suppose. It's just not that enjoyable.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\n\nBloodstained feels amazing to play. From back dashing, to vertical dashing, to rapidly stomping on a boss's head turbo-Mario style, it all feels responsive and wonderful. Since some of your traversal abilities are locked to a category of shards (more on that later), you will often need to swap them out in order to progress through a tight spot or move swiftly through water. The use of quick-select shortcuts reduces some of this equipment swapping time, though you'll need to find the ability to use said shortcuts.\n\nThere are two categories of items you'll be collecting/crafting during your adventure: gear (armor, weapons, etc.) and shards. Gear is exactly how it sounds. As part of its RPG elements list, Miriam can find unique pieces of armor, weapons, and accessories that will augment her stats in different ways. Different categories of weapons have different movesets, and even special techniques that are executed like a fighting game move. Daggers are fast but low damage, great swords are slower but do much more damage per hit, spears have superior range, etc. \n\nOf equal importance are the shards. Shards drop from demons, and every single demon drop a shard specific to them. In a way your capturing the demon for your own use, in a twisted form of Pokemon. Kinda. This is the element that's taken straight from Aria of Sorrow. Shards can be incredibly powerful, if you upgrade them enough. Some are naturally stronger than others, and you'll likely be tempted to stick to a handful of shards throughout your playthrough.\n\nWhile most shards will be found out in the open world, you will be able to craft a few new ones. More than that, you'll be using the crafting system to create new and more powerful pieces of gear, usually weapons. You can also prepare delicious dishes that heal for varying amounts but also give permanent stat buffs.\n\nThe biggest complaint in this section, and really the entire game, is about the boss fights. 95% of the bosses you'll face in this game are complete push overs. There's no strategy needed to tackle most of them. Just spam your attacks and spells and eat any damage they throw at you, because chances are you'll kill them before they kill you. Generally it's unfair to compare boss fights of one game to another, but we have a special case here. All of the bosses in the spin off game, Bloodstained: Curse of the Moon, appear in Ritual of the Night. So you can directly compare how the Twin Dragons fight plays out in RotN compared to CotM. And in every single instance, CotM does it better. Again, there are a few outliers in RotN, but even those don't amount to anything more than ""Just don't get hit and hit the boss until they die."" Having played The Messenger after RotN, it's very clear how boss fights should be done versus how they shouldn't.\n\n[h1]Audio[/h1]\n\nI usually don't have much to say regarding audio of a game. It's just not an area I feel I have much expertise in. Bloodstained's score, like the rest of the game, invokes that feeling of playing a Castlevania game. There are even some tracks that sound straight ripped out of the Castlevania library (I swear I heard Bloody Tears being played). They're certainly great tracks, though.\n\nSpeaking to the English voice acting...eesh. You have some talented actors on the credits list, and yet they generally gave poor performances. Perhaps it was done purposefully, to capture, yet again, an element of Castlevania games? I can't say for certain why the acting is bad, just that the acting is bad.\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\n\nAt the beginning of the review I said the game was not a metroidvania at its core, but that being a metroidvania is all it is. What I meant by that is Bloodstained doesn't do anything new for the genre. Igarashi is arguably the reason there's a ""vania"" in the ""metroidvania"" genre at all. But since the days of Symphony and Aria, the genre has evolved. Other games in its category try to bring in mechanics from other games to help theirs stand out, and to enhance the experience. \n\nHollow Knight has the dark atmosphere of Dark Souls, along with its system of losing your wallet on death and needing to get it back. It also changed the rules for how its map system works, both giving the players more freedom to make markings on it to find their way, while also instilling a sense of dread when the player got lost from an incomplete map. \n\nThe Messenger doesn't even become a metroidvania until half way through the game. It also brings humor and an actually decent story to a genre that focuses more on gameplay than writing.\n\nBloodstained doesn't do anything new or unique with a genre that it's creator helped make. It's a nostalgic trip back to the late 90s and early 00s, acting almost as a perfect time capsule for what was big in the genre at that time. Whether or not this lack of innovation is a bad thing is something I've debated. Usually, when a game fails to innovate in a popular genre, it gets lost in the shuffle. Yet Bloodstained feels intentional to be archaic. Like the goal was to create the sequel to Symphony of the Moon Iga always wanted. It's an odd situation, so you'll have to be the judge.\n\nDespite my misgivings about Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night, I would still highly recommend this game to anyone, fan or newcomer alike.\n\n[h1]tl;dr[/h1]\n\n[b]PROS[/b]\n\n+Fast and fluid gameplay that just gets faster as you gain more movement shards.\n+Collecting shards is a strangely enjoyable experience.\n+Awesome soundtrack, if not a bit derivative.\n+Pleasing visuals, though I'll take gorgeous sprite art any day.\n\n[b]CONS[/b]\n\n-Boss fights are, by and large, hot garbage, return to sender.\n-Does nothing new or unexpected; it's exactly what you think it is.\n\n\n[h1]9/10[/h1]\n\nIf you'd like to read more reviews, guides, and opinion pieces by me, you can find are articles on [url=https://www.keengamer.com/author/sean-rehbein/] KeenGamer!

"This a pretty meh metroidvania, it borrows elements from past igavanias but it does them poorly, execution is mediocre at best and the game is a 7/10, not bad, just completely forgettable and with some real bad decisions and flaws at times that could theoretically make it a bad game for you.\n",Not Recommended
This is trully spiritual succesor to Castlevania Symphony of the Night. \nThere is ton of weapons types. \nTons of spells. \nGuns that actually worth using.\nMusic is great.\nSix hours in and only 45% of map compleated and there are multiple endings.\nAll dialogs are voice acted.\n\nCons:\nSome animations are terrible like swiming. Morrowind has better swiming animations.\nSometimes is not clear should you keep trying to reach an area or comeback later.\nThey still putted that bad blue map. So you have to memorize what place is what.,Recommended
"I helped with the Kickstarter way back and after playing the game for a while, I don’t regret it at all. This is an amazing game that really feels Old School in a good way, you can feel the care in a lot of its aspects, the gameplay is very fun, the story is ok for the moment, but the characters are charismatics and they have good designs, tons of weapons and clothes to use, interesting enemies…\n\nThe only issues that I can find for the moment are some small sound bugs when I am in the main menu and a broken descriptions of a “lightsaber” weapon. Still, the game is still excelent and very fun.\n\n",Recommended

The only complaint I could level  at this game is that it isn't LONGER (though it still took me 60 or so hours to 100% the game, albeit taking my sweet time.\n\nI backed this instantly and even though it's been 4 years in the making, I don't regret it at all.",Recommended

"A great game (with some flaws) that i recommend heartily to anyone who is a fan of Castlevania Symphony of the Night and the other games that came afterwards, notably Order of Ecclesia\n\nIt feels a lot like those two games were meshed together to be honest. Miriam's absorbing shard abilities are very reminiscent of Shanoa's powers and the general plot of the game is very close to SotN (up to a fakey , bad ending boss fight if you don't use the right item).\n\nAlso i must say this STRONGLY : The music is great. I've even surprised myself humming some of those tunes after playing.\n\nBut as great as most of the game is, there are a few glaring flaws, especially towards the last 20 or so % of the game ( based on map exploration), namely after finishing the fire caves :\n\n- The game gets rather unclear as to what you are supposed to do / where you are supposed to go. One place requires a certain Item that isnt in an instinctive place to get, which bloated my gameplay for about 2 hours of running around for nothing.\nSame happenned after the oriental labs whereas i technically knew where to go and what to do but missed a single detail in the steps to do it. A couple extra hints along these parts would've been helpful\n\n- The plot has many moments too similar to SotN to my taste and the big ""reveal"" towards the end fell flat on it's face. From the moment i met some characters i was outright thinking ""Oh, that's a bad guy"" \n\n- You do not seem to be able to read a conversation back. It can be problematic when some characters give you progression related informations and you happen to double click too quickly and miss out on helpful pointers.\n\n- One of the later power you get, Inversion, is broken. Renders many parts of the game very easy, Including multiple bosses that barely have any attacks that reach you on the ceiling while you just dominate them. It feels like the late game bosses weren't programmed with this power in mind.\n\n- The grinding for item drops can be abusively long.\n\nBut as said, even with those flaws, the game is worth it !",Recommended
"After several years in development and some questions along the way (mostly coming off the disaster that was Mighty No. 9), it was worth the wait. Fairly large Metroidvania in a very familiar style that hits all the nostalgic spots for me. More stuff like extra playable characters coming post-launch. Somewhat of a short game (not by the standards of the genre though), but still an incredibly fun and cohesive experience. There's even a rather complex crafting system, including cooking of all things.\nRecommended for anybody who liked the old-school Metroidvanias back in the day.",Recommended

Holy shit. This game. It's so good.,Recommended
An extremely fun throwback to one of the greatest games of all time.\n\nThe gameplay itself is smooth and rewarding. The shard system allows a considerable amount of variety and with skill you can overcome any challenge. Also if you aren't into getting good you can just grind it out and smash through it all which is another kind of fun. There is a fair bit of free dlc coming to expand it but the base of the game is solid. You might want to wait for some of the kinks to get ironed out but as a backer of the game I was not disappointed at all.,Recommended

"This game is a Recommended successor to the 90s and 00s Metroidvania games like Symphony of the Night and Aria of Sorrow. It features some of the best mechanics and design of each game, all neatly packed into a sprawling castle like those of old, with various secrets. \n\nThis might as well just be called Castlevania 2, honestly. Before this game I did not realize how tired the Belmont x Dracula trope had become. The new license paired with the creative freedom of being in an independent studio probably helped Iga come up with something that feels less like a collection of cliches and references and more like a new, fully-fledged experience. \n\nBut of course, there are [i]some[/i] flaws. I don't feel like being too hard on this game because it does what it does very well, and at least one of these complaints is mostly irrelevant. But the graphics, while MUCH better than what was shown in the beta, are somewhat janky and bland looking. Onto gameplay, the level design feels a bit too flat. Lots of corridors are perhaps too horizontal and featureless.\n\nAll in all, this is an excellent game. Buy at any price.",Recommended
Proof a Kickstarter game can live up to the hype. Long delays were worth it for such a wonderfully polished game!,Recommended
"I loved a lot about this game and enjoyed my time with it, that said some parts of the game can come off a little hard to face and you may need to get an ability you never got like the aqua stream ability which is a shard needed to even progress into a secret zone and if you're like me you'd think there was passive ability to help you progress but its all locked into that shard.\nOtherwise i beat the game and had a blast, the crafting was fun to mess around with all the fun easter eggs nodding to castlevanis put a big dumb grin on my face.\nFor anyone getting into the game thinking its like SotN, it very much is like it but the difficulty is amped up so expect it to kill you suddenly when you face a new boss",Recommended
"Had a lot of fun with this one, gave a lot of Aria of Sorrow vibes with the shard mechanic. Weakest part of the game is probably the side quests but everything else is just great.

"tldr; An excellent revival of classic Castlevainia gameplay with inclusions of newer ideas.\n\nI will gladly admit to being a Castlevania fanboy and a Kickstarter of the project. My first Castlevania was Aria of Sorrow, and when I got the chance I snagged Symphony of the Night and I still love playing all of these games. (And Metroid too, my only complaint in comparing the two franchises is that I suck at the original Castlevanias from before Symphony; though I still love playing them)\n\nBut now for actual review-type content:\nBloodstained: Ritual of the Night is a modern take on the Castlevania series starting from Symphony and takes most of the best bits and pieces from it and all following games in the series. Loads of weapons and types? Check. Skills? Check. Absorbing power from your enemies? Check. Sidequests? Check. Item synthesis? Yep. The best part? If you want you can completely ignore any part of these systems if you want. The game is still fully playable without using the Shards that give you extra abilities (except for the exploration shards of course) or taking advantage of making your own weapons and healing items.\n\nThe areas given to explore are nicely varied, with exceptional music to accompany each area. The enemies are as varied as one would  expect from a Castlevania game, a few palette swaps here and there; but unlike older games in the genre many of them have new attack styles which can catch you off guard. As in most games of this style, you need to watch and learn how the monsters fight unless you want to take advantage of the many healing items available.\n\nAnd speaking of items: There are tons. While you won't find much food hidden in the walls, there are plenty of chests and enemies that will give you food and potions to heal with; or you will get ingredients to cook with. Or materials to make armor and weapons with. Swords, rapiers, greatswords, and even whips are available; but don't expect to be mimicking the Belmont clan, the whips function differently but still pack a wallop. Each weapon type can use certain skills based on button prompts (like the Hadouken). These techniques use MP, but can have interesting effects and deal more damage. Naturally, different weapons will have different stats and elemental affinities to take advantage of. Armor or course will have similar effects.\n\nAs for magic, you have Shards which are won from enemies. The more of each shard you collect, the more powerful the base effect is. You can also upgrade shards using materials from enemies adding more effects to your abilities. For instance, one of the first shards you get will let you shoot fireballs. More shards will make each fireball stronger, but upgrading the shard's rank will let you shoot more out at the same cost as one.\n\nOf course, what's a Casltevania without exploration? There are plenty of hidden areas and powerups spread throughout the game, along with many things that seem out of reach but just need some creative platforming to reach as a nod to the older games in the genre.\n\nAll in all, it is a great game and I heartily recommend it to anyone.",Recommended
masterpiece for SOTN fans,Recommended
"The best compliment I can give this game is that this is the first game I feel like finishing in a while.\nI have humble monthly, a full time job and a discord server with people who focus mostly on matchmaking games like R6 siege so it gets harder and harder to motivate myself to finish singleplayer games - especially with the growing trend of games to last hundreds of hour. Don't get me wrong, I love games like witcher 3 but there's no way I'll ever finish it.\nTo come back to the game, I've played a few vania types games on steam - OwlBoy, TimeSpinners, that one game were you play as a furry with a sword, the DMV - and this definitely belongs in the good ones.\nIt has what you'd expect - a large sprawling map, lost of enemy types, unlockable movement abilities and a variety of bosses with pattern to learn and master.\nIt also has this whole crafting sytem based on materials that monster drop to strengthen your stats, your equipments and your abilities, which seems like a logical evolution to games like Symphony of the Night. However this brings us to the only real negative point for me for this game - itemization.\nSince this game wants to play with the idea that you can get better stuff and have a large variety of drops and equipment, I felt sometimes overwhelmed by the choice and relied more on upgrading what I was used to until the point where it killed everything I needed dead rather than changing my equipment to things that were clearly designed for verious types of encounter (ex: you get a bone throw which has an up down arc on it and clearly seems to be made for attacking enemies in diagonal or enemies with a shield, but why would I use that when I can just max my arrow that can shoot in any direction and just double jump over enemies with shields?). This make the game feel a bit more like an rpg than a classic platformer  if that's what you're looking for. Still, this does allow for you to stick to one kind of gameplay if that's what you prefer (I quite like the boots muyself). This game also has a lot of secrets. Some actually weird and fun items. Some character customization (once you unlock it) and at least two endings.\nOverall, this game's a lot of fun.",Recommended
"Made me nostalgic for the older Castlevania series in all the right ways. It's hard to say when something 'moves' you, but this damn well did.

Side missions are fine altho there should be more of them along with more quest givers. Most of the bosses are challenging for the time, tho they all have a exploit of some nature. Brute force also works too, final boss I cleaved with a greatsword as I was tanking hits.\n\nThe only real annoying thing is the cap on item in your inventory; potions max at 9, super max at 5, and most other stuff is 99. Cap at 99 is understandable but it's a little weird and stupid considering potions are effectively useless later in the game other than being crafting material for super ones. Even then you'll likely store prepare food items, which give much greater health-ups along with stats upgrades.",Recommended
"Brings back good memory of the 3 Castlevania games on GBA and 3 on DS. Circle of Moon, Harmony of Dissonance, Aria of Sorrow, Dawn of Sorrow, Portrait of Ruin, Order of Ecclesia. If you like any of those Metroidvania games, you won't regret buying this one. The only Con I would say is I hope the map could be bigger, such as adding the inverted castle.",Recommended
Just call it SotN 2.\n\nHad a lot of fun with it and will probably go back for another run.,Recommended
"I'm not a Castlevania fan and I've never even tried any ""metroidvania"" style games but Bloodstained blew me away.\nAn absolute joy from start to finish and a highly recommended experience.",Recommended
Good Sh*t,Recommended
A fantastic throwback to classic Metroidvania-style games with lots of new features.,Recommended
"What can i say, we need more good ""Castlevania"" games like this, plays just like Dawn/Aria of Sorrow whit the ""soul"" mechanic.\nPlaying whit the Xbox One controller is a must, it makes the same more responsive whit the D-Pad it has.\n10/10",Recommended
"Everytime someone asked me ""what's your favorite game"" I would feel at a loss. I like so many games and it's really tough to pick a favorite, and they moslty have nothing in common with each other too. Well, that changed now. The first Castlevania I played I was still a young teenager, my father bought the Dracula X chronicles for PSP and unlocked the Symphony of the Night. I knew nothing about Castlevania and had no idea how famous it was, but I picked it up and instantly fell in love with that game. Bloodstained brought back that feeling, but better, it's the game I never knew I wanted. It's not a game for everyone, but everyone can enjoy given time. I personally would suggest first playing Symphony of the Night in its entirety before Bloodstained, as I believe it brings some more enjoyment due to the nods to the old classic, but it's not necessary. For the first time in many years, if someone asks me what is my favorite game, I can answer right away ""It's Bloodstained"".",Recommended
Great game,Recommended
Just here for the grand prix qualifying thing.,Recommended
"An absolutely beautiful addition to the Metroidvania collection: tight and satisfying controls, magnificent soundtrack, and the map layout all comes together so nicely! 9.5/10",Recommended
"Amazing game with a lot of life behind it! Music, atmosphere, and over all art is absolutely stunning!",Recommended
"This is just like soul collecting vanias and its great, the second half of the map was lacking though.",Recommended
Better than what would normally be expected from a kickstarted game.,Recommended
"An amazing game, if you loved SOTN this game is perfect for you.",Recommended
"Great game, hadn't played the Castlevania games before trying this, but I had an idea of what I was getting into thanks to other reviews. Definitely glad I tried it.",Recommended
hollow knight is better but this is fine too...,Recommended

Buy this game if you love Castlevania.,Recommended
As some one that loved sotn this is an awesome game!,Recommended
"Good, very good",Recommended
"Doesn't quite live up to SoTN quality, but almost! I enjoyed it quite much for the most part.\n\nOnly negative points are those spots in places where you have no idea how to get into, if you don't stumble on them accidentally and final boss was way too easy. \n\nOther than that, really liked it and totally recommend this to all fans of the genre.",Recommended
"Great 'Castlevania'. Same music, mechanics and enemies. It may seem a bit slow, and some mechanics work a bit weird to my taste though. I really like Metroidvania games, and at the beggining thought Bloodstained was kind of boring.\nMy mind has being changing slowly to the point where I really think it is a great game, with a ton of details I didn't expect from it. I just wish it had been a bit faster and full 2D anime or cartoon like. The 3D models are beautiful but feel akward sometimes.\n\nLet's be honest. Just play it while you wait for Silksong :D",Recommended
"This game perfectly captures what made Symphony of the Night and Aria of Sorrow so good.\n\nIt's not perfect by any means, and there are plenty of problems. However, almost all of those can be looked past since it's just genuinely that enjoyable",Recommended
"Even though the game doesn't look that good, it more than makes up in gameplay. Each area is unique and interesting, the powers are all useful, the bosses are challenging and stand out from each other, and we have a cute protagonist!",Recommended
"A toybox of systems, rewarding exploration, great boss fights, just a real good videogame.",Recommended

"Very Enjoyable throwback to PS1 and DS Castlevania's!\n\nFinally finished this game and while I have some issues with some of it's features, it was a lot of fun and I enjoyed the game from start to finish.\n\nPros\n-Exploring the castle is enjoyable.\n-Tons of weapons and equipment to experiment with to find your unique play-style.\n-Different demon powers for you to use and destroy your enemies with.\n-Fast paced and varied combat.\n\nCons\n-Can be buggy, although nothing game-breaking (for me anyway.)\n-Lack of direction (Places where you had to go back to are not memorable at times.)\n-Difficulty curve is all over the place. (2nd boss is one of the hardest then almost nothing is difficult till near the end.)\n-Magic does take a backseat in combat due to the high MP costs.\n\nOverall though, I really did enjoy my experience with the game and it will be one I come back to time and time again.",Recommended
Fantastic homage to Castlevania games.  Definitely worth the pickup.,Recommended
"Igarashi really did it again, this is a perfect tribute to Castlevania SOTN and really goes beyond that with interesting mechanics like the shards and crafting. Great graphics, solid performance and awesome soundtrack. What else could we want? 10/10",Recommended

\n[h1]This game is a sequel to my childhood.[/h1] \n\nThank you Iga and everyone else work worked on this game. \nThank you to all the backers too. Without you this would have never happened.\nIt really did live up to everyone's expectations.\n\n,Recommended
good game,Recommended
pretty good,Recommended
"Finally, a game that scratches that metroidvania itch. Other games have tried but never did it for me. If you enjoyed any of the metroidvania Castlevania games from Symphony of the Night till Order of Ecclesia then this game is for you.",Recommended
"An amazing metroidvania which made me feel like I was playing Castlevania Symphony Of The Night,loved every second of playing it ,I cannot wait to see the upcoming DLC's.",Recommended
Did you like Symphony of the Night?\nTry this.,Recommended
Great game,Recommended
"Pretty good if you like Castlevania: Aria/Dawn of Sorrow, but I've had a few annoying glitches so far.",Recommended
"If you liked Symphony of the Night, this is a very enjoyable game. A great successor to the Castlevania games. The visuals don't always feel like the work together, especially when you're on the galleon. The exploration and collectibles are excellently done. There's plenty to explore, and there's enough shortcuts getting around that you don't feel like your wasting time back tracking to explore an area again with new powers. The game also gives you mechanics to help with searching from shards if you're having any trouble.\n\nAdditionally if you like this game, look for a game called Timespinner. It's similar in style, but a little smaller.",Recommended
The Igavania you've been waiting for.\nCould have been longer though.,Recommended
"This game is amazing, thats all.",Recommended
Amazing game,Recommended
"Finally, the spiritual successor to the Castlevania series, mixing all the most interesting parts of the previous titles!\n\nThe game plays a lot like the all time classic Castlevania: Symphony of the Night; big castle, lots of secrets, a few hidden areas, good boss fights and tons of items to use and equip. It also incorporates mechanics from later titles, such as the shards from Order of Ecclesia, alowing you to get new skills (or even familiars) from every different monster you kill.\n\nThe progression is also very good, this time it manifests in the form of shards from bosses giving you new abilities allowing you to reach previously-inaccesible places.\n\nThe castle size is smaller that SotN but it's still plenty to explore; it took me roughly 42 hours to finish and find most of the secrets (about 95% completion).\n\nAll around a great game for fans of the series and new players alike.",Recommended
"If you enjoy old school Castelvania-esque games, this will be perfect for you.  I enjoyed this so much on PS4, I bought it on PC as well.",Recommended
"Only finished the game today and I can say this. The game keeps you busy if you're into metroidvania and fair grind. (And by fair, I mean fair. Not ridiculous, not too easy, just right.) I played on normal but there is also hard and nightmare. The game offers lot of areas to explore, character customization. Tons of weapons and items to find and make, recipes and quests to clear. None of this felt like a chore to me. Some parts are more difficult even when prepared but otherwise great game from start to end. It's the castlevania I needed for PC.",Recommended
"This game definitely deserves a thumbs up. It is a project made by people who understand and are passionate about this genre, and it definitely shows. It is highly enjoyable and extremely addictive.\n\nI haven't completed the game yet, and I will update this review as I go along. However, this is a simple pro/con list for what I've seen so far:\n\nPros:\n- Great Soundtrack\n- Good voice acting\n- Well-designed map that is fun to traverse and explore\n- Diverse pool of enemies that are mostly fun to play against\n- Large selection of weapons, magical skills and buffs that allow for a variety of different play-styles\n\nCons:\n- While I appreciate the lack of hand-holding in this game and how it rewards exploration and player initiative, there is one very particular moment so far where it could've seriously benefited from nudging the player towards the intended target.\n- Killing an enemy close to any wall or other vertical surfaces could result in their loot clipping into that surface. The player would then be unable to collect that loot. It isn't a major issue, but it happens often enough to become distracting.\n\nGreat game overall. Highly recommended for both Metroidvania fans and newcomers to the genre.",Recommended
This game is the successor to the old castlevania games i was hoping for.,Recommended
"I can remember a time when I was sick of every post-SotN Castlevania following the same basic formula. Yeah, I was kinda dumb. After years of trying to find a game that'd deliver that same feel, Bloodstained is finally here. Was it worth the wait? Yes. Does it live up to the hype I had for it? Also yes. Never thought we'd get another game quite like this and I'm loving every minute. Check it out.",Recommended
its like symphony of the night and dawn of sorrow had a baby and got rid of sorrows stupid touchscreen gimmicks.\nIgarashi is a god and has proven that he does not need the castlevania name to make a sick game.,Recommended
Basically Castlevania,Recommended
Поклонники жанра метроидвании не проходите мимо,Recommended
good,Recommended
Bloodstained feels like the spiritual successor of castlevania symphony of the night and dawn of sorrows. So if you are looking for a good old fashioned metroidvania game with great gameplay and visuals then give bloodstained a try ^_^,Recommended
"What else is there to say that hasn't already been said? A faithful recreation of Playstation 1 and Nintendo DS era ""metroidvania"" games, with some modern mechanics and systems added to push the genre forward. If you enjoyed those games, you're almost certain to enjoy this one.",Recommended
Fantastic game especially if you're a fan of the genre.,Recommended
One of the best games I played so far!\nNot only its like Castlevania it has so many other things to do and collect!,Recommended
good stuff,Recommended
Plays like Aria of Sorrow and packed to bursting with Jojo references.,Recommended
"If you want a deep well treated Metroidvania, play the spiritual sucessor of the original Symphony of the Night.\n\nDevelopers are not only nice to include the 13 free DLCs coming (excepting the extra boss DLC), but soooooo many secrets and strange reactions that you will summon a chair in the carpenter room to see if anything happens (doesn't look likely).\n\nNote to hardcore gamers, search for secret codes online to start the game in nightmare/hard difficulty (your choice).\n\nThe game runs very nicely in a bad laptop like mine after setting everything to minimum, dual voices (I definitely recommend Japanese...). Lore is deep enough without being overwhelming and there is enough content to assure you at least a minimum of 20 hours of gameplay in the main quest and exploration of the castle, needing 40-50 to maximize Achievements and exploring 100% the map, with extra game modes like boss rush and speed run and the option to start from level 1 in the hardest difficulty.",Recommended
It's real igavania.,Recommended
Very good,Recommended
Game good.,Recommended
"If you played and liked Castlevania: Symphony of the Night, Aria of Sorrow, Dawn of Sorrow and Order of Ecclesia then you will most certainly like this one.\n\nSure it doesn't have the slick 2D artstyle and the cutscenes here are absolute garbage, but everything, every weapon, every Shard (think Souls or Gyphs from the other games), every piece of movement tech is very Castlevania, with level design to match.\n\nSolid PC performance too, east 144fps with no dips, completely playable with keyboard too but it's definitely designed to be played on a controller.",Recommended
Very nice game.,Recommended
God tier.,Recommended
"exactly what a castlevania fans wants, fuck konami",Recommended
another metroid-vania worth your money,Recommended
"Bloodstained is great - really brings back memories of SotN.\nThe crafting is a nice feature, though it does bring its own grind to fully make use of it.",Recommended
"If you loved Castlevania and wish you could have a new sequel that scratches the same itch as Symphony of the Night, this is for you. It's a great experience, has a lot of replay value, and a great price! Don't sleep on this!",Recommended
Such a fun game. Pleasantly surprised.,Recommended
"This is a game that is not without flaws, but those flaws are the same as the last three portable Castlevania games. Fans kickstarted a IGA-vania in the hopes of him recapturing that magic, and IMO he completely succeeded. I've 100%'d this game in about 4 days, which is more a testament to my obsession than the game's length. It's fantastic, and I can't wait to play more once alternate characters are patched in. Here's hoping this is the first of many!",Recommended
great game,Recommended
"Amazing trip down memory lane. Scratched an itch I didn't even know i had. This game is by no means perfect. It's very rough around the edges and you could've even go as far to say it's kind of subpar in front of something like Hollow Knight. However, i loved this game. It brought me back to middle/high school when i played these kinds of games a lot. It did this in the most perfect way. So it's definitely a win for me, and i would also add, for anyone else who grew up playing these ""Symphony of the Night"" kind of Castlevania games. This is very much that kind of Castlevania game and it's glorious.",Recommended
Love it,Recommended
good game,Recommended
Great game\n,Recommended
Symphony of the Night 2,Recommended
"Runs well, plays well, It's Castlevania without the name. \n\nPeople say there are better and cheaper metroidvania out there. That's nice and all but I wanted a Castlevania like those I played on the DS and this game here is exactly that.\nSure there are some minor annoyences but nothing that would change my recommendation.",Recommended
"WATCH OUT FOR TECHNICAL ISSUES!\n\nThis game was created using Unreal Engine software (probably the latest patchs).\nI've experienced constant game crashes, and cutscene glitches due to hardware lack of support.\nMake sure you ask/search before buying!\n\nBesides all of these, I'm reviewing the game for what it is; The gameplay, graphics, audio, design, etc.\nThis is a Castlevania lover review...\n\nPros:\n*Huge ""open"" world/castle to explore as you play in this... Metroidvania (? And I mean huge! (I didn't even explored it 100%)\n*Crafting system (? I don't like crafting in this sort of game, but it is easy to do, and lets you obtain enemy drops without killing the enemies.\n*I would better liked if the character has a different cosmetic slot for items, so you don't equip op things because of the stats, but the look. -Yeah, Miriam wears the items you equip visualy.\n*It is quite hard. I mean, I've only played 1st difficult by now, and it was HARD.\n*...It is another Castlevania! There is a lot of hidden plot referencing older ones. Even the base gameplay feels like Dawn of Sorrow, and the others from the same Sequel.\n*Cute graphics I must say, even tho I have 16gb ram, 6core processor, and 8gb of gpu; it keeps lagging, and audio keeps glitching!\n*The soundtrack is what you expect; you wouldn't expect more coming from Michiru Yamane, and Ippo Yamada; Compositions like Voyage of Promise which you'll hear across the castle rooms are the ones that make you feel you're playing Castl... I mean Bloodstained.",Recommended
"Throw money on the man who made Castlevania games with sub-par budget and you can damn believe he will make a even better game.\nBloodstained takes the usual Castlevania tropes and mechanics and refines them to a level I couldn't imagine possible. The game had a bumpy start, some people had their chests already opened up when the first patch was released. Personally I had no issues at all with the game from day 1.\nMusic is great, character design is depends from person to person but I loved them, Solid Snake playing Zangetsu.",Recommended
"Amazing game, brings me right back to the nostalgia of playing SotN as a kid!",Recommended
"Igavania is back and it's addictive. A good 15-20 hours game if you take time exploring and farming to get everything. Good voice actors, english and japanese audio available. The game is pretty easy on normal but there are three difficulty settings. Also multiple free DLC incoming if a great game was not enough.",Recommended
"If you liked castlevania: symphony of the night for the gameplay alone then you'll love this game. While not as much lore has been defined here as in the castlevania series, the story, voice acting and music are all top notch here. (granted i played with the japanese voice overs so your mileage may vary on the english side of things)\n\nNot gonna lie though the game has some jank to it, a couple of bugs here and there. Annoying as these bugs are they really don't impede overall fun or gameplay elements though.\n\nIf any of what i wrote peaked your interest then toss IGA a few bucks so he can throw more shade at konami.",Recommended
"Delivering on it's Kickstarter promises, Bloodstained delivers an authentic experience in the vein of Symphony of the Night and is sure to delight Castlevania and Metroidvania fans alike.",Recommended

"I am not a frequent flyer in the ""Metroidvania"" genre, but always had an interest in the dozens of games that populate it. Many can be overwhelming in the sheer flexibility, difficulty or complexity that inhabits the game. Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night, however, makes it accessible to newcomers while retaining the appeal of its forefathers. With a large map to explore, plenty of customization options to suit your playstyle, a fairly simple yet engaging (enough) story, and like-able cast of characters, Bloodstained has the all the bells and whistles needed to be a standout in the genre. It is perfect for beginners and veterans alike.\n\n+ Appealing graphics and sound design\n+ Great Map to get lost in\n+ Decent story and characters \n+ Fun moment to moment gameplay\n+ Feels like a love letter to Castlevania\n\n- A bit of learning curve to figure out the magic and combat\n- The story uses a lot of archetypes and cliches from the genre. This is intentional but some may not like the lack of nuance \n- Doesn't revolutionize the genre, which may turn off those looking for something new\n\n8.8/10\nHighly recommend to Metroidvania fans; Recommended to anyone interested in exploring the genre",Recommended

Iga wanted to make one of these and that's exactly what he did.,Recommended
I'm only a few hours in but this game brings back all the amazing memories of sotn!,Recommended
"As all the other reviews say, it's Castlevania, and a good one at that.  \nIt also doesn't overstay its welcome, running at about 25-30 hours if you're looking to 100% the map, the bestiary, and upgrade your abilities moderately before going for the final boss.\n(Take a seat and look over the lake for a while why don't you?)",Recommended

very good,Recommended
Worth it.,Recommended
"I've always loved Iga's Castlevania games. As far as I've played, this is pretty much the Castlevania game I've been waiting for. It's got many nods to Iga's games (some subtle and some not so subtle), as well as many tiny details that make me like this game much more (for exemple, try holding up for a few seconds or waiting a bit on the piano chair while having the Carabosse shard equipped). \n\nThe game is still a bit buggy, but hopefuly it will be patched in the future.",Recommended
"As mentioned by previous reviewers; if you enjoy SOTN then you will not be disappointed by this game at all. There's even a chance if you may actually enjoy this game over SOTN, especially with the upcoming content being released such as Zangetsu's campaign.",Recommended
Best castlevania game since the last one he made,Recommended
it's very good,Recommended
"Good, Almost everything I expect from a metroidvania just wish it ran a bit better so I don't have to worry about a error crashing the game and have to replay a part 3 times. I would recommend if you like these types of game but need to run a touch better is all.",Recommended
GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD SHIEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEET,Recommended
"Having played Castlevania games from SoTN on wards. i can honestly say this is a faithful spiritual sequel to that legacy, IGA who directed SoTN really showed his passion and love while making this game. anyone who loves SoTN or the DS line of Castlevania type of games will instantly fall in love with this one. I did back the game when it was first crowdfunded and never regretted it.\n\nthere are plenty of secret walls, weapons and skills to produce a large variety of playstyles with a nice emphasis on exploring every part of the castle for a power up hidden somewhere.\n\nhowever my only of criticism for this game is near the end of the game. while i will not go into any major details for warning of major spoilers. one of the bosses provides you the ability to warp. and while the other mobility powers (like double jumping), have quite a few and nice areas that require it. the warp ability is only neccesary to access a single area and a side quest. and i felt that it was under utilised. as a whole i think the end of the game could do with a little bit more length, it does to me anyway feel like it wraps up very quickly all of a sudden and bam. final boss.\n\n\n\n",Recommended
"Great game, will be playing this alot.",Recommended
"A very solid metroidvania.\n\n20something hours of content, 30ish hours to 100% achievements.\n\nPersonally no performance issues or crashes.\n\nVery straight forward, a couple of different paths you can take, and a couple of overpoweredly fun abilities and items.\n\nAbsolutely recommended if you're a genre fan.",Recommended
Excellent spiritual successor to SOTN and probably the closest thing to a new Castlevania until Konami bites it.,Recommended
"This game is pretty sick. If you liked symphony of the night or aria (or any of the others), its hard to not recommend this game. Very addicting to play- exploration is fun, all the combat abilities you get are cool, and there's lots of customization. Also free dlc coming up as well. Can't go wrong for $40.",Recommended
"[i]""What is a man? A miserable little pile of secrets!""[/i]",Recommended
"This is every Castlevania game Iga has ever worked on stapled together with the ugliest coat of paint possible, but it has the most stuff to grind out of anything he's ever done so you'll love it if you have brain problems and can spend 30 hours to have only 3/4 map completion.",Recommended
Amazing Game!  Spiritual Successor of  Castlevania,Recommended
"I waited patiently for 4 years when this game was first announced and the Kickstarter began. It was more than worth the wait. Beautiful soundtrack, level design, and visuals all come together with amazing gameplay and combat. Definitely a must buy for any fans of metroidvania style games. The replayability is insane with so much to find and near endless ways to play and build your character.",Recommended
"Fair warning to potential buyers of the switch version: Don't. just buy the PC or PS4 version instead.\n\nthat said, this is the Castlevania you've been waiting for and if you aren't buying it already, what are you even waiting for? this game's got as much passion behind it as Crosscode, and i don't spout Crosscode these days lightly as that game is also a gem. but seriously, this is a must buy for any casual fan of Castlevania or diehard belmont main in Smash Ultimate who swears they only main him because it's the closest thing to Castlevania these days",Recommended

Symphony of the Night 2.0. EXACTLY what I wanted,Recommended
"Never know what you're going to get from these Kickstarter games. Bloodstained turned out to be an excellent successor to the Castlevania franchise. If you enjoy the Metroidvania genre, you need to check this out!\n\nPros:\n- The game play is as good as one can expect from the creator of Castlevania\n- Plenty of items to collect and craft.\n- NPCs through-out the game to assist in some way and/or offer side missions.\n- Graphics are good (the graphical overhaul they announced a few months before release definitely helped)\n- Fantastic sound track!\n\nCons:\n- Facial animations when characters are speaking don't look as smooth as they should be. It's like there was a low polygon count limit to the character models and they decided afterwards that they'll be animating the mouths.\n- Occasionally, some words from the dialogue boxes are missing. This seems to only affect certain conjunctions from what I've seen so far.",Recommended
"If you enjoyed Symphony of the Night, Aria of Sorrow, or Dawn of Sorrow, this is exactly what you're looking for, albeit at a slightly lower difficulty.\n\nThis game is a side-scrolling action platformer in which you must explore a cursed castle and battle demons, with the goal of making yourself strong enough and learning enough new skills and abilities to make your way deeper into the castle and take on progressively more dangerous bosses. Killing various monsters earns experience points and dropped equipment and materials, including ""shards"" which the main character is equipped to absorb and give her new abilities relevant to the monster that dropped them. Gaps in the player's arsenal can be filled with the in-game alchemy system, which converts materials collected by the player into new weapons and armor and prepared food, with food giving small but permanent bonuses upon sampling them for the first time.\n\nThe graphics for the characters and enemies are somewhat simple, with most effort having gone into the environments the protagonist explores. Sound design is average overall, cutscenes are fully and mostly competently voiced, with very good musical themes for each area of the castle and boss encounters. Controls are crisp and responsive, with occasional moments where the edges of platforms are a bit unclear due to being 3D objects intersecting the 2D playfield.\n\nThough somewhat on the easy side in the initial playthrough, unlockable difficulties are available at launch. A good value overall for the $40 price tag, which will improve significantly if the developer follows through with promised free DLC updates.",Recommended
"There are so many similarities to Castlevania: Symphony of the Night, I would die before I could type them all. IF you liked that, you'll like this. There are seriously points where it just seems like they reskinned the game. Easter eggs a plenty and a solid exploration space to play in.",Recommended
"Iga is back doing what he does best. This is a solid game with mechanics taken from SoTN and Aria / Dawn of Sorrow. The castle map is large and it has some nice monster variety. The bosses are a little on the weak side and the graphics are kind of weird, but everything else is great. Definitely recommend.",Recommended

"New castlevania, what more do you want?",Recommended
"Classic Iga Metroidvania, with a heckuva lot of positives, a few 'quirks', and not a lot of complaints. It's definitely going for a Symphony of the Night vibe in more ways than one, but there's not a lot of negatives to be found. \n\nA few bosses in the mid-game are too easy on normal, and if I'm being honest a few of the shards (power ups) are a bit same-y, but the feeling of exploration, collection, and getting stronger will keep you going.\n\nIf you like the style/genre, you owe it to yourself to check this one out.",Recommended

A must for fans of classic Castlevania. Addictive gameplay and lovely art with intricat exploration and customisation that opens up many fun possibilities. The prime example of Kickstarter done right.,Recommended
Waited four years for this game and it's everything I could've asked for. Can't wait for the added content to be released.,Recommended
classic igavania,Recommended
Excellent! All the good old memories just came back.,Recommended
"Great game so far! As expected from the originator of  the ""Metroidvania"" game! very reminiscent of Aria of Sarrow!",Recommended
"This game feels like what a Recommended sequel to SoTN would be, instead of just a spiritual successor.  The controls are tight and the combat is well done, with just the right amount of challenge.  Like SoTN, if you finish it a bit early, you don't get as much content.",Recommended
"A Great game with a lot to see and do.  Bright colorful graphics, challenging bosses, item crafting, quests  and several large environments to explore.  I haven't actually fully completed the game yet.  but have the map to 99% and just have to fight the last couple of bosses.  But from what I have said seen, done and experienced, this game is definitely a must buy at any price considering the amount of content that is there that will keep you searching for new and interesting things.  There are a few QoL improvements and a few minor issues that I would like to see addressed, but those don't stop this from being a great game.",Recommended
"A well-made return to the classic Metroidvania form, without the Castlevania. I wasn't a backer to the project, but I can definitely say I was very pleased with how it all turned out. Biggest issue I saw was item drop glitches where they get stuck in a wall and can't be obtained.",Recommended
"Once they patch all the glitches. This is a solid 10/10 games. On par with SoTN. It's a step above Axiom Verge, and Timespinner. Which is not an easy feat. Easily game of the year, 2019.",Recommended
"They delayed the game for over a year because people were unhappy with the visuals among other things, and came back with the game looking ridiculously better; all of this from a kickstarter funded game, unlike Keiji Infaune's Mighty No 9, this game actually deserves your money.\n\nAlso, the only paid DLC is something that WAS exclusive to kickstarter backers, but they voted to make it available for everyone at a fair price that doesn't belittle the backers contributions, all other DLC will be post-release free updates including a character voiced by David Hayter.",Recommended
Awesome,Recommended
good game,Recommended
Having been a backer for this game right around the first day it popped up. I can safely say it has been worth the four year wait to get my teeth into this game.\n\nIt was a great time seeing all the old tricks still work that I could do in the older games and I just had a blast with it.\n\nIf you enjoyed the old Igavanias. Then you will like this one.,Recommended
This game is big fuck you to konami and i love it. \nGame has old school castlevania style game play so its top-notch if you like 2D games music is awesome this is metroidvania\nat its best. I totally recommended this game even at its full price.,Recommended
"It's Symphony of the Night with some added mechanics from Iga's other games. While not anything revolutionary and has it's quirks (intentional or not), the design is great. As a first run into what I hope is turned into a franchise helmed by Iga, it's fun and something that was long overdue.",Recommended

"I'm glad I waited to finish the game for before reviewing because now I can say without a doubt or hype bias that Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night is phenomenal. I've played all of Koji Igarashi's Castlevania titles and this one is tied for my all time favorite Symphony of the Night, but I also enjoyed Rondo of Blood which was the title starring Richter.\n\n・Extremely tuned combat and beautifully crafted music from series veterans\n・Artistic stylized graphics and good voice acting bring life to the game\n・Well optimized for GPU and CPU performance at well over 60fps\n・This game has an average of 276fps at max settings on a GTX 1060 6GB\n・Lots of modes to try and even Nightmare difficulty for those who want a Recommended challenge\n・Frame smoothing keeps the game nice and smooth at your display's native refresh rate\n・Bloodstained has the potential to surpass Castlevania and I want to see where it goes next\n\nI absolutely recommend this to fans of Metroidvania titles or those who are Recommended Castlevania fans, but if you want Classicvania there's also Bloodstained: Curse of the Moon",Recommended

Great Metroidvania and the spiritual successor of the Metroidvania 2D/2.5D Castlevania games. Technically a bit rough around the edges. Had two crashes in 13h playtime. Luckily I save often and generally this is something you should do as often as possible as you losse all progress since your last save also when you die.,Recommended
"Quite decent game, old recipe new flavor. For those who have never tried metroidvania games this would be a great one to begin with.",Recommended
"Remember the Castlevania games of the DS era? Order of Ecclesia, Aria/Dawn of Sorrow, being most evident in gameplay, accompanied by Portrait of Ruin's desire for diverse locale and enemy designs. Remember how Symphony of the Night set the standard for a good Metroidvania? This is a love letter, a spiritual successor, an unofficial sequel to the series, since IGA and KONAMI had their divorce and kept custody of their child only to neglect them.\n\nIf you like the genre, you'll love this game; otherwise, you will find this game either too easy or too hard, but it'll be worth giving it a shot.",Recommended

"It's unashamedly Symphony of the Night. \nBiggest pro is the constantly rewarding exploration and acquiring new powers and weapons to try out, it's very satisfying in that way. Growing stronger makes the game feel very different as you use these newfound abilities to squash whatever comes your wayt. \n\nBiggest con is the challenge of the game is quite minimal, a lot of the more challenging bosses can be cheesed out in some way and even if you're not trying to cheese them out, just using some weapons or powerups against them is so powerful they kind of melt away before you even get a good fight in.",Recommended

"While by no means perfect, Bloodstained is a textbook Kickstarter success story, and one that I was glad to contribute to and be a part of. If you're looking for classic metroidvania platforming, a soundtrack full of real earworms, David Hayter being his usual wonderfully-growly self, and most of all a fitting homage to the Castlevania series as a whole, look no further; this is a Recommended Castlevania title in all but name.",Recommended
Great RPG elements and the classic Castlevania feel makes this game a huge blast. It was worth waiting for so long to get my hands on this masterpiece. Great game!,Recommended
Pretty nice Metroïdvania.,Recommended
"Disclaimer: I am an original Backer from Kickstarter.\n\nBloodstained: Ritual of the Night is the Castlevania KOANI doesnt want to give us in all but name.\n\nIt probably is the closest we wll ever get to a new ""Ritual of the night"" in modern days, with as little deviateion from the 1997 design philisophy as possible.\nThis leads to some frustrations in places, where some things are way more complicated then they need to be, crafting being a prime example.\n\nBut in the end IGA has to be commended for the effort to bring us a classic IGAvania as one could get, and for listening to feedback to touch up the assetes instead of pushing the release through the door.\n\nSO all in all I reccomend Bloodstained, IF you want to play a very classical Metroidvania and/or are a fan of the Gothic artstyle of the classic Castlevanias of old.",Recommended

"Se você gostou do Castlevania: Symphony of The Night, este jogo é o sucessor espiritual que você estava esperando.",Recommended
"Symphony of the Night is easily one of my top five games of all time, so I had pretty high hopes for Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night. Luckily, it lived up to its potential and then some.\n\nEverything I loved about SOTN is here in full force: A sprawling, varied environment full of nooks and crannies to explore, a wide variety of weapons with unique and sometimes gimmicky features, an incredible soundtrack, and tons of little secrets that are a joy to discover. In addition to these expected features we now also have a rewarding crafting system, a series of side quests for villagers, a huge number of ability-imbuing shards to collect and upgrade, and a customizable main character. Even some minor flaws from SOTN have been addressed; For instance: where in SOTN the food you found was more or less pointless, here every unique dish you consume gives you a permanent stat boost, offering incentive to go ingredient-hunting and try every recipe. This attention to player experience permeates every aspect of the game, offering a rich experience that offers more the more you're willing to put into it.\n\nIf you love SOTN, you owe it to yourself to play Bloodstained: ROTN. It hits so many of the same beloved beats while offering a new level of depth, polish and content. Absolutely outstanding. Iga knocked it out of the park as far as I'm concerned.",Recommended
Worth the wait! I'm glad I backed this game!,Recommended
"You liked SotN?, you will find what you are looking for in Bloodstained",Recommended
Has the same feel as SotN and takes things from gba and ds castlevanias. Well worth it.,Recommended
"Really fun gameplay, never got bored fighting monsters and farming for shards. Hoping for more character customization options though.",Recommended
"I'm surprised, but also very happy that Konami has not sued. It's so similar to previous Castlevania entries that anyone who was a fan of those metroidvania's will feel right at home.",Recommended
"It's not quite as good as Castlevania SOTN, however it is very close.",Recommended
"It's nice to see a crowdfunded game that ends up being worth the crowdfunding. Though I personally only heard about the kickstarter when it was already over, I've been looking forward to this game for some time, and it did not disappoint.\n\nOverall, the presentation is great. Graphics are good, different areas are easily differentiated, and music is good. Enemies within the same typing tend to have slightly different models on top of simple recolors, which is also nice. Bosses are varied and interesting (though I did encounter a bug where I fell through the floor during the fight with the twin dragon, which allowed a legendary level of cheese rather than fighting between the two heads as intended), with only one fight repeated for story reasons.\n\nThe addition of fighting game commands (a lot of fireballs and dragon punches) to several weapon types for special moves is an interesting touch, but I didn't seem to run into very many for Greatswords, my particular favored weapon in my initial run, now complete. I wish I'd gotten more of a chance to interact with that mechanic.\n\nIn addition to standard leveling mechanics, grinding is also encouraged by the shard system. Five categories of special abilities gained from both mobs and bosses allow for a degree of customization and provide an incentive to slap enemies around for a long time. Shards can also be enhanced at one of the shops with drops, and passive category shards can be turned on permanently if enhanced to the maximum threshold.\n\nTwo shops are available- a money based shop, which wasn't much good for me apart for purchasing reagents for the second shop, and the alchemy shop. Bring your nerd some ingredients and watch equivalent exchange bring you weapons, armor, items, and lunch.\n\nThe food system is kind of odd, frustrating to search out drops for, but very rewarding. The first time you consume any prepared food item, you gain a persistent stat boost. Usually more pedestrian stats, but its also possible to increase your MP regeneration and EXP gain.\n\nSo yeah, pretty good. My only complaints would be a somewhat slow base movement speed and alchemy listing for weapons and armor being a bit hard to see what you should be looking for to move to your direct upgrade of your current weapon. That's because stuff you can make is listed at the top, and what you can't is listed at the bottom.",Recommended
"A good game if you're into the metroidvania style of games because it controls fine, there's plenty of map to explore and secrets to find and allows for plenty of customization with all of the items you find.",Recommended
Had reservations about it due to being a crowdfunded (already have a trauma regarding past crowdfunded games) but this game did not disappoint. Game plays smooth and I enjoyed every bit of it.\n\nI just wish there was more to play.,Recommended
There are a couple points in the narrative of the game that can leave a player confused as to how to continue progress but that's all I could fault this overall fantastic addition to the metroidvania genre.,Recommended
"This is basically the best bits from the last 5 or so Castlevania games. If you liked those, you will LOVE this.\nHighly polished, smooth gameplay and a massive map with loads of extras/crafting etc make this a must have if you're into this style of game.",Recommended
"If you love castlevania games, you're going to love this game too!",Recommended
"A very good new Castlevania-style game by Koji Igarashi.\n\nIt doesn't do too much that's new or exciting, in my opinion, and the story sucks, but it's a big game with a lot of content and it combines the best elements of earlier Castlevania games together into one experience.",Recommended
best metroidvania game to date!,Recommended
"This game is a real nostalgia trip. It bears many of the bones of Castlevania: Symphony of the Night but still differentiates itself by adding much more with crafting, various optional quests and the shard system. \n\nPros:\nBeautiful visuals\nCompelling soundtrack \nFamiliar but polished game play\n\nCon:\nHad a minor glitch with the on screen text during a dialogue scene where one word didn't appear.",Recommended
"Gotta say, I didn't realize how much I missed playing SOTN until they nearly remade it with a different name.",Recommended
SOTN 2,Recommended
"First off, i'm not good at reviews and second this is for the grand prix, third it's also to say what a good game it is.\n\nI've played it for hour hour's for a couple of days total, haven't really got down and sat at it to completely get lost in it, however what i have played is fun, amazing & a wonderful game.\n\nI haven't ran into any issues, run's fine, no crashes, no game breaking bug's, no minor bug's and everything just works for a actual completed game for once to be delivered like the old day's.",Recommended

"Perfectly nails the classic Symphony of the Night/Aria of Sorrow-style Castlevania game, with some cool twists.

Bloodstained does a fantastic job of filling the hole left by Castlevania.,Recommended
"Bloodstained is a ""Metroidvania"" 2.5d platform game with RPG elements and a big emphasis on collection and exploration (also known as ""Igavanias"", since Koji Igarashi is responsible for popularizing the genre). It mixes elements from a bunch of his successful titles, namely Symphony of the Night and Aria/Dawn of Sorrow. Much like SotN, you explore a castle full of perils in a non-linear style of gameplay, that requires you to revisit places you've seen before after acquiring the correct means to reach them, while keeping some places secret from the player to encourage thorough examination of every nook and cranny.\n\nBesides the usual metroivania elements, this game employs a good deal of RPG elements, like character progression and equipment, as well as learning spells and techniques. But also, it reintroduces the ""soul"" mechanic from the Aria and Dawn of Sorrow Castlevania games, in which you have a chance to get a ""shard"" every time you kill an enemy - shards that you can equip on your character for various purposes. \n\nNow for the review:\n\n[h1]The Good[/h1]\n\nThat Igarashi is a master of the genre is unquestionable. He knows how to keep you hooked. He knows exactly what fans of the genre want and delivers it. And that is, a game that checks every mark of a good metroidvania, a game that entices your inner explorer, that person who wants to explore every last % of the map, who wants to get every [strike]soul[/strike] shard in the game and every item drop, and uncover every secret.\n\nAs said previously the game draws on every positive aspect of the successful Iga titles. You have the leveling up, the equipment, the items, and the familiars from SotN, you have the extremely addicting Soul mechanic from Aria/Dawn/Ecclesia games, and with an additional few ones like crafting and cooking. All are there and pretty what you'd have hoped to get. After all these years, Iga is still clearly the master of its own territory.\n\nAlthough I have some not so positive things to say about other aspects of the game, in the end what matters most really is the game itself and in that sense, this game was a definite success.\n\n[h1]The ""Meh""[/h1]\n\nThe story and worldbuilding are serviceable at best. While Castlevania's lore stands as one of my favorite vampire stories, Bloodstained's lies under its shadow and fails to be very memorable on its own. Rather, it borrows the same base motifs as the original story, not making many efforts to obfuscate the parallels with the source material, and only switching a few components in order to divorce itself from Konami's IP. But in the end, while it replaces X with Y, the equation is the same.\n\nRegarding the protagonist, while her design is interesting, she suffers from ""Designated Protagonist Syndrome"" and is very forgettable. This is not necessarily a bad thing on its own - after all you could say the same about practically every single Belmont - but still.\n\nAs for the music, Michiru Yamane, the composer of the masterpiece soundtrack of Symphony of the Night, does a job that on its own is competent if not quite good, but disappoints in knowing what she is truly capable of. A lot of times I felt like I was listening to music that was commissioned to another musician who was told to make music that [i]sounds[/i] like Yamane. It reminds you of SotN, and shares similar melodic tendencies, but has less of the genius and ""fire"" of the original. There were a few tracks that I really enjoyed, though.\n\nLastly I'll mention that the balance of the game is not the best - some weapons and skills are clearly better than others and some equipments and shards you pick up along the way you'll use overwhelmingly more than others. It's not super game-ruining but if you like having choices in terms of character builds you'll not be very pleased. (This is unfortunately Iga's weak point as a designer - his other games are not much better with this either.)\n\n[h1]The Ugly[/h1]\n\nOh boy, here we go... First of all, I really don't know in what part of the process did they think that this game's graphics stand up for today's standards. Especially for a game with a multi-million dollar budget. \n\nThe game is completely 3d, and while I understand the decision - 3d models are much easier to animate than hundreds of sprites - it still baffles me how poorly executed it was in the end. It is especially disappointing having played all of the Iga games and knowing just how good these games look now having been released years and years ago compared to this 2019 game that just came out a little over a week ago (as of the writing of this review).\n\nWhile the quality of the graphics vary and some things definately look good, the overall aesthetic of the game looks downright weird if not shoddy. The closer elements of the background look like they were either made of plastic or wax, and the further elements look downright embarrassing with pointy polygonal rocks and flat terrain. Nothing really seems to mesh together well, it's like the different elements of the game don't really exist in the same universe - the characters have a distinctly different rendered look than everything else, and someone thought it was a good idea to surround each character with this overblown lit contour that makes the characters look like they were badly photoshopped in from another environment.\n\nWhy couldn't they have fully embraced Ayami Kojima's great artistic vision, by perhaps employing a more painterly 2d style more in line with her work, with perhaps a mix of 3d wherever it facilitated the workload? Or maybe stuck to its roots and went with the good old pixel art, maybe with a few modern twists. There are so many ways they could have done this right, so many ways to make something much more eye-catching and pleasant to look at.\n\n(What is funny to me is that from the looks of the earlier previews, this game was supposed to look [i]even worse[/i] at first! Thus after some backlash, they decided to give the graphics a little polish... In my opinion though, and to be perfectly honest, that didn't help much.)\n\nAnyway. Lastly, I have to mention the bugs. There are quite a few bugs in the game, namely a very common one (so common I really don't know how it passed through testing) that causes dropped items to be stuck to the floor and be unretrievable, at least until you wait a minute for the game to automatically pick it up, which I imagine was the developers' lazy workaround to the problem.\n\n[h1]Summary[/h1]\n\nIf you, like me, have been waiting for a good Igavania for years, this game will not disappoint you... too much, at least. It is a solid game, a game which could have looked much better and have a more unique story and setting, but still a fun game that is worth getting. And if you're a fan of Igavanias it is a no brainer.",Recommended
This game is the bomb-diggity.\n\nProtip: Don't equip the safe ring without paying attention to its stats at the beginning.  I was doing one damage until like level 10 because I didn't realize it ripped away your precious attack power.  The bats took 3 hits to kill.  BATS.  After unequipping the ring and tossing into mount doom the game jumped to 10/10.,Recommended
"It's a very deep metroidvania game, tons of move customization options, explorable locations, crafting recipes, etc. etc. I am having fun just making different builds for my character, as there are over 100+ different skills and weapons you can mix and match from, all with different attack animations and tradition 2d fighting game like input commands.",Recommended
kova peli! SOTN 2,Recommended
"Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night is a high-caliber Castlevania title in all but name.\nIn my opinion, ArtPlay managed to make a solid metroidvania which doesn't fail to impress in all areas.\n\nIts visuals are a great treat, with a gothic feel with anachronistic sprinkles on top throughout the game from the design of the castle itself, the enemies the player faces (Like, for example, the demon who attacks by rocking out) the protagonist herself and the equipment(weapons, armor, etc.) she can use.\nThe animation is pretty darn good, especially effects and boss animations.\nBut what I really loved was that animations during combat never seem to hamper the gameplay with overly complex movements that seem to have no other function but to show off while still remaining visually impressive and interesting, which is something we don't see very often in other metroidvania titles.\n\nThe audio is also pretty good with the best part of it being, of course, the music.\nThe work on the music was exemplary and Michiru Yamane really killed it.\nThe sounds were what I expected, more or less, with a few exceptions (the demon rocking out, for example).\n\nThe gameplay is satisfying with the combat never feeling stale or boring due to the plethora of weapons and shards(magic) which alter the fight styles of the protagonist or give her special abilities(like throwing fireballs, summoning the aforementioned rocking our demon, etc.).\n\nAll in all, I wholeheartedly recommend this game.\nIn fact, I love this game. This is one those games that are worth the price of admission.\nEvery single cent of it.",Recommended

"A truly great Metroidvania that offers a fair amount of replayability.\n\nThere is a vast array of weapons, active abilities and passive boosts to farm and craft. They are ranging from whips to great swords and chain lightning to a barrier of protecting portraits, while being accompanied by flying heads or a sentient sword, just to name a few. The sheer amount of gear to choose from enables a plethora of playstyles, so everyone will find a setup fitting their preferences.\nI personally enjoyed the visual presentation combined with the well fitting music very much.\nThe map design is alright and works well with the mobility improvements you unlock throughout the journey. Albeit some of those progression tools are well hidden and force you to really explore with a minimum of hints. Something most games lack these days, much to my dismay, I might add.\n\nI recommend to create a file with the name ""NIGHTMARE"" (you can delete it afterwards) to unlock hard and nightmare difficulty right off the bat, if you prefer to have a challenge.\n\nCertainly worth the price tag.",Recommended
"finally, a good game",Recommended
"TLDR: If you are a fan of Castlevania: Symphony of the Night or the GBA and DS Castlevania games then you'll almost certainly enjoy this.\n\nIf you aren't familiar, this game follows the Metroidvania formula. You explore a large castle and the surrounding areas until you can no longer progress with your current items and abilities. Then, you either explore in other directions or re-examine what you currently have to overcome the obstacle in question.\n\nPositives: \n\n[+] The layout of the castle, variety of environments and enemies within, and the distribution of secrets made exploring a pleasure. The ability to mark the map with waypoints (seemingly as many as you want) to remind yourself of areas you want to revisit was also a welcome convenience.\n\n[+] The ability to set loadouts of equipment and spells becomes available early in the game allowing you to swap between different builds on the fly. This encouraged me to experiment with more playstyles than I normally would.\n\n[+] I loved the music. I can't really elaborate on that. I just enjoyed it.\n\nNegatives:\n\n[-] I had no idea how to progress at several points; which while Recommended to former Castlevania games in this style was not something I was expecting in 2019. I ended up having to visit the Bloodstained subreddit to get hints after wandering around aimlessly for awhile in one case.\n\nNote: The Shopkeeper does give hints at certain points. However, this dialogue is never repeated if you mistakenly skip through some of it, and as far as I could tell this information is not stored anywhere for you to view later.\n\n[-] The map always opens in a zoomed out position. This would be a minor nitpick, but with the amount of times you'll be opening the map this becomes bothersome quickly if this is not your preferred behavior.\n\nOther:\n\nThe art style is not going to please everyone. However, I felt the graphical effects and perspective shifts on display were cool enough to justify the use of 3D instead of sprites.\n\nI did not encounter any crashes in 50+ hours of play. Performance was a solid 120fps at 1440p on my NVIDIA GTX 980 Ti everywhere except a single boss fight where the framerate dipped slightly. I imagine more recent graphics cards will have no problem running this game flawlessly.",Recommended

"Great game indeed at first wasn't sure if I can enjoy this game (Even though I backed it) but my worries were crushed in few hour's\n\nBloodstained is created by Koji Igarashi (father of Castlevania) & it shows first I though that this game is merciless to players who haven't played original castlevania like games \n\nbut soon I saw that this game gives plenty of tools/skills/gear to progress can't beat a boss?? go back & collect materials/shards/exp from demons to make it easier etc.\n\nso if your interested in castlevania games this one will deliver or if 2D platforming is your interest give this chance \n\nonly gripe that I have is doing the weapon combos but that is just my personal issue to overcome x,D",Recommended
"This game is not perfect by any means, but if you love GBA/DS Castlevania games, this one is a must.",Recommended
"Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night is a modern take on Castlevania: Symphony of the Night and the DSVania game's.\nBeing developed by Koji Igarashi himself, this game share's a lot of similarities from his previous work, and I feel like it doesn't try to hide that fact.\n\nThe movement and combat feels tight and satisfying.\nAlmost all enemies can drop shards (similar to souls from Castlevania: Aria of Sorrow), these shards can give various sorts of magic, aswell as passive bonuses or familars to fight alongside you.\nThere's plenty of weapons and weapon types, which can be either found throughout the castle, drop from enemies or crafted.\nThe crafting has quite a bit to offer yet still maintains a simple feel, most of the items can be found off enemies with the exception of a few.\nOnce you've crafted an item you can buy it out of the store, this also includes materials.\nBeside weapon and gear crafting you also have the option to make food.\nEating a food item for the first time will give you various permanent stat bonuses.\n\nThe level design is on point as well.\nThe map is very large, and most rooms feel meaningful in some way making exploring everything a lot of fun and all the area's feel and look really good.\nMy personal favourite was the first underground area.\nAlthough not a fan of the water mechanics, the area itself was especially fun to explore and had a great athmosphere to it.\n\nThe animations, art style and music are in my opinion some of the best I've seen this year for a game, or in a long time for that matter.\nThis is the Castlevania experience I, and many others, have been wanting for a long time, and the wait has been worth it.\nI highly recommend this game to anyone into any sort of platformers/metroidvania's.",Recommended

Symphony of the Night was (in my opinion) already outdone several times by later Castlevanias (I liked Aria/Dawn of Sorrow, Portrait of Ruin and Order of Ecclesia much more) and I'd say this ranks right up there with them. The game's visuals aren't perfect and there's some general jankiness going on, but aside from that this is a worthy addition to the man's resume. Once all of the free DLC releases the game should become even better.",Recommended

"It's a really fun game.\nMy current save file has over 25 hours on it and I enjoyed every second of it. \nThe shard mechanic is a fun idea I'm glad they brought back from the Castlevania Sorrow games. If they make sequel, I hope they bring it back and try to expand on it.\nThe characters are rather basic and aren't as interesting as those from Symphony of the Night, which this game seems to stick to quite heavily. If there are going to be other games, I hope they expand on them to make them a bit more interesting.\nThe graphics are nice and well-designed, I enjoy the character and monster designs. Though some repetitive sound effects can be changed for the better.\n\nI never needed to grind throughout the game since most of the time I just went and bought more potions or food to just power through them. Also, I wish there was someone in town that could give a hint sometimes since the game leaves you clueless as to where to go at points. Having someone there would definitely help people who are stuck.\n\nAlso, please allow us to grind boss or unique shards to grade 9, it bothers me having them all be grade 1 when every other shard is rank 9 and grade 9.\n\nIn terms of overall structure, I think it tries to stick too closely to how Symphony of the Night was laid out. If you've played that game some rooms will look VERY familiar (e.g. a waterfall room). Having call backs to that game is fine but when you start taking rooms from it, it feels kinda shallow. I also feel that the castle doesn't have as much character as it did in Symphony of the Night. That game had rooms with secrets and little side stuff (e.g. the confession room or the bird Easter Egg).\n\nOverall, I feel like this is a fun and great game for fans of Metroidvania and I can see this becoming a fantastic series to replace the hole left should they try to improve it with sequels. If you're new to this style of games or want to try it out, Castlevania Requiem on the PS4 let's you play Symphony of the Night as well as it's prequel. I implore you to try that game out first before you spend twice as much on this game if you're feeling unsure.",Recommended
"I haven't played many of the Castlevania games after SOTN and I have to say, this game is basically SOTN 2. It might be just a bit too similar in layout but I don't mind at all. The music is great and feels very similar to SOTN but with it's own twists, and the gameplay is good. I thought I would miss the lack of Belmonts, Dracula, Vampires etc. but I can get over it pretty quickly, and enjoy the newer setting. Excellent game, highly recommended.",Recommended

"If you like castlevania, definitely give this a try. The level design is similar yet different unique compared to the old castlevania, the combat and difficulty is like Order of Ecclesia with a few added technique input (like those special weapon move in dawn of sorrow, though this time much more varied). The story is simple and pretty straightforward, not bad but not really great either. If you found the crafting system in dawn of sorrow tedious (using soul to craft), then rest assured this game's crafting won't take your shards (soul ability) to make stuff. The added food crafting and their bonuses are also nice. Oh and the best parts are: you fight Snake from Metal Gear, fight DIO from JoJo and most importantly: you can Za warudo and throw knives!",Recommended

"Old-School metroidvania for both good and ill. On the good side, this game oozes with that igavania atmosphere and hits that sweet spot between schlock and camp, the kind of glorious ridiculosity where a grapple-hooking magical samurai teaming up with a bunny-eared golem girl to fight a train makes you go ""ah, yeah, that's about right."" On the less good side, the endgame is a bit poorly signposted, and even looking up spoilers I ended up futzing about a fair bit to figure out where to go, and while we're nitpicking, some platforms you can stand on doesn't read perfectly, visually. Those nitpicks kind of pale in comparison with how fun the game is, though, backdashing around an evil castle that definitely doesn't belong to one Vlad Dracula, swinging whatever weapon I felt like at the time is one of those retro joys that doesn't get old to me.",Recommended

Also, if you like a certain weapon or spell,you can easily use them for the entire game if you spend a little time upgrading it.\n\nIt's so enjoyable to play a game that isn't lazily done,doesn't try to pry your brain open and manipulate you,and just tells you to enjoy your time ,listen to the music and relax for a bit...\n\nIt's just not something you can find everywhere.\n\nA more than worthy sequel to Symphony of the Night and other GBA/NDS Castlevania titles.",Recommended
"I binged this one, and got more than my money's worth out of it.",Recommended
Epic game!,Recommended
"Absolutely love, love, love this game. Bloodstained: ROTN is definitely a worthy successor to one of my favorite games of all time, SOTN. Fans of SOTN will definitely enjoy playing through ROTN as it takes the foundation of SOTN & builds upon & improves elements that made it so great. The gameplay mechanics just work flawlessly. Very easy to get use to. The graphics are gorgeous, very noticeable from the early progress of the game. Very happy to see Wayforward being brought in to contribute to this title to enhance the visuals. And the soundtrack is superb. I have 40+ hrs in this game & I couldn't be happier to have pre-ordered it. Huge map, plenty of items, weapons & abilities to unlock. This game is truly a masterpiece with plenty more content on the way as well. Koji Igarashi is definitely one of the industries greats & ROTN reiterates why. Thank god Igavania is back!",Recommended

"Master Iga knows how to make a great game, you will not be disappointed. go ahead and buy it!",Recommended
I was looking forward to this game and it delivered in many aspects. From the countless jojo meme's to the old school CV feel. I really have enjoyed my time. There are some issues with the sound that have never be resolved and the price is a bit much. But I think it's a great game that fans of the classic metroidvania games should try out.,Recommended
It's pretty much Symphony of the Night 2 which is everything I ever wanted for the past 20 years.\nThis game is amazing.,Recommended
"One of the best metroidvanias out there, a ton of weapons and skills a pretty good map and some really cool bosses.",Recommended
"Early into the game but enjoying it all the reviews were right about this, its good",Recommended
"There are too many reskinned same type enemies but thats the only downside for me however gameplay, level design, music and rpg elements are settled well. Huge variety of spells(shards) and weapon techniques makes the gameplay experience unique.",Recommended
"Kickstarter backer here, I have to say that it is exactly what I was hoping for. 10/10.",Recommended
"Fantastic game. I haven't binged a game like this in a long time. 100% map and demon completion and I'm gonna wait for one of the free DLCs to come out before I do NG+. Absolutely worth the money. If you're wary about the price, look at other sites like GMG, GOG, or Humble Bundle, as they all may have their own sales going on (all offering steam keys of course).",Recommended
"the is like dark souls, thats all you need to know\n\n(and it has online modes too)",Recommended
Great game.,Recommended
"Look ma, it's not pachinko.\nIt looks and sounds great, plays well, and it has a lot of callbacks to the 'vania series. \nI have a few minor gripes, but they don't get in the way of my enjoyment of this game. I had a handful of crashes, not sure what caused them. It may be on my machine more than the game itself, and the shard and crafting aspects of this game can be grindy. \nIf you're looking for a big shiny review about technical aspects, this isn't it. This is here to reinforce the opinion you've (probably) already got. Buy this game. It's good.\n",Recommended
"I played the game at a friends house, only gripe was that the difficulty was too easy.... so I bought it after beating it there and I adore it.  There is so much care put into the game, the developer actually listens to the community and I really hope going forward that this becomes the standard of games going forward.",Recommended
"This is my first try at a Castlevania typ of game\nAnd I love it, had a bit of trouble at the first two bossfights but after that I had a great time playing",Recommended
"This is what Castlevania could have become if Konami continued in the sidescroller format for the series.  Call it what you will, Igavania or Metroidvania or whatever, it's well within the top 3 of that genre.  A large amount of unique weapons, accessories, and shards pretty much allows whatever playstyle you prefer.  If you loved Symphony of the Night, this is a fantastic spiritual successor to that game.  The only criticisms I have are some text errors, and a grind if you want to completely 100% the game as it currently stands.",Recommended
fun,Recommended
"Fantastic, the graphics look solid, the gameplay is exactly what you'd want from a Metroidvania and overall is just a very fun experience",Recommended
A Castlevania with a different name. That is the simple description of this game. \nIt's well composed with great gameplay mixing upp a bit of this and from Symphony of the Night and onwards.,Recommended

"Let's start by saying I like a good metrodvania game. This game is definitely a good metrodvania. However its not perfect as there are certain circumstances that are considered flawed.\n\nCons:\n1. I'm actually playing with a controller and first time on launch it works however upon launching the second time, my the game actually stops receiving input after the ""press start"" screen. I had to actually look up on ways to fix it and for those who might encounter this as well, this is the fix\n- Right click on bloodstain and go to properties\n- Under steam input per game setting, change it to ""forced on""\n\n2. There is a certain boss that is considered utterly bullcrap because this boss had one particular attack that is completely impossible to avoid no matter what you do. [spoiler]This boss is gremory and her purple curse projectile attack is the one that cannot be avoided even with a shield shard because that thing curves around and homes in on you. You will also have no time to react to it and jumping as well as invert doesnt help either.[/spoiler]\n\n3. There are times that you need to rely on RNG to progress. For example:[spoiler]You need to obtain a shard that allows you to maneuver around the water which will lead you to the next major area and it literally took me 2 god damn hours to finally get the enemy to drop that shard. This is unfortunately the only way to progress[/spoiler]\n\n4. There are certain areas that were swarmed with [spoiler]Malediction(these guys will turn you to stone)[/spoiler] and some of these areas have hazardous obstacles that will take away 10% of your hp if you fail to get past them.\n\nPros:\n1. Graphic - Graphic is actually stunning. And I'm literally talking about the new improved graphict and not the old one.\n\n2. Playable in japanese audio with english sub(japanese voice is way better). Don't understand why would anyone play this game in english audio but then again its personal preference.\n\n3. Combat - just like your typical old school castlevania\n\nOverall I would rate this game 7/10.",Recommended
Love this so much. brought back memories of playing SotN for hundreds of hours.,Recommended
Absolutely what I was hoping for when this announced. \n\nThe only thing I will mention and this could be viewed as good and bad is that some of the locomotion skills you pick up are a bit later than SoTN but it's good to still be getting cool new toys right to the end. \n\nReally looking forward to the DLCs and also hopefully a sequel,Recommended
"What's that you played symphony of the night 200 years ago like me? Well this is basically a new one and it's dope amazing music, visuals are spot on, any farming that had to be done rarely felt like farming I recommend this game highly  especially for the Jojo refrences hidden within.",Recommended
"Backed the game because I wanted another game like the DS Castlevania games from Igarashi and he delivered.\n\nIf you enjoyed Symphony of the Night, Aria of Sorrow, Dawn of Sorrow, Portrait of Ruin or Order of Ecclesia this is a game you will enjoy as well.",Recommended
an amazing love letter to the metroidvania style. backed it back in the beginning of the kickstarter and am not disapointed would definitly purchase if your considering <3,Recommended
"Great game, would get all achievements again.",Recommended
"No Symphony of the Night, but a fantastic trip down memory lane.",Recommended
If you liked Sotn or like metroidvania games in general you will most likely like this game as well.\n\nOverall I'd give it a 9/10 mainly because of a few bugs that need to be patched out. Nothing I could really add to what hasn't been said already in other comments.,Recommended
"If you are truly yearning for something akin to the Castlevania series after it added the exploration, leveling, item collecting, and power gaining, then this fits the bill pretty well. I haven't really anything negative to say beyond that there is an annoying bug that sometimes occurs where your player model loses their head in the pause menu, and it causes the game to crash.",Recommended
"What can I say, this game is truly both a spiritual successor and homage to Castlevania: Symphony of the Night. It not only feels like a modern take on the classic, but it's a whole new world with exciting game modes and features. The music is phenomenal, and the colorful visuals are stunning. The fact it can run on a potato is pretty impressive in itself. I'm looking forward to the upcoming free DLC, and all the excellent additions to the game. Igarashi, Artplay, and 505 games did a fantastic job!\n\nI marked received as free, however, this is due to receiving a key for funding the game via Kickstarter. I paid well beyond retail price, and I can honestly say I think it was well worth it.",Recommended
This game has JoJo references!,Recommended
"Exellent example of a good metroidvania game.\nEverything you would expect from a metroidvania is here.\nAnd we will still be getting free DLC for the game. It cant get much better than that.\n\nOnly few very minor things to whine about:\nGraphics might not be the top tier compared to current standards but it still looks good.\nOnly bad thing to say is that the map is so huge, you sometimes get confused where to go next.\nFew more different markings for the map would have been nice, maybe they will get patched later.\n\nIga did it again! Sadly had to wait this long for another Igavania.",Recommended
Soundtracks great and it builds upon all the stuff that made Castlevania Symphony of the Night on the PS1 amazing.,Recommended

Is neat,Recommended
"Very good game, love it. One if the better Igavania games.",Recommended
Well if you want a rather fun challenge with a little tricky map you can find it here. This game was very well designed in my own opinion. It is not a long game. My normal playthrough was 34 hours somewhere about there. it would be a lot shorter when you know where to go and are not stuck trying to find your way. Finding your way though make the game so much fun.,Recommended
I do not regret backing this on kickstarter all those years ago. This is the first game in a long time that pretty much immediately made me want to 100% it.,Recommended

"the game is awesome, everything from the npcs and mobs to the bosses is great, you will get used to the weird 3d modeling.\n\ni just wished we had more variety in the weapons and a smoother and more polished spells.\n\nonly negative thing is the game isn't big enough.",Recommended
"It's the game we all wanted it to be. Symphony of the Night 2, jank and all, and I love it.",Recommended
A grate successor to the original metroidvania games,Recommended
"An entertaining game so far, though there seems to be a slight delay when jumping or attacking. The delay isn't overly annoying, but does cause issues for the combos required for the alternate weapon attacks (I wish they would just allow you to assign it to a button on the controller instead). I have no issue with the kick starter backer portraits, though I wish they would display the portraits at random instead. I like the material farming aspect of the game, but would have liked more villagers to interact with (like the farmer, and the vengenace lady). I really like the game's gothic aesthetic, but some of the rooms seem disjointed from the others (and I find it funny that after beating the first boss the ship is still moving as if it was at sea instead of having run aground as its shown).\n\nAll in all, I'm happy with my purchase, and hope this becomes a regularly released series in the future. And speaking of the future, maybe they could do a future title in a futuristic setting, in the vein of like Aliens. Perhaps an abandoned, decrepit, rusting space station, in need of some pest control.",Recommended

Although playing it for 2 hours i can already know that this game is great and gets a decent 8.5/10 since i've always wanted to play games similiar to Castlevania SotN. Plus people complain about difficulty so here's some ways to ramp up difficulty:\n1.Complete the game with the knife only and no shards\n2. Do what they did in SotN and do a naked Alucard run\n3. Hardest of them all in theory is a pacifist run where you don't kill any enemies except for bosses,Recommended

Absolutely outstanding so far.\nDefinetly go for this version and not the one on Switch.,Recommended
"This is almost like Castlevania Symphony of the night but I would like to give suggestions. To enhanced the replayability I thought it is a good idea to add some elements from Diablo 3. This is just from my personal experience and just a personal suggestions. Since Bloodstained is gonna launch multiplayer mode and adding different characters, I can imagine it will be nice if the characters have different set ups and different style of playing just like the different classes of Diablo 3. Make the bosses drop weapons with different rarity or different stats so that people have a reason to team up beating the boss and not get bored by aquiring weapons of the same stats all the time. Some players do enjoy making overpowered characters and this will give them a reason to keep on playing the game over and over again just to get the perfect weapons with pefect stats. Make players be able to bring saved games to increased level of difficulties with higher drop rates just like Diablo 3 which keep adding new modes of difficulties so that even after a player achieved an overpowered character they will be challenged by a new mode of difficulties. I am not talking about the nightmare mode which is more for the hardcore gamers just like Diablo 3 which also have the hardcore mode for the hardcore gamers. Thank you Iga for making such an outstanding game. I have always been a longtime fan of your work.",Recommended
"Never played the game that made everyone so excited for Bloodstained, but now I'm going to have to go check it out! There's a lot to see, collect and do. The 3D graphics are used in unique ways for a side scroller. I'm just really digging it so far.",Recommended
So far has been great. \n\nGorgeous game with great atmosphere.,Recommended
"No problems running with  i7-4790k, great game",Recommended
~Finished Story Review~\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nI will say this. If you are a fan of this style game this is a must grab game. My time playing this game alone should show that. As of this review I have 33 hours in this game and have finished the Iga DLC and story. I loved every part of this game and the various abilities were amazing. Wish there had been more familars though. Found myself over using the Silver Knight.\n\nAs for bugs I had some random boss going off the map stuff or skills sounds going off but never seeing the actual skill. Nothing to complex or hard to deal with. Nothing stopping and starting again didn't fix.  I like the story though I didn't quite like the change in attacks to Alfred and Gebel.  The voice of Snake coming out of Zangetsu brought a whole new level of epic to the character. \n\nOver all this game was 9/10 mainly due to how short of time you could finish the actual main game in if you were skilled enough. \n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~,Recommended
"Good game, very much feels like a classic Castlevania.",Recommended
"There is good reason that fans Metroidvania games - myself included - backed this Kickstarter.\n\nThe result is a great game with lots to do, a solid variety of equipment and enemy variation and a plethora of environments to explore.\n\nPerhaps the most outstanding thing about the game is that it actually stuck to it's Kickstarter promises at all - an increasingly mythical beast these days...",Recommended
"This game is blooming good, aside from a few setbacks, like massive amount of space between words as if something got deleted but the editer didn't fix that, randomly odd longer load times when changing rooms, and a few other things I barely notice.",Recommended
I like this game,Recommended
"If you had that itch to play Symphony of The Night again but with a new coat of paint then this game is for you. It's a fun little romp with great music, tight gameplay and fun little secrets and Easter eggs to find. The game does have its fair share of glitches though and it does feel a tad too familiar at times but I would still recommend it to anyone who's in that Metroidvania mood.",Recommended
"It's Aria of Sorrow, but more.\n\nIf you like the IgaVania generation of games, then yeah, this is great, but you already knew about this game.\n\nFor people unfamiliar with Castlevania, this is a real good way to introduce them to it.\n\n",Recommended
I have played over 12 hours and I absolutely love this game. Thanks Iga,Recommended

Game is good yes,Recommended
This is the best Castlevania since Aria of Sorrow and the best  Metroidvania in Steam. The king claimed back his throne.\n\nI was really surprised by how good this game is. While not perfect (I would prefer 2D graphics and the animations don't look that good sometimes) it's such a pleasure to play.,Recommended
"Disclaimer: Backed this game way back in the Kickstarter.\n\nBeen waiting for this game for years, and after all this time, do I think it was worth it?\nWell... yes. Yes it was.\n\nIt's basically just what I was hoping for it to be, another igavania/metroidvania, just without the Castlevania name.\n\nIf you like any of the igavania castlevania games, or the 2D Metroid games, or any game like them, I recommend you give this game a try.",Recommended
"If you liked Castlevania: Symphony of the Night, you'll like this game. It's a bit more difficult, but evens out near the end of the game, especially if you take the time to level up your shards.",Recommended
"Do you love Castlevania? this is your game; do you love learning new weapons, magic and fiends to help you? this is your game; do you love to see a girl with personality and good legs? well...THIS IS YOUR GAME!",Recommended
"Just to note, I know the game isn't even finished yet as of writing this. We still have more content coming and plenty of bug fixing, but it's still wonderful as is.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nThis game is beautiful and incredible. I haven't been so inclined to binge a new game as hard as this in a long time, and it was absolutely worth it. I was enjoying it so much that I ended up getting all achievements, then it was still fun enough that I maxed out almost every single Shard to Rank 9 Grade 9 (meaning I spent a lot of time grinding) except for the few you can only get once per playthrough, which I might still max eventually. If I had more time, I might even play through on Hard from the start as opposed to on New Game+ (since it's obviously pretty easy to beat the game on any difficulty with everything maxed). I even went so far as to kill every single boss (including the ""super hard"" DLC boss) without taking damage for the medals you get (even though they serve no purpose other than to say, ""You did it!"").\n\nJust get the game. It's more than worth it.\n\n\nThere are fatal errors right now that you can get, which is the only real problem. I didn't encounter any while casually playing, and only started encountering them after I began doing crazy and obscure things that most normal players wouldn't. My only ""problem"" I had during the game was the fact that item bags can drop inside places you can't reach, which can be frustrating. It's a small complaint though at that.",Recommended
"I was one of the people who backed Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night when its Kickstarter campaign launched back in 2015. The prospect of getting a new game by Koji Igarashi, the man behind classics such as Castlevania: Symphony of the Night was enticing to say the least. \n\nIn the years that followed however, several prominent Kickstarter funded games, perhaps the most notable one being\nMighty No. 9 ended up disappointing. This combined with hearing news about the development of Bloodstained not going entirely smoothly made me anxious about how the final game would turn out.\n\nWell, the game is finally out, and I'm happy to say that Igarashi and the development team did an excellent job with it. Everything from the visuals, audio, and most importantly the gameplay feels just right. It should be noted that the game stays extremely close to Symphony of the Night, for better or worse. However, there were different improvements that I appreciated, such as being able to set markers on the map, which really comes in handy for marking points of interest.\n\nI did run into some glitches while playing, the most serious one being a certain pool of water that for whatever reason, I couldn't get out of. Luckily, I had an item that made it possible for me to warp out of there. If I didn't have that however, I would've had no choice but to reload my most recent save file. Other than that though, the issues that I ran into were minor and consisted of things like items dropped by enemies getting stuck in walls/floors.\n\nOverall though, I was surprised at how solid the game felt. Of all Kickstarter funded that I've played to this day, I would say that Bloodstained is easily one of the more polished ones. If you're a Castlevania fan then I think you're gonna love Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night.",Recommended

And if you're a SotN fan, it's a no-brainer.\n\nI only played SotN last year, but I absolutely loved it and couldn't stop playing once I started. Bloodstained: RotN had the exact same effect on me. It was everything I wanted it to be as a spiritual sequel to SotN, and it plays exactly like I wanted it to as well.\n\nI'm so glad IGAvania lives on, and also glad to see another successful Kickstarter story.",Recommended
It's exactly what was promised: a very well-executed Castlevania-type game.,Recommended
SotN 2019 edition.,Recommended
Oldschoolish = Awesome,Recommended
Top das Baladas!,Recommended
"Really enjoying the game so far.  It's my first Metroidvania and it doesn't seem to be too overwhelming or hard.  Some aspects of it can be a bit grindy, such as farming for items or shards to craft better equips.  Other than that, I have been loving the game as a new player to the genre.",Recommended
"Speaking as a Castlevania fan and Kickstarter backer...\n\nPros:\n- Follows the Aria of Sorrow formula while bringing some new ideas to the table\n- Various weapon types to choose from, and every enemy has a different ability you can learn\n- Exploration feels rewarding, and there are many different environments to stumble upon\n- Lots of DLC on the way\n- Ties together nicely with Bloodstained: Curse of the Moon\n\nCons:\n- There are a couple places where it's difficult to figure out how to progress, which will probably stump some new players\n- Can we please have an option to turn down the volume of the player character shouting with every attack, without also turning down the volume of all the voiced dialog?\n",Recommended
Check all the walls,Recommended
If you enjoy SotN or Aria/Dawn of Sorrow then you will enjoy this game,Recommended
Im bad at games like this but the rpg elements in this make it very accessible. its so much fun.,Recommended
Is that a mother******* JoJo reference???,Recommended
Best Metroidvania,Recommended
"Fantastic game that kept all the best elements of the best Castlevania games.\n\nOnly downside I'd say are the bosses that are relatively easy, never requiring more than two tries to beat them without any consumables.\nI'd also liked to have more puzzle rooms and unique rewards for beating the boss rush difficulties.\n\nAside from that, fun game with a decent length and 13 free DLC incoming that are sure to kick-ass and probably more than double the gameplay.",Recommended
"A great game for fans of the Castlevania titles after Symphony of the Night, awesome soundtrack, beautiful visuals, the gameplay is pretty cool, I recommend it for real.",Recommended
"While I have not fully 100% the game yet, if you have any sort of attachment to the Castlevaina: Aria or Dawn of Sorrow, I could not recommend this game more. Yes, I do have problems with the game, mostly the voice acting and plot. However that was never why you played this kind of game. It was to search and explore a massive castle. Have several different options and only get more as you progress though the game. Play it, it's worth the 40.",Recommended
Pretty nice game for Castlevania fans,Recommended
"It could be a little harder and do not give you the good stuff only in the late game, but still is a great game anyway.",Recommended
Amazing game.,Recommended
"A ""Symphony of the Night"" style game from the creator of the original. Steal enemies powers to progress and defeat stronger foes. Smooth gameplay highly reminiscent of the original.",Recommended
pretty amazing!,Recommended
fun game,Recommended
Very good,Recommended
"An excellent, if very traditional, Castlevania successor. Old school gameplay sensibilities are enhanced by modern technology and production values, plus some quality of life improvements. Highly recommended - particularly as the PC version seems to have far fewer bugs (at least now, a week after launch) than its console cousins.",Recommended
Is the best modern Symphony of night,Recommended
"As an original day 1 backer, I am pretty satisfied with what I eventually got after the years of waiting.\n\nWhile the game is not perfect (opinions on how well the art style was eventually translated to the game's graphics and the game's difficulty turned out wary, but personally I'm fine with both), it is very much exactly what was promised - an Igavania with everything that fans of this style expect of such. It's a shame not all of the extra content, that was ""unlocked"" by blowing through the original Kickstarter funding expectations, did not make it for launch day or week, but I'm looking forward to experiencing all the extra modes and other pieces of content still coming. If my absolute blast of a first play through is any indication, I am yet to stop enjoying this delicious semi-nostalgic cake.",Recommended
"If you like Castlevania: Symphony of the Night and you played it back when it came out, you will most definitely enjoy this game. You'll enjoy it both in terms of nostalgia and mechanics. I was apprehensive at first, but I've enjoyed every minute of this game. This is a real Ode to SoTN.",Recommended
This game is a love letter to every SotN fan out there. Thank you Iga-san!,Recommended
"Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night is a great game and an excellent Igavania.\n\nI liked the story okay, though it did feel a bit ""by the numbers"" in parts.\n\nThe gameplay is fantastic, if you've played titles like Symphony of the Night and/or Aria of Sorrow, you'll know precisely what you'll be in for. The shards offer a nice amount of variety in playthroughs, but there are a few that are noticeably more useful than others, I found myself using only a fraction of the shards by the end of the game, despite having collected all the ones I could.\n\nI was initially a bit suspicious about the presence of crafting mechanics in the game, but it's not forced on you and I can see the game being beatable without ever bothering with any of it. After a few hours of gameplay, I did finally give crafting a go and it was pretty simple and fun to do.\n\nLove the soundtrack, too. There wasn't a single track in the game I got tired of listening to despite spending hours at each location.\n\nOverall, I loved this game. It is extremely similar to all the post-Symphony Castlevania titles, which I personally really enjoy, but I could see someone feeling it might be a bit samey. I'm definitely going back to the game to further complete my save and maybe replaying on a harder difficulty later.",Recommended
I could not recommend this game more. As this is my first venture into the metrovania like games I love it so damn much. If you even have a passing interest in this game do yourself a solid and give it a go.,Recommended
"Rough around the edges, but one of the best Metroidvanias in years.",Recommended
"2D action and search platformer. Fun and tight controls. Explore a castle, level up, collect weapons and learn spells. \n\nPuts the Castlevania back in metroidvania: dark themes, lots of gameplay customization options. \n\nVisuals are nice! Don't be fooled. Some areas are better than others, sure, but sometimes this game is really beautiful. \n\nIs it better than Hollow Knight? Good question...",Recommended
This is the sequel to Symphony of the Night we awaited for so long,Recommended
Za warudo!,Recommended
Hello Metroidvania my old friend!,Recommended
"Bloodstained was a fun ride.  Admittedly, it borrows a lot from its predecessor rather than innovates, but honestly I enjoyed the game anyways.  There's plenty to do and collect, and a decent number of secrets.  One thing that is annoying is that you can't adjust difficulty on your first playthrough, and by the end of a Normal playthrough you're a machine of death like most Castlevania games.  Overall though, I'd recommend it.  It's a nice return to basics, and I hope the creators are able to continue this series.",Recommended
"Beautifully crafted and a great company, 8/10. Only would be a 9 but the main story is only about 15 hours in the first play through. O ce all the free dlc comes out it may go up.",Recommended
"An amazing game, a great successor to Symphony of the Night and Aria of Sorrow, taking the best of both",Recommended
"Great revival of the Castlevania series, made by the Koji Igarashi from Symphony of the Night. Get it if you are a fan of the classics!",Recommended
Its really flippin cool,Recommended
"10 out of 10 game. Good graphic and great story. I liked this game because it reminds me of my childhood-like games, castlevania for example.",Recommended
"Even as someone who missed out on playing the classic Castlevania games, I was always drawn to the Metroidvania genre. So, when I saw this new game from the creator of the very games I missed out on, I was immediately pumped. \nAnd then the Kickstarter shot through the roof, and I was more pumped to know this game was gonna become what I hoped.\nAdmittedly, I was a little worried upon seeing the initial demo, but the fact that Iga and his team actually took the feedback and criticisms and IMPROVED the game, I knew I had to support them.\nAnd I was not wrong, if you liked Castlevania or the Metroidvania genre, do yourself a favor and play this game.\nPros:\n+Combat is pretty tight, fun, and can even be a bit challenging (like getting used to the backstepping mechanic and unlearning dodging from other games lol)\n+TONS of weapons to choose how you wanna play, though admittedly some are clearly better than others.\n+Big map, plenty to explore\n+Different difficulties to play through, and NG+ \n+Fully voiced, pretty good VAs too\n+3 different characters to (eventually) play as and 13 promised free DLC/content? Yes please.\nCons (Keep in mind, some of these are just personal):\n-Story is meh, pretty basic, but not awful\n-Can be a little grindy for crafting and upgrading (I don't really mind that, but some might)\n-Regular difficulty becomes a little easy early on, but does eventually becomes a decent challenge (Granted it might be only because I largely used guns after the 2nd or 3rd boss of my initial playthrough)\n-Guns might be broken 0.o\n\nOverall, it's a really fun game, maybe a bit short, only because I had so much fun playing it and couldn't stop, but has replayability and it's really just a big love letter from Iga to his fans, and I respect the hell out of it and hope it becomes a franchise.",Recommended
"After 4 years it's finally here!  Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night is a spiritual successor to Castlevania brought to life through Kickstarter and if you like side scrolling Metroidvania games, you'll most likely enjoy this one!",Recommended
"This is Castlevania in everything but name and that is a good thing,\n\ngreat art style, great Music and a fun game loop of exploring and grinding for Souls and Items to craft weapons",Recommended
If you don't buy this game it is bc you are a f***ing coward.,Recommended
"With the current trends of nostalgia-fueled spiritual successors releasing to a resounding fart, it's wonderfully shocking to see one actually release and be exactly what it claimed.\n\nIt's an Igavania in all ways, good and bad.\nNo front roll here, just back dash.\nSlow weapons? Swing before landing, swing, start backstep and swing again!\n\nEven has the soul collection system from the Sorrow duology.\n\nGet it if you like Igavanias!",Recommended
"An absolutely wonderful game! I was surprised to see there is good voice acting, there are a lot of weapons and skills/magic to pick from and it is really fun to be able to quickly change play styles. I was also VERY surprised to see a 2d game have some absolutely breathtaking scenes too. This game has overall exceeded my expectations and I would even recommend it at full price.",Recommended
"New players might find it clunky at start, but for long time fans of Castlevania Symphony of the Night and the other metroidvania games I'd say this is just right, same 2D scroller action reborn in a 2.5D dimension done just right (Unlike the 2.5D Megaman X games which were just plain awful).\n\nBeen playing this on my free time and I'm pretty satisfied with how Iga and team inserted easter eggs and familiar mechanics we'd love to see back and mixed from different metroidvania games. My only gripe is the goddamn dismantling needs some hardfarming and the crafting system is really grindy. Bad RNG = HARD GRIND even if you focus on luck stat.",Recommended
indeed,Recommended
Perfect clone of Castlevania: SoTN,Recommended
"If you're looking for a good metroidvania with a heavy Symphony of the Night vibe, look no further : this is the game you need.\nThe songtrack is amazing. and you can customize your Miriam. Blonde French Braid with green eyes, cute!",Recommended

"If you like SOTN, you'll probably like this.",Recommended
"Easily worth the 100$ i spent kickstarting it. a great metroidvania  from the guy who put the ""-vania"" in that portmanteau. a few small glitches here and there (such as; items that spawn in the walls gets forced out, but if it's only halfway into the walls, it'll stay there) but those are easy to ignore with how tight the gameplay is, how fitting the aesthetic, how glorious the soundtrack. can not sing it's praise enough!",Recommended
Pretty good Metroidvania so far! Looking forward to playing more!,Recommended

this game makes me horny,Not Recommended
Best Castlevania game ever! Good job IGA!,Recommended
I am writing this review because I need to write one for the steam summer sale. Good game tell your friends.,Recommended
"Even tho i pirated at first, i enjoyed like a lot and spend close to 2 day playing it non stop, i conclude it was more than worth  the pirce tag, at this point i don know wether or not the dlc was worth but still bought it, After the first run at 100% Completition im still enjoying it at 2nd.\nThis game is a excelent SotN tribute a long with the castlevania franchise as well.\n\n10/10 Would buy it twice",Recommended
"Great game, took me back to the first time I played Symphony of the Night. If you enjoy metrovania games in any way, this is a must buy.",Recommended
Looks fun... but very buggy and broken for some people.  There is a game breaking issue when leaving the very first room in the game that causes a lock-up.  This prevents me and others affected by it from playing the game.  The devs have yet to even acknowledge this and several other bugs exist.  Refunded until fixed.,Not Recommended
"An excellent Castlevania Sotn-like game. Though the normal difficulty feels like ""American"" difficulty, hard is where the Recommended experience is with better enemy placements, new enemy patterns. Hell zangetsu actually doesent hold back when he fights you and he's an actual challenge if you don't know what you're doing",Recommended
Totally is a refreshment to Koji Igarashi's genius.,Recommended
buy this game only for steam xp. worth it,Recommended
"A modern Castlevania SOTN with tons of content for the price, if you are a fan of the genre, this is a must buy!",Recommended
"IGA is back and as good as ever. It needs a bit more polish, but otherwise a worthy successor the IGAvania legacy.",Recommended
"If you like Symphony of the Night or other Igavanias, this game is for you. IMO, it might be the best one. There are only a handful of areas that aren't great. Otherwise, this scratches that itch perfectly.",Recommended
"Great game from the designer of the original Castlevania games. This game borrows the same game mechanics and a lot of features and elements from those games. If you liked Symphony of the Night, this game will feel familiar in more ways then you might initially expect.\n\nExploration through a 2D platforming style gameplay, with 3D graphics. Yet the game still hold Recommended to the old sprite style from the old game(s) in feel and gameplay. \nThe Map is pretty big, and the game features several endings. First play through and bad ending took me about 8 hours. To fully beat the game, about 25.\n\nMy main gripe with the game, is that I'm not very impressed with most of the bosses. Most of them are more to see if you have enough food for healing and can dish out enough damage fast in a slug fest, rather then a tactical challenge of finding out the patterns. And beating them with skill. \nSome of the means to progress through the game, at times a bit of a pain to find. with few, or no clues. And has you back track to find every little bit of the map to see if you forgot some little speck on the map, that might hold what you are looking for.\n\nThe shard system is pretty interesting, yet I found myself hanging on to just a few go to abilities throughout most of the game. Save for some situations where certain shards granting abilities that are required for progress.  \n\nThe plot is rather thin, which that is pretty much on par with other Castlevaina games.But did not expecting there to be much story to the game.\nThe acting too can be quite painful to sit through and you'd likely only sit through once, before you'd skip it any chance you get. \n\nPros.\n+Excellent retro style gameplay.\n+Graphics are good though at times look a little low res, on textures.\n+Decent length.\n+Shard system provides tons of customization upgrades and powers.\n+Great atmospheric Music. On par with SotN.\n\nCons.\n-Most Boss battles are somewhat underwhelming.\n-Story plot, and voices, are pretty shallow and underwhelming. (But that, to me, was no surprise.)\n\n---------------\nIs it as great of SotN.... I my opinion, its not. The boss battles does let it down a bit, and Alucard was just such a perfect fit for the game. Compared to this rather, emo, crystal tattoo'ed Miriam chick. Non-the-less, a GREAT and fun game. And surely one to get if you enjoyed Castlevania games before.Where I would (and will) Still go back and play SotN, even if its been about 20 years. I will likely only come back for the DLC to play this game for the additional content, before setting it aside.",Recommended
"if you like games like SOTN this game is for you buddy, don't hesitate in buy this amazing game !\n\n10/10",Recommended
Buy it.,Recommended
"Awesome successor to Castlevania: Symphony of the Night and many of the GBA igavanias.\n\nPros:\n-Great variety of weapons to cater to a number of playstyles.\n-While there's some issues of balance among shards, most are strong or versatile enough to warrant use.\n-Passive shards being upgradeable into Recommended passive is interesting, though super grindy.\n-Soundtrack is awesome.\n\nMixed:\n-Grindy nature of sharps kind of makes the entire game a choose-your-own difficulty sort of arrangement. Some people will like that, some won't.\n-Not a huge fan of 2.5D, would have preferred hand-drawn or sprites but it's not a deal breaker.\n-Whips have a weird hitbox. Pretty certain they have a deadzone near Miriam that they can't hit, which makes using them feel really bad. Unsure if this was an oversight or intentional.\n\nCon:\n-A big deal is made about the corruption of the shards early on that is only really explained at literally the very end of the game. I'm unsure if this is something that was supposed to be more fleshed out that they just cut or if it was always supposed to be this way. But this is overall small potatoes.",Recommended
"Played the game through its entirety up to 50 hrs playtime currently on my PS4 and still going back for more. Needs a bit more polish here and there but its every bit of what we were promised and more. Love the music, love the level design and castle breakdown, love the crazy amount of load outs you can make with all the differing abilities and love leveling up new ones to try out and see just how quickly i can tear through the bosses in this game. Outside of some frame slow down in certain areas and uneven load times between screen transitions teh game is amazing and highly recommended. All of its current problems dont get int the way of game completion and can be hammered out and refined in a patch for better optimization. If you dig SotN, Metroidvania, Igavania whatever the hell you want to call it pick this game up! You won't regret it!",Recommended

"Honestly? The only thing keeping this from my top of the list IGAvania choice is the fact that it isn't multiplayer like Harmony of Despair, which was gimmicky at best. This is a fantastic entry into the genre.",Recommended
Isn't just better than nothing/10,Recommended
"If you like Castlevania you'll like this game. The art style and cutscenes aren't great, but the gameplay is solid",Recommended
This is basically a new entry in the Castlevania series pre-Lords of Shadow but post Symphony of the Night.\nIf that doesn't sell you on the game then I don't know what to say.,Recommended

"Probably the best Metroidvania as far as the direct successors of the genre go.\n\nA fair amount of content, with the promise of more on the horizon. A lot of replay value, but for my money I'm going to wait for the extra characters before I fire it up some more beyond me just collecting stuff for 100 percent.\n\nPositives:\n+Usually good looking, except for some characters. The guy you are always around has a really ugly face texture, the way the light catches it makes him look dirty, but otherwise the use of colour and shadow is pretty fantastic. If anything is added I would like a proper camera zoom control for screenshots and maybe a couple new poses\n\n+Nested Easter Eggs - I found an Easter Egg and there was another Easter Egg within that one. This is the level of fanservice we're working at here. \n\n+Techniques for weapons make even garbage weapons fairly viable - I don't think I've ever felt the need to use the shortswords and daggers in a castlevania game but now they're actually useful.\n\n+Better difficulty curve than its predecessors - barring an admittedly cheesy soul I got early on that is a fairly rare drop, the enemies in this game put up a fight way more than any metroidvania. My biggest gripe with metroidvania is they never seemed to have the slightest clue how to balance difficulty so it was either ""run through the game and try not to fall asleep"" or ""turn to hard mode and have literally everything kill you in one hit"" with no in between. The addition of weapons with parries might even fix the latter, but if you're the kind of person that LIKES that they still have nightmare mode.\n\nNegatives? Or more Mehs?\n\n- A couple of the puzzles rely on completely arbitrary map finds to complete the campaign, arbitrary to the point where after I got through I had to reference a guide to make sure I did everything the intended way. I would prefer if these items were framed as key items because you have so many souls and items it is nearly impossible to keep track of any special powers or equipment you do or don't have at any given time.\n\n- There are some really late game moves I don't think are fully taken advantage of in puzzles. Ones that are used in like two rooms and that's it. If they're adding maps I would like to see trial areas similar to Order of Ecclesia that allow you to take full advantage of your arsenal.\n\n- Somebody please do something about Johannes' face I'm tired of looking at it.\n\n\n",Recommended
"This is literally everything I wanted since the middle of high school with this kickstarter. Honestly if you're really huge on Metroidvanias, this right here is made by the granddaddy of that genre.\n\nCastlevania fan too? Yeah this is literally Symphony of the Night revisited for me. I feel like a kid again playing this, it's so freakin' amazing.",Recommended
Amazing,Recommended
The modern Symphony of the Night that fans have been looking for. A must have if you're a fan of the SotN style Castlevanias.,Recommended
pretty good,Recommended
"SoTN with Aria of Sorrow mechanics, if you liked SoTN and Aria of Sorrow then you'll like Bloodstained: Ritual Of The Night.",Recommended
Basically a successor to SotN era of Castlevanias. It takes a bit to get used to the 2.5D but other than that I is Fantastic.\n,Recommended
Bunny girl suit.,Recommended
If you like Metroidvania type games then this is the game for you. It does so many things right that you're never annoyed by the game.\n\nGame can be a bit too easy if you happen to get some of the more OP spells.,Recommended
SOTN 2.0 go play it.,Recommended
"Great game, though some of the puzzles are rather lacking in hints. Finding the aegis armor, the random chance to find the water jet shard, the moon in the Gebel fight, all could really do with a little more explanation.\n\nThe crafting system is nice, but some items needed for it are too rare, while the common items are in ridiculous amounts. Halite is in half a dozen recipes and you either have to farm the galleon a ton or buy a bunch from the store. The cap on quantity for some things like potions can hurt as well. It takes 4 potions to make a high potion and you can only hold 9 at once, so you can only make 2 high potions before you have to make more regular potions.\n\nThe technique system is fun, but some are pretty situational and you might not have a chance to use them regularly.\n\nAll in all I'd say the game is a solid 8.5 out of 10.",Recommended
Finally a worthy successor to Castlevania Symphony of the night. Unlike most kickstarter projects like mighty no. 9 this one actually delivers what they set out to do. And we 13 free dlcs incoming you will have much more to look forward too.,Recommended
Solid metroidvania.,Recommended
"If you are looking for a Metroidvania from the man who brought us Castlevania than look no further. Koji Igarashi's has delivered what I would consider one of the best Metroidvania games to date with Bloodstained. The story is really the only thing that I would say is really lacking but it is made up for with tight gameplay, great music, and wonderful atmosphere that makes it feel like I am playing Symphony of the Night for the first time again. \n\n9.5/10 Would Recommend",Recommended
"I backed this game on Kickstarter since I loved Metroidvania games. Years later the game is finally here and it's one of the better games I've kickstarted. It's nice to see Iga make a larger game with a bigger budget compared to what he made at Konami. The game does have a few annoying quirks, like having certain perks (like not taking damage from spikes) being tied to certain items but overall the negatives don't outweigh the positives. If you love Metroidvania games you wont go wrong with picking up Bloodstained.",Recommended
It's more classic 2d Castlevania.  Somewhere between SOTN and the GBA titles.,Recommended

"Absolutely awesome game! I love all the nods it gives to Castlevania:SOTN, they are quite fun. Controls are really smooth, and the graphics are gorgeous.",Recommended
"Being someone who's never player Symphony of the Night to completion, this game was fairly enjoyable. I beat it in about three 8-10 hour sessions. Totalling around 25 hours of gametime. I love this game immensely, the amazing customization and different ways to fight with what has to be hundress of different powers to choose from.\n\nIf you like melee, there's a lot of melee weapons. There's also guns which I didn't utilize at all beyond the bit of messing around at first, but they have many different bullet types which I believe have different effects. \n\nOne minor downside I had when playing the game is there's no way, at least that I found, to upgrade your equipment. So while the trailers really emphasized character customizations, it's all locked behind equipment which for someone like me who prioritizes having high stats as opposed to the way something looks it's a bit disappointing that I can't upgrade the equipment when I can upgrade the powers. A hat with 5 defense will only ever have 5 defense. You can kind of upgrade some weapons that are crafted with the 8-bit coins by using the 16-bit and 32-bit coins to make them better. But only those weapons have that effect.\n\nThe story was nice, if a little hard to follow at times when it's just getting started. \n\nOverall, I think the game was a fun ride, and I am definitely gonna go into the New Game+ after a bit of a break.",Recommended
"the game is so awesome that you also can feel the spirit they put on the soundtrack, is like going back to PSONE and you're playing SoTN for the first time,  we need to appreciate the work of the dev, we need more games like this.",Recommended

Symphony of the Night's creator is back with the formula that made Castlevania great, but with original characters and story.

"Amazing game, loads of weapons and enemies, a whole bunch of free dlc is coming.\n\nIga - 1\n\nKonami - 0",Recommended
Great Castlevania-like with a few design issues which need polishing and a story that's rather rough. Aside from that it has tons of content with fun gameplay and kept me interested all the way through.,Recommended

A worthy successor to Castlevania,Recommended
A wonderful game with beautiful music and a charming design. I love every character I meet.,Recommended
"I kickstarted this game ultimately knowing what to expect.\n\nIf you're a fan of metroidvania styled games this is not going to be something revolutionary but is an excellent example of what to expect from the genre: an emphasis on exploration, various gothic style architecture, a plethora of collectibles, and a huge map to traverse. It has the markings of someone who has made games in the genre before, information readily available about the monsters via a bestiary, listed special attacks (once discovered) for the weapons, and various bits of lore to be found while exploring as well as multiple endings.\n\nI'm glad i backed it, this game turned out just as good as i expected it, and all without konami somehow making it worse than it could have been. I do hear the console ports have some minor issues making the PC version the superior version as well in my opinion so I hope you enjoy it!\n\nIf I had to summarize in a single sentence: This game is a mashup of Symphony of the Night and Aria of Sorrow's mechanics but slightly modernized making it an instant classic.",Recommended
"I was never into Castlevania or Metroid but I decided to give this game a try after seeing all the praise. No regrets. There is so much to do in this game beyond the Metroidvania formula of combat and backtracking. There are quests and other activities that you can do to gain gold, items, and achievements. There are tons of secrets to discover. There are tons of ways to craft your play style through items, weapons, armors, spells, passives, etc. The story is decent enough to keep you interested, but the gameplay and collection elements are what keep you hooked. Whenever you think this game can't introduce a cool new mechanic to the gameplay, you defeat a boss and get a new ability and it changes what you can do and how you explore. I highly recommend this platformer.",Recommended

Castlevania: Symphony of the Night 2\n\nThat is all you need.,Recommended
"With the poor track record of hyped games on Kickstarter, I remained skeptical the entire time the game was in production.  With how middling to poor games like Mighty No. 9 and Yooka-Laylee were, despite promising a return to form, I refused to let myself get my hopes up.\n\nBut I'm super happy to say that it was all for naught.  The game is fantastic.  It's a Metroidvania through and through.  The only difference between Bloostained and the games it was created after is that the properties of Konami were removed.  And while there are no Belmonts, Vampire Killers, or Dracula, it feels right at home with the series.  The mechanics of the game are actually very in line with Aria/Dawn of Sorrow, which are my favorites of the series.  And I'm actually really hoping that Bloodstained becomes a series that rehashes other mechanics, such as the tarot card system o Circle of the Moon.  There's a lot of content that could be moved over to the Bloodstained series, and that makes me hopeful and excited.\n\nIga, you did a great job.  Thank you for making it worth the wait.",Recommended
"Rough edges aside, this is exemplary of what should become of a successful crowdfunded game, and exemplary to all of its predecessors. Thank you, Iga and co.",Recommended
Love being overpowered and killing everything with one hit.,Recommended
"This title offers a game that's really only about the grind.   The story is decent, but nothing worth remembering in my opinion.   The graphics are beautiful for most areas, even the cool (spoilers: 8-bit area).   However there's some serious issues with the way there is no challenge on stages, then suddenly a near impossible boss, especially Zangetsu.  Sure it could be play styles and trying to have patience to find that right technique, and if that's the thing you like to spend hours on just to kill a boss, then this title is for you.    That said, I expect that level of difficulty to not be the default ""normal"" difficulty, and with other tiers locked behind beating the game, I have yet to test any harder mode to compare, so to me right now the game feels unbalanced.   I also don't care for the way they handle some puzzles to figure out with not even a clue to go by.   You basically just have to remember where chests are that you couldn't reach, and then hope by fluke you figure out (and remember where) to open those chests and that you coincidentally test the gear the minute you get it to see what it does and if it can help advance your game.   That's not intelligent game play, that's just pure laziness.   I not asking to have things handed to me on a compass, but solving a riddle here and there may have been more beneficial than leaving it at a superficial guess where odds are stacked against you until a google search answers that mind boggling query. \n\nFinally for a game I personally investing through kickstarter, it's disappointing how buggy it is, while I run high end gaming rig.   Loading times are fine, while most time the game runs smooth enough; there are times that randomly occur, (yes my cache gets emptied and checked constantly), where I would open the menu and the protagonist is headless and stuck at a loading screen even though you see the menu options, the only option I know to fix it is reboot the game.  This can be frustrating if you haven't saved for a while, especially during the later part of the map where save points may not be near soon enough to avoid that glitch and having to start over.   It also appears the further I get, the more it happens.  \n\nRegardless, so far if  I ignore the flaws, the game for the most part is exactly what was advertised in its backing.   It's Recommended visionary enchantment to IGA's earlier works and I look forward to see if the team will add to this universe not just through DLC but future titles as well.",Recommended
I love it.,Recommended

I think it's worth the price of entry because I love the genre. Others may not feel the same.\n",Recommended

Maybe ""hard mode"" would have been better, but it wasn't available at the beginning (you have to beat the game to unlock it).\n+ Fantastic variety of weapons and skills.",Recommended

Most of the time, creativity is how you spin an archetype. It's doing something cool, but with your own style.\n\nThis game does it Igarashi style, and it's a good look.",Recommended
It is a great game that re-captures the feeling of past Castlevania titles!\n\nI recommend!,Recommended
"Super primo iga game, You'll like if you've liked literally any other igavania game. It's a megamix of all previous game's mechanics.",Recommended
gud game i giv sotn/metroid is better,Recommended
"A game that does exactly what it set out to do; it's a Recommended-to-form metroidvania in the same vein as Symphony of the Night, albeit without the wonderful pixel art. It does however, have a wonderful soundtrack, some rather nice visuals regardless, and it trades in the campy voice actors of the past with a pretty strong cast in both English and Japanese, starring David Hayter (Solid Snake)  in English, and actors from a huge list of anime in Japanese.\n\nGameplay is exactly what you would expect. The questing system isn't perfect, but keeps you invested in searching for more materials. The music and visual aesthetic were the main draw for me, absolutely love the gothic castle with fancy vampires trope. \n\nThe only real complaint I have so far is the part where you have to speak to an NPC to trigger an event, when I figured out what I was supposed to do on my own. Overall, would recommend.",Recommended
Best gaem,Recommended
"This is everything I wanted in a Metroidvania game. While I love and have beaten every other Igavania titles many times, this is the one that scratches that Symphony of the Night itch best. It's a love letter to the genre, and does almost everything right. A few of the quest lines are a little obtuse, and there are a few difficulty spikes, but those are the only gripes I have with an otherwise amazing game. After fighting the final boss, I probably doubled my playtime just running around the game completing quests, and filling out the map. I enjoyed every second of it, and felt tremendously satisfied whenever I found one of the countless secrets and eastereggs. I wholeheartedly recommend this and look forward to the upcoming free DLC.",Recommended

The Castlevania ive been we have all been waiting for,Recommended
"uhhh, aria of sorrow 2?",Recommended
"A fantastic successor to the spirit of the Castlevania 2D games. Improvements and additions have been made to familiar elements: there is a wide variety of food items that restore health, and now also provide a permanent stat boost the first time you eat one. Along with uniquely styled weapons, there are also special moves unique to groups / classes of weapons. Special weapons take the form of shards, which can be refined to increase their effectiveness. NPC given quests, hidden power-ups and rooms, exploration and collecting are all present and satisfying.\n\nSo far, the most irritating problem has been that the game will freeze seemingly without cause, forcing me to restart the game. The game has no autosave feature and, while expected from a metroidvania, this does make the frequent crashes very frustrating. Given how well the game's developers responded to criticism and feedback during their development, I think it's safe to say this bug will be addressed.",Recommended

It's aight,Recommended
"I played A LOT of games in my life, never cared for achievements at all, but this game is the only one made me want to get all achievements, this is how I love it.",Recommended
"Throughout it's development, Bloodstained never looked like something that was going to end up being that good to me, I expected it to end up like another Mighty No.9.\n\nI'm glad to say that I was completely wrong, and I think it does a great job at capturing the feel of the Symphony of the Night style Castlevania games!\n\n It's just a fun game to play. There are a variety of powers and weapons to play around with and the RPG elements of the game I found to be enjoyable. One of the first games in a very long time that actually got me to smile.\n\nI do have some criticisms for it though. \n\n- The whips straight up feel like the weakest weapons in the game, and considering the legacy of Castlevania I had really hoped for the whips to be much better than they are.\n\n- There are also a handful of technical issues right now that I hope get fixed down the line, nothing that stopped me from completing the game but they were annoying at best and cost me in game progress at worst.\n\n- The ways to progress in the game can be quite difficult to figure out sometimes, and you cant replay the hints the characters give you for them. Often times you will find powers or items where you will have to deduce the right place to use them at.\n\nBut despite this, the game is still really fun and really scratches that itch for a good Castlevania game!",Recommended
"This is largely the same game as Castlevania: Symphony of the Night and the other so called [i]igavanias[/i] that followed it on GBA and NDS. Is it fun? Just like before, there's tons of stuff to collect and grind for. There's even an elaborate crafting system this time around so that you can grind even more. But the game is devoid of almost any challenge and the graphics are lacking. Still, I couldn't stop playing until I maxed out absolutely everything and got all the achievements.",Recommended

"Great game, can't wait for the new contents",Recommended
Yes.,Recommended
"Four years ago, Igi told Konami to stuff it and launched a crowdfunding project to make a new Castlevania game (if not by name) since Konami wouldn't let him.  Fast forward to today and he delivered exactly that.  Bloodstained is 100% a new Castlevania game, just without the name.  Some people criticize the game for being stuck in the past, but to them I say: Don't fix what isn't broken.  This game holds up just as well as modern metroidvania games, despite its design being rooted in the PS1 era.  It's nice to have variety, but Igi's particular style hasn't been seen in quite a long time, and it's refreshing to have it brought back.\n\nBloodstained has everything you need - a big map to explore, satisfying combat with a huge variety of weapons to use, a myriad of unique and strange enemies to fight, quirky music (from the original Symphony of the Night composer even!), appropriately cheesy voice acting, and a grand battle between good and evil.  Graphics, sounds, and animation are all solid (thankfully a last minute visual style change was a huge improvement) outside of some rather ugly rocks in underground areas.\n\nIf you're a fan of metroidvania games, don't miss this one.",Recommended
It's pretty much more SOTN. If you dig Castlevania then buy it,Recommended
"I backed this game back in 2015 and maaaan it was well worth the wait. If you're a fan of Castlevania Symphony of the Night or any other Igavania game, I highly recommend you get this!\n\nAll Hail IGA!!!",Recommended
"This game is not as good as Castlevania series, in particular, not as perfect as Symphony of the Night. The control and numerical design still certainly have rooms for fine-tuning and further improvement. \n\nYet, it is unfair to hold this game to the standard of Castlevania, as this is the first game IGA produced after his departure from Konami. He has to work with a new team, and the team has to work with a new engine, minor imperfection is unavoidable and totally understandable giving the circumstances. In fact, the degree of completion is quite satisfactory and I believe it goes beyond the expectation of most backers.\n\nSo overall, this game is not perfect, and I have my complaints about it. However, when it comes to the recommendation I couldn't say no. This game is a really good start and I'm looking forward to the future games in Bloodstained series. \n\nMake [strike]Castlevania[/strike] Bloodstained great again!\n\n",Recommended
"Good game,hope Iga will make another game like this",Recommended
"Combines all the good aspects from games like SotN, OoE, AoS, and DoS and replicate them in a new franchise(?). And when I say ""replicate"" I mean it. There is even a sorta clock tower (lots of spikes and ""medusas head floating around"".",Recommended

"Not too much to say. Did you like Symphony of the Night? Because it's Symphony of the Night 2. Exploration/finishing the game proper will take about 20ish hours but there's way more if you want to farm out all the weapons, shards, and other bits available.",Recommended
A masterpiece of the creator of the Metroidvania genre.,Recommended
What can I say that it's Koji Igarashi's Metroidavania without Konami. If you like Symphony of the Night you will love this. Even the graphics looks janky but the controls and gameplay are good.,Recommended
A fantastic game that comes from Kickstarter. The gameplay feels like a mix of Symphony of the Night (weapon and movement wise) and the Aria games (soul wise).

"Hello everyone,\n\nSo far, I can say Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night has been for the most part good.  Let me go over the good and bad in a few points:\n\n\nGood:\nReminds me a lot of Castlevania games from Symphony of the Night on up.\nAt least on the PC the game play on my computer has been smooth and enjoyable\nThe game is tough, but not so hard as to make me want to walk away.\n\nBad:\nThe game has points where I had no idea where to go.  I’ll give some examples later.\nA few things in the game aren’t documented that I can find, that would have been helpful to know beforehand.\nI keep having a bug where the game crashes.  I’m still playing around to see if the cause is with my system, or if it’s with the game.\n\nHaving said that if your looking for a single short answer:  Should I buy the game?    I would say that if you are a fan of the “Metroidvania” style game play, then I’d say buy it.  If you’re not sure, maybe wait for a steam sale, or otherwise when the game should be a little cheaper.  If you don’t like the “Metroidvanias” I’d say pass, and go for Bloodstained Curse of the Moon… as it is much more Castlevania in the NES style.\n\nNow I’ll say I think the positives and negatives are mostly self-evident, so let me get into some potential spoilers when talking about the problem with knowing where to go.  If you don’t want spoilers don’t read this section.\n\n[spoiler] When you get to certain parts of the game you are faced with seemingly no place to go.  Two in particular come to mind, the first one that immediately comes to mind is when you get to a spot in the towers.  It seems like you’ve come to a dead end because the only way to advance is though a set of spikes.  Well if you’re not positioned perfectly on the cog you will get thrown backwards and still take damage instead of proceeding forward and taking damage so that you can continue to advance. [/spoiler]  \n\n[spoiler] The other part is after you get the ability to bounce and clear the central part of the castle.  As it turned out there was a very precise jump that you had to make and at least for me it was at the absolute maximum you can jump.  Even the slightest bit off and you don’t make it.  I tried it several times before actually checking a walk though and finding out that yes, that’s where I needed to go the jump is that precise.  [/spoiler]\n\nFinally, there is a small issue that I wanted to mention.  The map has a way you can leave pins marking on the map.  However, the game doesn’t tell you about that not that I ever noticed anyway.  Instead I figured it out by accident finding that pressing B on my Xbox One controller hooked up to my PC that it left or removed a pin.  \n\nDespite these issues though if you like Metroidvanias, I suggest that you pick this one up.  If your questionable on them, I’d say try to get it on sale, and if you don’t like that style of gameplay but like the original Castlevania style game play then pick up Bloodstained: Curse of the Moon.\n",Recommended
"This might be one of the best ""Castlevania"" games I've ever played",Recommended
Well worth the wait.,Recommended
Fantastic game that plays like a greatest hits collection of all the 2D - 2.5D Castlevanias from Symphony of the Night onward. It combines mechanics from all of them in varying amounts and is fun to play. The games it shares most in common from are Symphony of the Night and Dawn of Sorrow. Definitely worth buying and will come with free DLC.,Recommended
10/10 - graphics\n10/10 - game play\n,Recommended
A great throwback to Symphony of the Night! Ridiculous melodramatic anime plot with stereotypical characters and corny dialogue. Over the top weapons and a plethora of broken spells and replay value! A great Gothic romp.,Recommended
A shorter version of Symphony of the Night. Expect a lot of grinding. Stupid 1% drop rates.,Recommended
An amalgamation of familiar mechanics and plot points that is worth your time and money,Recommended
Great game so far!,Recommended
kickstarted it and I'm really happy I did !,Recommended
Great combo of mechanics from SotN and the Sorrow Duo from Gameboy. If you loved those Castlevanias I highly recommend picking up this game. You'll get about 30hrs on normal difficulty to 100% the game on the one character currently available.,Recommended
7.2/10\nWorth checking out if you are an Castlevania fan.\nHas some questionable progression steps.\nWeird graphical direction (not the biggest fan of 2.5D personally)\nDecent music & overall acceptable gameplay.,Recommended
Totally not castlevania is fun,Recommended
So far so fucking good guys! If you love Igavanias then it IS back! Runs like a fucking dream in my case with all maxed out in 2K @120fps and loading times are just absent except when I boot the game! I am SO proud to have kickstarted this project! Yooka-Laylee was ok but this is the real deal bub!,Recommended
Castlestained...Bloodvania...? Whats the name of this game again?,Recommended
I'm interested in this.,Recommended
It's Aria/Dawn of Sorrow with elements from Order of Ecclesia. In no way a bad thing.,Recommended
"Fun game that accomplished what it set out to do in the kick-stater campaign. Lots of abilities and weapons to play around with. Has a lot of free content, easter eggs, modes, etc. If you're good at these types of games you might want to start on hard/nightmare for a better experience.",Recommended
"Good take on an old classic style. Not always direct in what you should do at some points, but it's good to not always have a game hold your hands and walk you through. There is something to be said about accidentally stumbling onto what you need to do.",Recommended
Great game lots of secrets and customization.,Recommended
"An amazing game though it has minor bugs, such as the glowing eye effect disappearing sometimes and in text boxes there is a chance that a word may not appear.",Recommended
Best SotN ever,Recommended
"Very fun game similar to SotN and a few of the newer castlevania games.\nLots of equipment and secrets to find along with fun and challenging bosses on difficulties above normal.\nThe story is quite simple but serves the game well. The voice acting in English is hammy but charming, and in Japanese it's a little better sounding but not amazing.\nIf you liked SotN or later Castlevania games that followed that style, check this one out.",Recommended
"This game is like an artifact. It's not a Metroidvania so much as it is a response to Castlevania: Symphony of the Night. It's built as though it doesn't know that Metroidvanias have made great strides in movement (Ori), combat (Dead Cells), or game flow (Hollow Knight). Its menus are as clunky, and its cut scenes as grueling, and its boss fights as rote as Symphony ever was. But in that loot-fetish, and running around a castle using your new powers on every cranny in search of a new opening, is the same kind of fun. Bloodstained is a darned good time because Symphony of the Night holds up.\n\nAs of this review, I'd recommend waiting a month or two to play it. There are numerous bugs, like the attacking buttons not causing you to attack, and loot getting stuck in the environment and not being available even though you can touch it, and attacks going right through enemies that should be vulnerable. These things can be patched. After some more polish, it'll be a very worthy entry in the genre.",Recommended
"The game isn't perfect as it has some minor glitches but the game is overall fantastic. You are in for a fun gameplay, things to do, great music, great revised design, and really entertaining boss fights. This game is worth your time. Makes me want to get a hold of Curse of the Moon. If you haven't, get it.",Recommended
This game brings back some good memories of the old school castlevanias and i love it,Recommended
"Take everything you could ever want from SotN and the GBA/DS Castlevania games, blend in some other classic RPG elements (quests, cooking, etc.), give it an insane amount of aesthetic/control polish, and what you end up with is Bloodstained. \n\nIt's an homage and a revitalization of a gaming genre that so very many of us have been hungering after for years.",Recommended
+1,Recommended
well\ngood enough\nas a fan of metroid vania,Recommended
Was hoping for more nudity.\n\nCan't win them all.,Recommended
"Great game, can't wait for more of the DLC",Recommended
"Definately worth the time it took to wait for it to be finished. I backed it at the begining and don't regret it at all. Yes, there are some things that need to be fixed for the switch version and there is a lot more to come.\n\nIf you like Castlevania Symphony of the Night this, to me felt very similar.",Recommended
"An amazing addition to the Metroidvania style of games.  Castlevania: Symphony of the Night fans will appreciate the nods to the game and Iga's masterful design making a comeback.  There have been bugs since launch, but I'm seeing the team combat them efficiently and work hard to squash them.  Two key bugs for now to look out for are:\n\n 1. Some items will clip when dropped, and since the pick-up radius is seemingly small, you can't seem to collect items often because they weren't dropped on a flat surface.\n\n2.  There are often times in water where you are unable to jump, which means that if there isn't a ramp in the body of water to swim towards and get out of the water, you'd need to use a waystone to teleport out, if you have one.\n\nI expect these bugs to be addressed soon, but they're the biggest ones I've personally encountered.",Recommended
Best Metroidvania I've ever played,Recommended
Everything I could have asked for in an Igavania/Metroidvania game.,Recommended
Symphony of the Night + Aria of Sorrow + Crystals + Steroids\n\nIt feels so good to play this game.\n\n- controls are nice\n- map is fun to explore\n- weapons are fun\n- power ups and skills are amazing\n\nCan't find anything to complain about this game,Recommended
"""People are not interested in Castlevania anymore"" -Konami\nWell, this game proves otherwise, oh and also it's such a great gem of a game.\nIt is a must have if you are a Metroidvania fan but even if not you might like it because the game is that good~",Recommended
Makes me regret not finishing Symphony of the Night.,Recommended
A combination of the best elements from all the Metroidvanias since SOTN. \n\nWarning: Contains DANK METAMORPHOSIS!,Recommended
Iga you've done it again!,Recommended
This game is just SOTN with a dash of dawn of sorrow. It's perfect.,Recommended
"[h1]Good game, but it needs to wipe the glitches of it's face first[/h1]\n\nBloodstained: Ritual of the Night is the answer for having something close to a Castlevania game and it does deliver, but it really needs to take care of those glitches because it's preventing me for scoring this game higher.  If anyone ever played Symphony of the Night, Aria of Sorrow, Dawn of Sorrow and Order of Ecclesia, then they'll feel right at home this game.  The mechanics are almost virtually identical from the games mentioned earlier, but made improvement and boy it shows.  As for in game's content, they have the basic boss rush, speed rush, new game plus, soon a new playable character and like Symphony of the Night, if you type in a certain name on a file, something cool will happen.  I strongly recommend people to check out the forums to see whether or not to buy this game yet because the glitches still exist, but if people have patient problems and want to take the risk, then by no means by it, but by it when it's on sale.  Personally, the game is very enjoyable as demonstrated with the amount of achievements I've earned, but I'll be honest here with one thing though, I like the music of the game, but I wish the music had more impact like Symphony of the Night since that game had such a powerful soundtrack.  So, once again the game is really good, but it needs to wipe those glitches of its face first before coming over somebody's home first.  Note:  The some of the glitches are game breaking, but they don't occur all of the time, but frequent, so if nobody minds this, then have at it and buy this game or wait - The choice is yours and yours alone.",Recommended
just buy it,Recommended
"Its Good, great even.",Recommended
I haven't enjoyed Symphony of the Night this much since I first played it on PS1.,Recommended
Nice,Recommended
I completely skipped the Kickstarter and just deliberately avoided getting hyped because I didn't think the game could possibly deliver on my Metroidvania nostalgia. I was pleasantly surprised to find that it totally did.,Recommended
"Very good game, never stopped being fun, despite feeling a bit too powerful too fast due to how upgrades work.",Recommended
"The best not-Castlevania game combining all the good stuffs from other Castlevania games. Difficulty is just right, not too easy, but challenging enough.",Recommended
"Waifus, Castlevania, and exciting moments of needing a specific item in one specific area that you'd never look because it's one of those games where if you don't use a guide to figure some things out you're a much bigger woman than I.",Recommended
Pretty much just the successor to Symphony of the Night that everyone wanted.,Recommended
"If you ever liked any Castlevainia game (ever), you can't go wrong with this. Except maybe losing sleep.  Love every second of this game!",Recommended

"Great game, has some serious SNES side scroll vibes. Lives up to the Metroidvania description along with plenty of customization and easter eggs. The only problem are a few infrequent crashes.",Recommended

"If you're into any Metroidvania/Igavania style game, this will not disappoint.",Recommended
"Great game for Metroidvania fans \nThe Good:\nEnemy variety,lots of weapons to choose, items to collect and a large map to explore.\nGreat soundtrack.\nThe Bad: \nFew bugs and crashes.\nMost bosses are too easy and the story weak.\n",Recommended
"I love Aria and Dawn of Sorrow, this takes those mechanics and takes them further.\n\nRelative to Sorrow: Grind is faster, customization is larger, abilities are more endgame-viable.\n\nYou're given a large arsenal of very strong tools so you may find Normal mode far too easy, even with the strongest items locked till the last boss area. Unfortunately the higher difficulties are locked until the previous is cleared, but that's my only gripe.",Recommended
"So far in I have enjoyed this game as I was a big fan of Aria of Sorrow back on the GBA. I am excited for the future updates and to see some of the minor bugs and things patched out, but as it stands the game is functional and incredibly fun in the metroidvania style. The visual style used is a plus for me too because I really like the stained glass/crystally style that they have going. Oh and if you get it don't forget to find the barber if you're looking to change your character's look up every now and then!",Recommended

This game has lived up to all my expectations, tons of things to find, lots of abilities/spells/weapons, and I actually cared about the story as well.

"100% game and all achievements in a little over 38 hours, which is quite a bit longer than the average metroidvania. Good bang for your buck",Recommended
Excellent metroivania greatly recommended,Recommended
"Despite any presentation issues this game is top notch. I'm surprised after all this time, and after all the metroidvania games to release, not many have come close to what a proper igavania brings on the RPG side. It's packed with depth and goes as deep as you're willing to go.",Recommended
"19xx whip = equipped \n\nRetro ring = equipped \n\nNostalgia Shard = equipped \n\nNow whip that candle and buy the damn game if you’re into symphony of the night, the mother of metroidvania games \n",Recommended
"Worth every penny. Brings all of the best aspects of the classic Castlevania's together in one game. Plenty of weapons, unique weapon techniques, lots of decent puzzles to keep you exploring and challenged with enough grind that you CAN grind if you want to, but if not, you can power through the game instead.\n\nWas very hesitant at the price tag, but in the end, zero regrets. I expect to have hundreds of hours in this game as I play on the harder and harder difficulties. The visual style is flawless; the game is smooth and gorgeous and the models for the enemies are well-crafted and well-executed. \n\n10 / 10 \n\nA paragon of the genre. You get what you pay for, so if you like platformers and Castlevania, then get off your wallet and buy this game.",Recommended
This is the best Castlevania simulator ever. Accept no substitute.,Recommended

It's incredibly satisfying content. And it's beautiful.\n\nIt completely surpassed the GBA and DS Castlevania games, but not SOTN since that's my favourite game of all time, so beating that would be very difficult, if not impossible.\n\nPlease give IGA your money, he deserves it.",Recommended

"It felt good to play this. Like replaying Symphony of the Night, but this game can stand on its own legs. The main game is kind of short, but if you're just trying to speed through the first time then you're doing it wrong.

dude. just buy it already lol.,Recommended
Feels like SotN ands its great!,Recommended
better then SOTN !!,Recommended
"If you like SotN, you'll enjoy this game just as much.",Recommended
"Not as good as Curse of the Moon, but I like it. Pretty fun for fans of Symphony of the Night and other late Castlevania games, but a bit messy compared to more straightforward Metroid-likes (lots of unnecessary half-baked leveling and crafting systems that can get annoying).",Recommended
"Easily one of my new favorite games. It reminds me a lot of Aria of Sorrow, which is one of my top games and although I don't think it's worth the steep price tag, I would advise picking it up if you're a fan of castlevania or metroidvania styled games",Recommended
"An amazing return to the SNES Symphony of the Night style Metroidvania experience!\n\nThe story: simple, to the point and effective.\n\nThe Music: Great, not amazing, but does help bring you back to the nostalgia.\n\nThe Crafting: Fun! Very fun! I have never felt more inclined to hunt for materials from monsters than ever before in this game. You can easily spend hours getting the materials for some of the best weapons, gear, recipes in the game, and it still feels worth it and makes you feel accomplished once you've done so.\n\nThe Gameplay: This is by far a great and absolute driver for the game. With a massive variety of weapon, shards both active and passive, it gives you quite a plethora of opportunity to build out a style you prefer and like! Additionally, the number of little secret hidden gems around the entire game are definitely fun. From secrets buried in the walls, or the floors not ""actually"" being floors, you  have so many different things to do and explore and find.\n\nThe Bad: As much as I greatly enjoyed this game, I did wish the story felt a little more ""story"". But that's a small gripe compared to one major flaw. I found that it was supremely easy to kill most all the bosses with one simple spam skill (Summon flying pigs). You spam this to your heart's content and all enemies are toast! It did give me an incredible opportunity to cheese through most of the map, but I refrained and tried to pick some more fun and tactical abilities instead. Also, utilizing status buff shards seemed a little pointless as I never felt so overwhelmed in combat that I couldn't slash my way through and had to utilize debuffs to help.\n\nThe Verdict: Well worth the cost of entry for those that bought into the KS. I think its a fun game, and you can easily get you money's worth. It clears that Metroidvania itch, but I do wish that there was an option to turn the map into a more rogue-like setting so that it was randomized and made it unique enough to make me what to replay the game. There are new game modes unlocked at different points, however, I don't really feel compelled to do so now that I've felt like I accomplished all the main hidden goodies already.",Recommended

"This game brought me back to the days of good old Igavania games on the PS1 and Nintendo DS. I was skeptic at first since the first trailers didn't show much promise, but what we have now is a highly polished, extremely responsive, and truly immersive Metroidvania game. I had a blast switching shards to test which ones I like best (Heretical Grinder and Welcome Company master race). I also spent some time on side quests like cooking and even farmed demons for the recipes though I admit this was a bit of a drag. What surprised me the most was the fact that the voice actors of Solid Snake/Big Boss and Alucard were here! Coolness factor set to 11 :) \n\nAlthough the game brought joy to my tiresome work-home life, I was a little frustrated with how unapparent some of the paths are (take note of the word some). While I fully understand that this is part of the game's charm, it was just a tad hard to figure out unless you really pay close attention. If I only had ten dollars every time I would say ""REALLY?"" in this game, I would be rich by now.",Recommended
Thank you IGA,Recommended
"How I divide games up is by community and the game itself. \n\nMy little background is I played and love Castlevania series (2d ones at least). However, i literally will rip apart a game see the game purely by mechanics. ie: what is the purpose of this item, is hard mode really hard? Every great game has flaws there is no such thing as a perfect game. \n\nBloodstained Goods\n- Provides a decent Castlevania experience for the price (maybe it is worth a little more). Either way for 40$ (original price) it is definitely worth it compared to 60$ games. \n- Game will provide you ~ 8 - 10 hours and maybe a little 1 or 2 if you are a completionist (which I'm not)\n- You can play this game with whichever weapon (play-style) you want.\n- Backer's promises were kept\n\nBloodstained Bads\n- music here is essentially forgettable. So much violin to a point where you can barely remember oh this is a different song\n- this game is HEAVY and i mean very HEAVY on fan base.\n     - you can change Miriam's appearance to anything you want really\n     - a lot of rooms dedicated to donors ( so if this game is 2x bigger than SOTN as advertise do these ""shrine room"" count as a \n       room?)\n     - a lot of references to castlevania games (boss, secrets, etc.)\n- difficulty progression in this game is out of order, but as you progress with the game it gets more manageable if not easy\n     - the main reason why is boss # 2. Boss # 2 is way too agressive so early on in the game. This one is really up to debate, but \n       for my personally Boss # 2 shouldn't be there maybe move to around boss # 5 slot then it be manageable. Sure #2 teaches \n       you new mechanics, but you will not encounter any enemy that does something similar until ~1 later. So why is he there?\n- weapon techniques are pretty much useless. People try very hard to defend this, but in the end it doesn't do anything besides eat your mp. For example, I use a long sword and my default attack does 40, now i can do a windup attack that does 60 with weapon techniques. Your default attack is faster costs no mp and you magic does more damage than your weapon can do. People go on say "" weapon technique offers you a new attack range"" That would be good only in a 3d space. In a 2d space, your attack arc whether going overheard or golfswing (a great sword does this) it is not different enough to make is worth using.\n- weapons do not differ from each other that much due to techniques offering nothing different for you so they feel the same. Shoe, dagger, rapier all feel the same since they basically a stab motion.\n- Presentation look passable. \n        - Miriam's model clip into herself, sometimes her hair move at a different frame than everything else\n        - There are some cinematics things like grab attack, knock back, or even cutscenes that look like a college project/\n- Story here is unfortunately generic, with plot twists that are weak.\n- Hints on how to progress are in dialogue and presented in a good way its just not acessible.\n        1. you have to run into a problem\n        2. Purchase something, sell or whatever\n        3. Hint is revealed through banter\n        4. why not add a talk button? ( portrait of ruin)\n        5. also the hint won't be repeated if you missed it. this should have be in archieve.\n\nOverall this game I would give it an 8/10. Even though there is lots of flaws many are just minor and have to deal with execution and presentation. I don't like to refer to SOTN because it shows bias, but its the only good example where music vary drastically from place to place ( bloodstain is violin and violin and violin. change it up!) However, the entire game itself is very good it has something working for it. If dracula is reading this, I recommend just touching up on the technical parts (talk button, better animation) if you make another castlevania.\n\n\n",Recommended
If you think this game is only for fans of the Castlevania series you'd be wrong as I have never touched a Castlevania game before but I love this game and would highly recommend to old and new fans alike.,Recommended

"From the perspective of someone who has never played a Castlevania game; I quite like this game.\n\nIt has a variety of weapons to suit your play style, the bosses are diverse, and there's a bunch of gear and customisation to increase your stats to suit your needs.\n\nThroughout the game you collect Shards from enemies. The Shards give you new abilities to use. There are A LOT of Shards to collect and upgrade. There are also a bunch of weapon combos to discover that give you abilities.",Recommended

Konami may have released an anniversary collection recently, but this is the superior product. A beautiful game with plenty to explore, learn, collect and master! Took me over a week on constant play to beat, but I don't regret one minute of it. On my second playthrough as we speak and I'll play even more once the rest of the DLC comes out.

"This is the best cooking simulator I've ever played.\nIt has some side game play where you need to go and hunt demons for ingredients.\nBut the main game play happens once you scavenge the castle chests for those pesky recipes and key ingredients, you get to use the intricate alchemy interface to make the recipes, honestly it's super fun.\nAlso there is this one old lady customer who is my best patron. She always says my food is delicious, she scoffs the whole lot and doesn't leave a single crumb for me, on the bright side she says my cooking makes her feel better.\nThere is even a self gratification system in the stats, where you get bonuses for eating your own food dishes.\n\nWould recommend this cooking game, 10/10.",Recommended

"I installed the game last Friday after work and played almost thirty-two hours over the weekend. I was so focused on it I did not realize that I had a bad case of poison ivy until my wife came home. The game is a bloody good SotN grandchild. I do miss the ability to dual wield or have a shield and weapon, though. It has a shield weapon that you can craft with an ""8-bit coin"", but that acts as a short range shield bash and will guard/parry for a couple of seconds afterwards if the attack button is held. Limited use and not really worth it, IMHO. Maybe in the harder modes where you can't take as much of a beating. A better use for the coin would be the Encrypted Orchid, which looks and sounds like a trademarked laser-ish sword Mace Windu would use. Right now I am using a flying sword that acts as a boomerang. It is weaker than some of the others I currently have, but can get a few hits per flight and has range. I hope there are more hidden weapons like those further in the game.\n\nI did have one game freeze in that time, so I can see how some people can say it has issues. I was disappointed that it did not support my wide screen monitor size, but it is definitely not a standard size at 3440 x 1440. I had to play at full HD windowed. It mostly ran pretty smoothly, except at one of the bosses.\n\nI haven't finished it yet; darn things like work and life and illness get in the way sometimes. I am twitching to do so, though.",Recommended

"I’m sure there’s more than what I put here, but a short disclaimer. This has been the first time in a very long time that I got this into a game. It was a very good experience and I am looking forward to the additional DLC and Zangetu mode. Well worth a play if you are into side-scrollers. I mention it below, but I’d suggest either hard or (my personal preference) nightmare mode to start on a new game, as opposed to normal. Lose out on a lot of the experience IMO.\n\nPros\n-The game is a passion project and comes across that way. Feels very SotN.\n-Map/Monster Placement\n-Good story writing and character expression.\n-Characters (including the main) feel real to what is being portrayed in the narrative. \n-Difficulty modes selectable from start. (Albeit with a name code, NIGHTMARE.)\n-Normal Difficulty: Great for casual fans. Not difficult and allows exploration easily. You can level up.\n-Nightmare Difficulty: IMO, the perfect difficulty. (Non-NG+) Although the tutorial stage is rough. \n[spoiler](Save the 3x potions for the boss. Vepar is really difficult on this mode unless NG+.)[/spoiler]\n-Bosses feel unique. Plus shiny medals for beating them without taking damage. \n[spoiler]There are several secret bosses as well. Though only 2 of them give medals.[/spoiler]\n-Lots of secrets to find. (A con on this later.)\n-Weapon/Crafting diversity.\n-Great spell diversity.\n-Familiar diversity. Some could use A.I. tweaks, but I used most of them for X situation.\n-Grinding for shards isn’t necessary to beat the game, but it is available to those who enjoy it.\n [spoiler]Blue chests which respawn in the areas upon area reload exist which give out the corresponding crafting material for the point in story progression. This reduces grind time by a large amount. The game tells the player this as well, which means it was meant to be noticed.[/spoiler]\n\nCons\n-Difficulty select by name code. Better to have a menu.\n-On secrets mention from above: [spoiler]The world is /very/ linear. There were maybe 2 points when multiple bosses could be taken in differing order. It wasn’t substantial either. As well, there were a couple spots that felt like a very forced kind of linear.[/spoiler]\n-[spoiler]2 bad endings end with “game over”, which is unfortunate, because it clues the player in that they missed something. Far, far more rewarding to omit “game over” and let them think it is the real ending. Upon finding out there is other endings, there is a shock moment.[/spoiler]\n-Techniques don’t feel great to use.\n-Occasional input drops, particularly on jumping. Rare, but happens enough to note.\n-[spoiler]Elemental enemies are annoying. I get why they break terrain, but better pathing would do them well. Making them go off-screen, which makes them unhittable, is tedious. By off-screen, I do not refer to further on in a given area. I am talking beyond the edges of the map.[/spoiler]\n-Map Exploration: [spoiler]Unfortunately only goes up to 100%. I was hoping for a break the map for more or an inversion to explore. Though DLC was mentioned, so perhaps with time. One hopes![/spoiler]\n\nNeutral\n-Power Progression: [spoiler]This is more of a personal critique. With 100% clear, the character is /very/ powerful. NG+ going into hard or nightmare feel very easy by comparison to starting at a new game. Especially with accelerate and a certain wind slashing weapon. I think removing the name code for difficulty would really fix this some. People would have to go out of their way to get the experience of a new game (no +) and be willing to forego all the work/grinding they may have done in their previous game to start up a new save.[/spoiler]",Recommended

Iga-San has done it once again.",Recommended
"Fantastic. I can imagine the Kickstarter backers are actually happy with how this project turned out for a change. Great visuals, great design, amazing soundtrack. It’s just a ton of fun to go and explore the castle and the surrounding areas, finding secrets and hidden rooms – good stuff! \n\nThere’s a lot to collect too and a fair amount of replay-ability.\n\nMy only concern would be the story, as there really isn’t much to it, or to the characters outside of their very nice designs. But that’s fine, that’s not the point of the game. Run, jump and slash at demons. That’s all you have worry about. And the game excels at this.\n\nDon’t worry about what might seem a high price point. The game is undoubtedly worth it.\n\nI recommend wholeheartedly.     \n",Recommended

"It's great apart from one aspect: it's horrible at directing the player to where they should go next, even relative to other metroidvanias, and even if you've been placing map markers to keep track of everything. There's a very high chance you'll need to look up where you need to go/do multiple times, or else you'll waste [b]many[/b] hours. You'll repeatedly get next to nothing for hints[i](or literally nothing)[/i] in the second half of the game[i](when you've already explored everything you have access to)[/i], or the one hint will be so vague that you'll have to explore everywhere anyway. Most of the game is spent wandering aimlessly through hundreds of rooms you've already explored, and for completionists, killing each enemy in the game 100-200 times in one of the worst grinds ever in an attempt to complete the archives[i](tracks completion for items, quests, collectables and more)[/i].\nIt gets obnoxious for completionists, but it's worth it.

"Held off on this game for a little bit because of the reviews that said it felt unfinished or it had a lot of bugs/crashes. Only issues I've had is the music was lowering and raising the volume on its own (a restart fixed it) and I fell into water but was unable to jump out like you normally can. Suspending the state (exit save) and reloading fixed that too. If you liked SOTN, just buy this game now. It's definitely worth it.

"Bloodstained is everything I wanted when I backed this game on kickstarter four years ago. I was in the middle of replaying the GBA and DS Castlevania games when I heard about it, and I immediately backed at the $60 tier. The controls feel nearly identical to AoS and SoTN, and some of the areas feel more like a remaster than a spiritual successor. There isn't much *new* here though. The shard mechanic is nearly identical to Aria of Sorrow's soul mechanic, the crafting is an extra step in getting better equipment, and the 2.5D aesthetic... is acceptable. I didn't want anything new from the game though, and I'm beyond satisfied with what I got.",Recommended

"Bloodstained is an excellent metroidvania in the vein of Symphony Of The Night and the GBA/DS Castlevanias that followed that genre mold.\n\nThe puzzles may feel a little obtuse at times, but the few worst cases actually have in-game hints obtained by talking to NPCs or are foreshadowed in some fashion before (so pay attention to what the dialogs say instead of skipping through the cutscenes!).\n\nThe gameplay is slick, seriously PACKED with features based on (and expanded from) those found in the Castlevanias I've mentioned, the soundtrack is Michiru Yamane's usual excellence and the plot... well, it does have its' moments even if it's quite formulaic.\n\nBuy it, play it, you won't regret it.\n\nPS. I CAN'T STOP PLAYING. SEND HELP.",Recommended
GOOD,Recommended
"Positives \nAfter three long years of waiting we finally got this game i am so glad i backed this game all that time ago, and honestly the wait was 100% worth it to finally play a Castlevania game without it being a Castlevania game, the game looks and feels extremely beautiful, the music is pretty much perfect, lots to do and find several being nods and easter eggs to Castlevania itself many different play styles and many unique spells plus some weapons that returned/weren't in many Castlevania gameslike the crissaegrim and vorpal blade all be it with different names , the voice acting was great, and once you have all the movement abilities it is so much fun retracting steps to find hidden goodies\nNegatives\nMostly a few bugs here and there like some times when you kill an enemy if they are in geometry chance are their item bags will be in the wall unable to be gotten or if they are you have to walk into a random part of the room\nEvery now and again there would also be slowdown \nThe game is also fairly linear but that's not necessarily a bad thing some metroidvanias can be too open at times which can be a deterant i.e SONT and it's two castles \nAlso i can't believe the jumpscare got me XD\n10/10 would 100% again",Recommended

Great Game tons of fun took me about 25 to do one playthrough with minimal grinding and getting just about everything explored!

You can tell this was a passion project for the team and it shows wonderfully. I'm thankful for the backers and helped make this game possible and for the team that created it.

If you have the money to spare then check this game out for sure because I know it may seem pricey but we really need to show love to the people that make games for the players and not for their own pockets.  If you want a harder experience for your first run enter your name as NIGHTMARE to unlock hard and nightmare mode. I played about 50% of the game on normal before I found this out.

"Having just beat the base game I can definitely say this is worth the money if you are a fan of the genre, or maybe even if you aren't. It follows the usual trend of being enough like SotN to give you nostalgia while also being different enough to feel like a completely different game. The English voice acting can be comically bad as per SotN standards, and that's entirely expected. There are still some minor bugs in the game (such as items getting stuck in walls or getting glitched in water), but they aren't game breaking and will hopefully be patched later. I would definitely recommend this game.",Recommended

" Very good game. I don't regret paying the full price, even though it is quite expensive. \n Had no issues running it on my laptop. Game works well on the highest settings without any need of configuring anything. Wired Xbox one controller gave no issues too. \n The game is a lot like Castlevania titles such as Symphony of The Night, Aria of sorrow, etc...\n As expected, the music is excellent and fits the visuals well. The voice acting is surprisngly good too! I expected some awkwardness with David Hayter being somewhat of a meme, but there wasn't any.   \n Story is slightly better than your usual Castlevania game, but I don't play these games for the story.  \n Gameplay is similar to the nostalgic castlevania titles. Just what you'd expect. I don't mind any of the grindiness, because it gives me a reason to linger around in an area and enjoy the music. I think that most negative reviews about the gameplay come from people who don't like Castlevania games or have never played them. Their quirkiness of these games is what makes them unique.\n The only thing I dislike about it is that it does have some bugs. The bugs aren't really that gamebreaking. They're usually things like hair and scarves clipping through Miriam's body, and in the more annoying case being unable to pick up items that have dropped on slopes or got stuck in the walls. Kind of irritating if you're trying to farm that one drop.\n I recommend this game, but it would be wise to wait until the more annoying bugs are ironed out, or the price lowered. If you like Castlevania games, you should get it for sure.",Recommended

"Castlevania: Symphony of the Night 2 is a very good game.  The combat is fun, the shards give you a lot of options, I enjoy the art style, and it's got a nice amount of the Metroidvania goodness. Not a huge amount, since my biggest complaint would have to be that the game is on the short side for its genre, but a nice amount nonetheless. Story's nothing special, but it's not like you cared about that anyway. The exploration and combat loop is quite engaging, however there were a couple points where the path forward was... less clear than it should be. Having to talk to the vampire who is entirely unrelated to the train multiple times in order to get a train pass or having to grind regular enemies to get an ability essential for progression were not high points. But they were the exception. \n\nHonestly the biggest problem with this game is that unlike the first Castlevania: Symphony of the Night, this game came out in a world where Hollow Knight exists. And this game is no Hollow Knight. But it's still a good time. You may want to wait for a sale, though. $40 is a bit steep for what's here, but not by much. Basically if this was a game you were looking forward to, or a game you think you'd like, then it's a game you're going to like.",Recommended

"Kickstarter backer here! This game definitely scratched the Metroidvania itch and was worth the wait! I hope other game developers see this as a wake up call that this genre is still very much alive. \n\nArtwork was good 9/10, the default settings made the game a little too bright which was a fix I suppose after people complained about it being too dark. I recommended adjusting the brightness and toning it down a little bit. \n\nVoice acting/dubbing 7/10. I did appreciate David Hayter doing voice work in the game and look forward to playing as Samurai Snake. The other voices didn't do much for me really, and there was some syncing issues I noticed. Nothing game ruining though.\n\nGameplay 9/10. It's a big map to play around in and there's things to remember to come back later for. One gripe I have is the green chests should be marked on the map similar to the blue chests. Speaking of maps, you get one map in the beginning and that's kind of the end of that..\n\nMusic 8/10. It was decent, but didn't really rope me in to the gameplay. Didn't really feel like anything memorable. \n\nSome other things:\nA little buggy, again, nothing game breaking. A lot of enemies when you kill them near a wall, the loot they drop gets stuck and can't be picked up for 5-10 seconds. Some lights you break will drop the money through the floor.\n\nThe cameos were really nice, really had a SOTN feel in some aspects. What with OD and the homage to the librarian, including the secret jump. \n\nBosses were pretty fun and unique, but not very challenging I felt. \n\nOverall, I still would give it a 9/10 and would buy it again if given the opportunity. \n\n",Recommended
"Yes! Yes!! YES!! Sweet, fancy, freewheeling Moses, it's FINALLY here and it's COMPLETELY rad!\n\nOkay. So. I backed this game about a month after it was announced. I am a complete Castlevania dork (it, DOOM, and RE are probably my three top franchises, honestly, which, since RE2Make was amazing, and this is great, if DOOM: Eternal is awesome, 2019 may be cemented as one of my best years for games, even if EVERYTHING ELSE IS ON FIRE HERE IN AMERICA. I'll try to remember the good times). I started with Dracula's Curse (rather late) at the feet of my brother when I was like eight, and discovered Symphony at something like 12. Whether my obsessive, full-frontal nerdity for the series, and the fact that I funded the game makes me MORE or LESS of a trustworthy critical source is for you to decide. So. Ya know. Full disclosure up front.\n\nANYWAY.\n\nThis game is sick as fuck. I absolutely adore it. It plays precisely like Symphony, with very heavy focus on attributes from Chronicles of Sorrow and a heaping dash of Order of Ecclesia and Portrait of Ruin. Symphony gives us basic interaction, movement, combat (although weapons like the Greatswords and the animations thereof are STRAIGHT out of Aria/Dawn), etc. We get Portrait's  inputs for special techniques (like spells from Symphony, only a lot more useful, if you ask me) for different weapon classes. From order we mainly get some character interactions and the difficulty. I have no problem saying this is definitely one of the harder Igavanias. Symphony, Aria, and Dawn were pretty easy, Portrait had its moments, and Order was pretty ball-busting, especially in the early game. Bloodstained has a nice lead-in, and then a pretty sharp incline at about halfway, and that stays pretty consistent for the rest of the game, which I appreciated. A few bosses made me a little ragey, but in retrospect, it may have been my fault for not upping my kit. \n\nThere's a crafting system in the game, which is going to form the majority of your gear scaling, rather than depending on drops from baddies. I ignored this system for the vast majority, and I can tell you now: DON'T. It's not even that I didn't want to do it; I just didn't think to. I was a little more accustomed to dudes dropping items when I ice them. Here, you get ingredients often enough that whenever you ""go back to town"", so to speak, it's worth checking in with your alchemist mate and seeing if his selection has increased. Don't worry, if you're looking to maximize everything, the grind is actually really well-adjusted. WILL you have to grind for items and occasionally levels? Yes. How much did it pad my playtime? Prrrrrobably about two hours. That's out of a game that was roughly 30 hours the first time through. Individual playtime may be longer or shorter depending on familiarity with the general formula.\n\nHonestly, a big part of what makes having to do such things fun in this game when it's execrable in others is that moving around the castle just feels SO GOOD and combat is a LOT of fun. This is one of maybe five games I have loved enough to want to 100%, and that was the ONLY reason I had to grind what is, I think, the ONLY item with a 1% drop rate (most other items have very reasonable percentages), and even that didn't take more than about five minutes. I just want to get ahead of any potential naysayers who might be turned off by crafting systems or grinding and promise you that it's not a factor you should let sway you.\n\nI'm not gonna go into the story. Demons over there; kill they ass. Yes, it's more complex than that; no, I'm not going to go into it, because my reviews are too long and wanky anyway. It's good. It's cool. And there are a lot of callbacks and references for old-time dorks like me. I WILL say the voiceacting is real good. I mean, we got Snake, so you know the cast isn't fulla rookies and people fresh off of doing ISP ads.\n\nHaving all the folks who made Igavania awesome in the first place (Iga, Michiru Yamane, Shutaro Iida, Ayami Kojima, etc) coming back means that this game can be everything the old games were, even if they have to duck around copyrights. That's not ALL this game is, and I mean that to tell both old fans and complete rookies that A) you don't have to worry about this game just being a big circlejerk, remembering the old days and nostalgia, and B) you don't have to have played the old ones to enjoy the game on its own merits. It does enough of the old stuff that returning fans will have easter eggs and injokes to enjoy, and someone who's never played a 'Vania (Classic or Iga) will find a game that gives them their money's worth.\n\nI had one complaint, by the end of it all, and that complaint turned out to not be Recommended, which was nice. Originally, I thought the moves were restricted to specific weapons, meaning no one weapon in any class (with a few exceptions) could do every move. Turned out, it was Final Fantasy Tactics Advance rules: use a weapon to learn a technique, master it, and then any weapon of its type can do it. This meant the best katana in the game allowed me to do Vergil-style flash-step cuts, and I was EXTREMELY pleased. So I was pretty much left with nothing to mark it down for. In terms of what it is, anyway.\n\nI will say, in the way of shortcomings which are there that didn't bother me (but may bother others), there are a few textboxes that are missing single words, which I thought was odd, and SOME cutscene animations (particularly one just before the end boss) are a liiiiiittle wonky-looking. The text I expect will get patched, and since you have voice acting, it's not like it'll register as anything more than a ""buh?""  moment in about three dialogues in the entire game. As for some wonky animations, it shouldn't amount to anything more than a snrk from you before getting back to the fight.\n\nPretty much the only thing that keeps this from just being the next Castlevania we all wanted is that there's no Dracula. And that sucks, sure, but I'm still really happy we got this. I WILL say, however, that it has Alucard. Straight up. Alucard shows up in this game. Symphony geeks especially will get a kick out of it, because the character is friggin' voiced by Robert Belgrade. Meaning this is the first time he has EVER reprised his role as that character in twenty bloody years. It's a small interaction, but it made me giggle.\n\nI was REAL salty about the delays and the worry that it was going to be a massive letdown, as were many backers after the Mighty Number 9 debacle, and Yooka-Laylee's letdown (which I've also voiced my concerns over). That said, this has all culminated in me being extremely happy that the one of the original three resurrections on Kickstarter that I backed is the one that turned out awesome, added to the fact that it has my name in the credits. Pretty absolutely sick.\n\nONE LAST THING I wanted to mention that I can't really comment on: There have been a lot of people complaining about graphical glitches and freezing on their systems. I'm not sure what causes this, and I haven't experienced it. Now, because I FUCKING LOATHE those people on forums who post just to say ""works fine for me"" when people are complaining about issues with a game, I just want to say it's something to be cognizant of going forward, if you're not sure. There was a patch released about four days after the game came out that was almost a gig, and I couldn't find a changelog. I didn't notice any changes in my game, and nothing was added in terms of content, so I think it might have been technical patching, but I don't know, one way or the other. If you're running an older machine or are just concerned in general, I'd say give that a look to see what people are saying before you buy. I would really hate to breathlessly gush about a game and have someone be let down by it when it doesn't work. Just a heads-up.",Recommended
"Excellent game. If you are a fan of SOTN, just inject this right into your body. \nIt has some very annoying bugs like sometimes you are unable to pick up loot properly and Ive had a couple CTDs. Without these present, I would be addicted to this game even more.",Recommended

"After 50+ hours of game play and basically doing everything you possibly can collection wise on normal mode I can say with out a doubt that this game was what I have been waiting for. Iga did it again by making an amazing metroidvania game. The best way I could describe it is a love letter to castlevania. It had TONS of referances to SOTN ( my favorite game of all time) and adds basically all the wonderful mechanics of other castlevanias together. The arsenal of SOTH, the soul system from Aria/dawn of sorrow, and techniques like portrait.\n\nThis is a worthy successor to the castlevania series and I cant wait to get even more playtime out of it. I just started NG+, we should be getting 2 more characters, co-op and vs modes, the roughlike castle, and boss revenge mode where we should be able to play as the various bosses of the game. Its already great and its going to get even better.\n\nTL:DR If you loved castlevania from SOTN to OOE then buy this game and enjoy.",Recommended
"Many games have carried the torch of the Metroidvania style since Super Metroid and Symphony of the Night defined it. Some of them have been very, very good. But this? This is the definitive spiritual successor to Symphony and I hope we see more from Iga.",Recommended
"SotN was a classic that has lasted the ages.  I've played every single NES CV and GBA & DS Igavania game.  I've enjoyed games like Metroid Fusion and Zero Mission, and the old classic Metroid games.  Also enjoyed Shadow Complex and a bit of Axiom Verge. Sufficed to say, I like Metroidvania games, or at least the SotN-styled formula.  \n\nThis is the only game, and perhaps will be the only one ever, that I've Kickstarted.  I figured if anyone knew how to make this styled game, it would be led by Koji Igarashi.  I'm about 10hrs or so in and I can say this game doesn't disappoint in that regards.  It's exactly what it should be.  I don't think it's revolutionary but it is what it needed to be.  I think the game should likely be about 25-30hrs long, depending on how long the latter portions go.  The DLCs should provide a lot of extra ways to enjoy the game further.  I think $40 is a fine amount -- I'm pretty sure that's what the DS games costed new.  So if you like games that are slavishly SotN type games, this should be a no brainer.  If you're just casually a Metroid or platform lover, give it some time for a Steam sale.  It might not bring anything new to the table but that's not always a bad thing.",Recommended
"I am very happy to be playing a new IGAvania in 2019. It's been far too long since the heyday of the DS games.\n\nIf you're familiar with Symphony of the Night, Aria of Sorrow, or any of the Castlevania games on the Nintendo DS, then you have an idea of what this game offers. They managed to get the general control of the game to feel the same, which is nice. There's good variety in terms of weapons and shards (spells basically). The music and visuals were okay, not really on par with any past 'vanias, but not bad.\n\nI do have some complaints, though. Difficulty on normal was far too easy, and that was with me mostly ignoring attack shards and not crafting many weapons. Shards in general absolutely break this game. Compare with Souls or Skills, which helped without eclipsing other attack options. Also, some areas in the game are far too small and linear. Mostly I have this complaint with the final third of the game, I suppose. The ultimate zone in particular is poor, with a boring aesthetic, low enemy variety, no traps or puzzles, and criminally small size. It's effectively a few hallways connecting the last 3 (or 4) bosses. It just felt bad when comparing to Chaotic Realm or The Abyss.\n\nI did enjoy the game despite my gripes. I sincerely hope this performs well, so that we can get another IGAvania in the future.",Recommended
"Excellent game on its own merits for the price, even if the playtime might be considered ""low"" by most people, this is what comes with the genre of handcrafted games that can be easily replayed many times.\n\nWhen considering that it is a kickstarted game, breathing life into a long thought dead genre? Absolutely astounding game that accomplishes everything it set out to do.\n\nEither way, solid reccomendation from me. The combat is fluid and satisfying, the spells are bombastic and awesome, the progression system is incredibly smart and rewarding for curious explorers, and the level design is beyond superb. Never get caught up in ""where the hell do I go?"" trappings unlike many other similar games in the genre. This is because progressing in the game often comes down to simply remembering one or two REALLY important things that the game itself even explicitly notes as odd.",Recommended

Combat fluidity, some cool story and enemy designs, great levels with... well... fluid gameplay, good puzzles. It's really hard to pinpoint what exactly is so good in the game. It's basically... like... all this, all these. Every gameplay mechanic stitched together and producing this fun fluidity in everything! There are some issues in terms of what player can think at the moment according to developers, where to go to, but simple googling can fix this. Basically I recommend this game to everyone who likes original Castlevania, to everyone who's just curious and to everyone who likes this genre.",Recommended

"I've always been a huge Castlevania fan growing up. Upon hearing that Igarashi was working on a new game after so many years that was returning to the old style metroidvania games, I was pretty excited.\n\nI think it's important to talk about the 2 year delay this game had. I wasn't the biggest fan of how the game looked originally but I figured gameplay can excuse some issues with the visuals. Igarashi thought otherwise, based on fan feedback, and had the game updated over the next few years. I have to say that it really looks a lot better. I really enjoy the visuals the game has, even if some of the over the top lighting seems a bit aggressive on the eyes at times.\n\nThe gameplay feels like a more polished Symphony of the Night and I'm really happy to see some of the interesting things they've accomplished  with the combat, especially the shard system and some weapons having their own command moves was a nice addition to the game as well, even if it does make some weapons feel better than others. But I can forgive that because weapons have a their own distinctive feel to them now, even within the same weapon type because you can approach situations in a multitude of ways. It really helps ease the monotony that the combat flow has with metroidvania games, though I realize that's entirely my opinion. Some people love the simplistic nature of gameplay, which is not something I can usually stick with these days. \n\nThat being said, the gameplay in general here is top notch. There was never a moment in my entire playthrough where I got bored of the combat or the exploration. Exploration in this game was super fun. I had a great time finding breakable walls and secrets areas, like the 8-bit nightmare, that were really rewarding upon finding them. Maybe a new weapon, upgrades, or money for the shops in town. Along with the areas being unique and beautifully realized, I am still looking forward to finding the last bit of upgrades and shards.\n\nThis game was really worth the wait and I am beyond happy with what we've gotten. 10/10 for me personally.",Recommended

"Overall: 9.5/10\n\nTL;DR: This isn't a ""SOTN-inspired metroidvania"". This game feels like the dev team that made SOTN went to remake it in 2019, this would be the game that came out. There's absolutely everything to love and nearly nothing to hate if you're even mildly a fan of the genre. Devs, give yourselves a pat on the back - you did more than anyone could have ever dreamed you could.\n\nGameplay: 9.9/10\n\nAn absolute charmer that nailed everything about what we loved about Castlevania Symphony of the Night and then some. A myraid of weapons and spells, several movement options - from lightspeed dashing to the tried-and-Recommended backdash cancelling to moonwalk your way from one side of the map to the other - and of course, each weapon comes packed with its own secret set of moves for you to either learn about through finding books in the castle or to stumble upon simply by performing the button combination at any time.\n\nMy only nitpick is I would have wanted a way to hot-swap weapons without having to set up entire armor and spell quickslots, but that's such a minor thing and certainly not impossible with a small patch or two.\n\n\nGraphics: 9/10\n\nI was put off on the graphics through all of the backing still images and teasers we got for the game. It looked a bit too cartoonish, a bit too clunky, and didn't seem to mesh well together. \n\nBOY was I wrong. Still frames of this game may not be the prettiest still, but in motion it all flows together as a beautiful masterpiece. Enemies and attacks pop vividly from the background, and the VFX on some of the attacks and spells are so pretty I used them just to look at. \n\nCharacter faces in dialogue still seem too stiff for my liking, but its not like they're horrendous to look at.\n\nAudio: 10/10\n\nThe music is absolutely bonkers, I can't believe how incredible the soundtrack is. Atmospheric when it needs to be, dark and menacing for bosses, and absolutely hype and pumping as you explore the entirety of the castle.\n\nThe voice acting is also surprisingly great, and just as I never tire of Alucard yelling ""SOUL STEAL"", I never tire hearing Miriam yell out one of the myriad of voice lines for her spells.\n\nStory: 8.5/10\n\nIts better than what I expected, but nothing so groundbreaking as to say its worth buying the game for. It is serviceable for the entirety of the game and never feels overly camp or cliche.\n\nEnding:\n\nWhile the devs could have taken some inspiration from more modern games for some quality of life adjustments, such as quick weapon swapping (or even having 2 weapons equipped at once), There's not an inch of this game I don't love.  Its worth more than the $40 its listed for,and its worth getting on any type of sale for sure.",Recommended

The bosses are interesting with a wide range of difficulty, the weapon and magic selection is endless and the combat is perfect. \n\nSeriously, if you like SotN, Aria of Sorrow, Portrait of Ruin or Order of Ecclesia then you will 100% enjoy this game.",Recommended

"Video review here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mX8mtcDlAp4&ab_channel=Wolfborgg\n\nKoji Igarashi is one of my new personal heroes after experiencing Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night. Iga is a former producer of the Castlevania series, having first directed Castlevania: Symphony of the Night back in 1997. When Konami wouldn’t let him make a new Castlevania that fans wanted, focusing on mobile games instead, Iga left in 2014 to Kickstart and make a spiritual successor to Castlevania himself.\n\nBloodstained: Ritual of the Night is a really enjoyable Metroidvania. I’ve actually never played a Castlevania game before myself, but if Bloodstained’s gameplay is anything like the older Castlevania games, then I’ve really been missing out. You fight demons and monsters as a Shardbinder, people who were experimented on by alchemists and now possess the ability to use the powers of crystal shards. As you fight your way through the levels, you gain more shards from the enemies and bosses you defeat and you can use new powers from the shards as a part of your loadout.\n\nVisually it’s fantastic. The way the backgrounds look with the 3D level design is just beautiful. I saw the old trailer for the game during one of my anime night Twitch streams a long time ago and I remember not thinking much about it. Especially the visuals, which I didn’t care for at all. Now, you can find a new trailer where Iga shows everyone else’s criticisms on top of old gameplay before saying he’ll “prove us wrong” and then showing vastly updated visuals of the game now. I gotta say, the man knows how to market his games.\n\nIt’s definitely not a perfect game, though. There’s some things about it that definitely give it the “Kickstarter game” feel, especially the dialog scenes. It’s also hard for me to tell what parts of the levels are platforms and what are part of the background sometimes, but that doesn’t happen often and that might be something done on purpose to hide certain things later in the game.\n\nThe enemies and other characters have great designs though. I love Zangetsu especially even though all he’s done so far is show up and kick my ass for about an hour because I’m bad at video games. There’s also a giant cat with horns in a portal… I mean… what more do you need to hear?",Recommended
"I would like to say this game very good 10/10, When we think Castlevania is dead series in Konami forever, but thanks Iga and Dev team to bring this series coming back under ""Bloodstained"". I love that name and the new series with main char Miriam, Zangetsu <3.",Recommended
"This game is a masterpiece of its genre. Made by the mind behind Castlevania: Symphony of the Night, one of the best game ever created (and definetely the best of its series). Bloodstained is a massive metroidvania with a great map, fantastic unique enemies, very interesting story, lovable characters, tons of different weapons, techniques, magic, upgrades, crafting and shopping. There are so many things in this rpg-style 2.5D that you will spend dozens of hours meddling with all of it.\nWith a great gameplay, strong replayability, a NG+ and higher difficulties for more challenge, bosses that will beat the living daylight out of you, and of course enough secret passages to make you go insane. The game is also blessed with fast travel (in the most Castlevania style) and a quick-recall home that some of the genre manage to miss.\nThe music in this game is a special case. Its so good and well in tone with the castlevania style that one can not resist staying in an area just to listen to the music, and later searching for it on the internet.\nI will not lie, once in my gameplay I had a crash, a ""fatal error"" and lost some progress, but besides that, the game runs flawlessly\nI see people complaining about the difficulty level. This game was not created to be ""the dark souls of metroidvanias"" one can not bash it for something the developer had never the intention of. Not a single Castlevania in metroidvania-style was tough, it was all about enjoying the game, seeing the beautiful art on it, playing to your heart's content and watching the story unfold in that huge castle while you search for secrets and the 100% (or more) completion.\nYou can easily see that this game was made with a lot of love and attention to detail (An idle pose for every category of weapon, the faerie sing for you!), with the intent of pleasing the consumer. And it does, masterfully.\nBloodstained is a must-have of the genre and even better if you want to try the ""metroidvania"" style. I absolutely recommend this one.",Recommended
"Beautiful game. Took my a while to complete my first run with all shards and full map exploration, but the game is awesome, I'd call it the best Metroidvania out there on PC (tohether with Hollow Knight).\nBest thing: There will be a ton of free DLCs which increases the replayability by a lot, I'd say.\nTotally worth the money and an hommage to all Castlevania fans out there",Recommended

"I actually backed this game and I'm glad I did.  If you're looking for a Castlevania fix and you liked the era from Symphony of the Night up until before Lords of Shadow, this game has your fix.  It is a Recommended Castlevania game in all but name.  If you haven't played the series, this is a fun Metroidvania with a continuation of what Super Metroid and Symphony of the Night started.\n\nThe homage to the Castlevania games is huge here.  Miriam plays very similarly to Soma Cruz from Aria of Sorrow and Dawn of Sorrow except you use shards instead of souls.  You have quests like in Portrait of Ruin and Order of Ecclesia.  As for Symphony of the Night, there are a LOT of nods to that game, including a reference to the inverted castle (minus the tedium).\n\nIf you're a completionist, then this game will keep you occupied for a long time.  There's also New Game Plus and a Level 1 mode alongside other modes.\n\nAt the time of this review, there were 2 issues I had:\n\n1. item bags can sometimes get stuck in a wall if you kill and enemy there, though you will automatically get the spoils after a certain length of time if this happens.\n\n2. Progression in the game takes a small curve ball when you need to first traverse underwater.  Fortunately, it's something that's very possible to stumble into.  ([spoiler] Get a shard from the Deeseama enemy.  This is the only essential shard you don't get from bosses or shard pedestals. [/spoiler])\n\nOverall, the positives outweigh the negatives here.  \n\n9/10 HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",Recommended
"This is a good game with a fatal flaw: it's PAINFULLY easy, and requires you to complete the whole game to unlock additional difficulties. The only boss to kill me was the very first one. The only way to get a reasonable challenge is to either use a cheat code to unlock Nightmare mode from the start, or to put artificial limits on your difficulty/challenge runs (ie avoid certain weapons/techniques... except there are about 30 you'll need to avoid, since *many* of the spells are OP).\n\nI got 22 hours out of it, but they weren't very rewarding, just a lot of button mashing. Bosses die in literally under 10 seconds. It can be satisfying and fun for a little bit to run around and watch everything melt, but it's shallow and doesn't make for a good experience.\n\nThe main argument on the forums I see is ""Symphony of the Night was unbalanced and easy, so this game should be too."" If you think that because a game made over 20 years ago was flawed, a game made today should also have those same flaws, I have no words for you.\n\nFans of this game might want to check out another little-known game that also provides the same sense of satisfaction, and is available for free on web or mobile: Cookie Clicker.",Not Recommended
"Beat this game on Normal and Hard and I am having a lot of fun with this title. Personally I like it much more than Symphony of the Night for offering tight and responsive gameplay and a difficulty curve for almost all skill types. This game can be as easy or as hard as you make it pretty much. \n\nThe game is beautiful... Don't let naysayers fool you into thinking otherwise. The environments vary from pretty nice to borderline stunning sometimes. However, I do notice this title seems to aim towards a more family friendly audiences than the Castlevania games it took inspiration from. Well, not exactly ""family friendly"", but how can I describe it? I mean, there's plenty of blood, but there's hardly any gory images or depictions of nude art anywhere. Not that I'm saying this matters, but it is noticeable. I recall Castlevania monsters being much more grotesque at times while this game can sometimes come off as kinda cartoony in comparison. This is not a deterrent for me by any means, but it may bother those who want the see a more mature title coming from Iga. \n\nThe shard system is great, however, it does suffer from some shards being clearly much more useful than others. There's hardly any balance here and most people are going to roughly use the same dozen shards over and over rather than experiment which I feel these games try to encourage. I really love the shortcut system and it's the biggest selling point of this game for me. The shortcut mechanic is literally what these types of games always needed.\n\nPeople compare this game a lot to SotN and AoS, but I see inspirations from many of the Castlevania games. The bosses are certainly more like OOE, but not as hard. I can't say if it's because the bosses are not as hard or if the player character is just more overpowered... Could be a bit of both. \n\nThis game gets some criticism for being a bit too old school and not being innovative enough to compete with other titles in the genre. So it's important for me to add that in a way, this title is more for Igavania fans than Metroidvania fans particularly. You gotta be very passionate about Igavanias to truly appreciate this game, and even then, some Igavania fans may be too purist to ever accept this title as a worthy contender. So I'll have to be honest, it's really hard to say if this title will be for you or not, because this title caters to such a niche community who may or may not accept this title. Best I can say is take the gamble I guess? \n\nProbably the only main issue I have with this game is of course the bugs. This is not a secret by now. This game has issues with frames, graphical and gameplay oddities, and crashing. Be prepared! If the idea of bugs bother you, it's probably just best to wait out this title until they are done patching it. You'll get the game as the price reduces and you'll come out getting a more quality title than earlier adaptors.

"I can't decide whether I like this game or Symphony of the Night more. And if I'm having a hard time deciding that, it should tell you how much fun this game is.",Recommended
"I always loved Metroidvania Castlevania games. This one is a combination of SotN, Arial/Dawn of Soorow, Portrait of Ruin and Order of Ecclesia. It's the Castlevania we all deserved.",Recommended

Just the best game of 2019!,Recommended
"It's really sick, you should buy it!",Recommended
"Incredible game.  The variety of combat between using guns, kicks, swords, area magic, direction magic and a ton of other things keeps it from getting stale.  Level design is a little linear but I still think that many areas change it up.  If you like Metriod-Vania games then this game is for you.  My biggest grip is that it is capped at 60fps.  The motion seems very blurry so it would have been great to play at 120+ with low persistence monitor to get super clear motion.  Anyway if you have a 4k TV then it is a fun and gorgeous game.",Recommended

"Kickstarted games have been divisive to say the least. From great successes such as A Hat in Time and Shovel Knight, to some abysmal failures like Mighty No.9 and the mediocre Yooka-Laylee. I'm thankful to say that Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night has ended up on the positive side.\n\nUnlike previous Kickstarter projects, RotN doesn't quite set out to modernise its genre. Instead, it focuses heavily on polishing its gameplay and RPG systems. I think this is a testament of how compelling the Metroidvania style is. Miriam is quite sharp to control; which may be off-putting to new players at first but becomes crucial on later bosses and harder difficulties. The breadth of weapons and abilities you can choose between is also near overwhelming. I'm sure everyone will find their own unique build that matches their play-style.\n\nWhile crafting and level-ups are a large aspect of the game; they don't undermine skilled play. Bosses and stronger enemies will still crush you without learning their attack pattern. Each individual room is also well designed, while enemies are copied almost frame by frame from other games; there was obviously a large amount of thought put into what enemies go where and how to create a fun combat experience.\n\nUnfortunately, these well-crafted rooms can get tedious quickly because of how badly the castle itself is laid out. While each area thematically makes sense in its placement, the second half of the game is a bit of a mess. You can quite easily find yourself at the final boss and therefore the Bad Ending well before discovering half of the map. While this was on purpose, it's likely that many players didn't even know they had found the end of the game or that the story was trying to lead them elsewhere. This leads to a strange segment where players must guess which area will correctly give them the next ability they need without a clear goal.\n\nOverall this is more of a nit-pick than a proper flaw due to the stellar soundtrack and art style. Each music track has its own energy that breathes life in each area. While not the prettiest game, its stark lighting and interactive backgrounds make up for the technical shortcomings. Being so fun to control, along with a great soundtrack and clear visuals mean even the most frustrating moments are forgivable. \n\nIt's a lot of fun and worth checking out if you're an old fan of the genre, or someone looking for a good entry point.",Recommended
"Meh.\n\nJust, meh.\n\nThat's all I can say about the game.\n\nI'm a backer, and I waited years for a 'meh' successor to Symphony of the Night.\n\nNot good, not terrible, just.. average in every way, leaning towards the 'poor' side.\n\nFeels like it was extremely budgeted with the developers spending most of their time learning how to use Unreal Engine 4.  Janky animations and scene transitions, 16:9 locked to 3 resolutions [i](21:9 mod available but currently breaks UI in certain menus)[/i], default UE4 graphics options, only 1 keybind per hotkey selectable yet multiple are bound by default and can't be rebound in the options, no mouse cursor yet mouse is usable (extremely janky in menus), XBOX button prompts for gamepad only (PS4 mod available).  See PCGW for some of the fixes: https://pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Bloodstained:_Ritual_of_the_Night\n\nThe entire game feels really slow besides that.  The methods to speed it up feel like they come from straight poor design rather than a ""high skill level trick"".  Combat is one button; no combos or anything, just you standing there pressing 1 button and only being able to attack forward, not in multiple directions like Super Castlevania on the SNES.  It's either forward, crouched forward, or crouched down-forward with certain weapons.\n\nYou can attack twice in rapid succession by attacking just before you land.. because the animation resets when you land, because of poor design as mentioned above.  There's ""techniques"" which are like a fighting game move, but they're obnoxious to perform, most can't be chained (if even an attack), and drain a lot of your mana.  You will be basic attacking most of the time.\n\nYou will facetank things a lot because of how stiff the combat feels, and how slow your character moves.\n\nThe ""shard"" mechanic is just another button, you press to use a one skill in one way.  Most of the shards are completely garbage and there's a few that are brokenly overpowered to trivialize the game.\n\nVoice acting hit or miss.  There are anime voice actors in here, along with others you may know (David Hayter).  But even with a good voice cast, the auDIO LeVEls aRe alL oVEr the PLaCe.  Seriously, you can barely hear the dialogue sometimes even if you turn down sounds/music [i](which are ridiculously loud by default, and the game comes set at 5/10 master volume; I don't even understand how it could be so loud.)[/i]  [b]There's no volume normalization AT ALL.[/b]\n\nMiram's battle grunts with most weapons make me want to mute the voices; they're just obnoxious and don't repeat well.  There is Japanese voices, but unless you're a filthy weeb, you'd rather have the English voice acting.  If we had the JP battle grunts but English dialogue, that would be a lot better, but that's not possible unless someone mods the game.\n\nAnd the script is.. well, could be better. \n\n\nHonestly I just don't see myself completing this game.  It just feels so below average to me that I'd rather go play SotN instead.  Maybe I'll pick it back up after it's had months more time worked on it, but as it stands right now, unless you're the most diehard Castlevania fan and desperately want another game like it, wait for things to improve... if they ever do.",Not Recommended
"I take no pleasure in negatively reviewing this game. I am glad it exists and anything that sticks it to modern Konami is fine by me.\n\nHowever, I cannot get into this game. \n\nI do not like the graphical style at all. SotN looks good even today because of its gorgeous sprite artwork. The artwork in this game is garish. The UI writing looks very cheap. Most surfaces seem reflective as if they're covered in grease. Miriam popping through floors when jumping up or down looks odd. The animations in game play seem sluggish, which really stands out against the few cinematic scenes I saw which animated nicely.\nThe game play itself feels sluggish to me, too. Weapons feel like they have little impact. There is a good variety of them and they all act differently, and I only scratched the surface. But they mostly left me feeling cold.\nIn the sound department, I don't like the voice acting, either. It's like the voice acting in Dust: An Elysium Tail, which I didn't really like in that (otherwise very nice) game. But Dust, Fidget and the merchants didn't keep blithering [i]every time[/i] you purchased or crafted an item. Both games also featured melodramatic voice acting, but Dust had different poses and animations for characters to emphasise and suit their lines. Bloodstained just has characters standing there moving their mouths. They feel so disconnected from the dialogue, I would have rather just had portraits.\nThe music was very nice, though. I may just purchase the soundtrack later.\n\nI can see potential within this game and [i]I want to like it.[/i] But it doesn't feel polished at all and I can't justify paying 62 dollarydoos for this.\nIt is nice to see that many backers got what they wanted.",Not Recommended

"[b][u]The Short of It:[/u][/b]\n\n[i]Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night[/i] is a nostalgic, but at the same time modern Metroidvania with RPG elements that remains challenging and enticing to play through, without ever making its difficulty unfair or unnecessarily punishing.\n\n[b][u]The Long of It:[/u][/b]\n\nAfter greedy alchemists perform ritual killings to unleash demons on the world, only two people escape the sacrifices. One of them is Miriam, who remained in a coma for years until she is finally reawakened to apply pedal force to demon posterior. To do this, she must infiltrate a castle, brave its halls, depts and heights, and acquire new abilities, weapons, and equipment to aid in expediting the forceful connection of her feet to demon rears.\n\nThe game itself plays much as a standard Metroidvania, with some key differences. One is the heightened focus on equipment, inventory and crafting, giving the game RPG elements (though never making it a Recommended RPG, which requires influence on story and characters). Another is the mechanics of shards, random drops from enemies that give Miriam all sorts of gluteus-kicking abilities. \n\n[b][u]The Right of It:[/u][/b]\n\n[i]Bloodstained[/i] is a perfect blend of nostalgia and modernity, a game that will make older players feel like coming home, and will make newer players realize just what it was that made previous generations of video games so special. \n\nMiriam’s fighting styles are also quite diverse, with many different weapons handling in distinct ways, making it possible for the player to choose his preferred playstyle, with only a few weapon types being less useful. From the slow, but powerful overhead wallop of the greatsword to the short, sharp kicks delivered by weaponized boots, all kinds of weapon styles let you fight your own way, with plenty of room for experimenting.\n\nThe difficulty, too, is refreshing: it’s genuinely challenging, even to a veteran player of video games, but it’s never unfair and does not succumb to the temptation of trying to be the next Dark Souls Of, like so many products try to do lately. The game keeps you on your toes, but you will generally only die if you overreach, attack mindlessly, or get complacent.  There is no need to memorize every single enemy’s attack patterns, and even bosses can be successfully engaged by using one’s head and having sharp reflexes without needing a hundred tries or looking up attack patterns on a wiki. All bosses are perfectly beatable on the first try (I’ve done it) if you’ve levelled somewhat decently, prepare sufficiently, and keep your head in the game.\n\nOn the technical side, the game is more than decent. The graphics aren’t AAA-quality, but they’re certainly good enough to keep the game enjoyable, and the music, too, is quite adequate at maintaining the atmosphere. Miriam's constant yelps when she attacks are a bit grating, but I s'pose that comes with the territory.\n\nAnother positive thing is the ‘grindability’ of enemies. Not only do they respawn every time the player leaves the screen, but their random drops also occur sufficiently frequently to make farming a viable possibility. There is no 1-in-256 Danjuro in this game – at least not that I’ve encountered.\n\nLastly, the game is simply lots of fun to play, the castle is exciting to explore and even though things can take a long time, they never get tiresome or tedious.\n\n[b][u]The Wrong of It:[/u][/b]\n\nThere is little wrong with [i]Bloodstained[/i], but a few things did bother me as I played. The controls are not always equally responsive and the game tends not to always react perfectly to button presses, especially where it concerns jumps. I also noticed that the game has the inverse of coyote time: sometimes Miriam runs off a ledge before it runs out so you miss a jump. Not game-breaking, but a bit annoying. The Lili form especially can choke up during a sequence of intense jumping and kicking.\n\nAnother thing which is a bit bothersome is the tendency of enemies to ‘hug’ the player, projecting their hitboxes over the player’s and basically immobilizing them with constant scratch damage, which is irritating for players who use slower weapons, since with larger enemies, even backstepping doesn’t free them. Enemies being able to clip freely into walls and off screen edges is another small annoyance, since this lets them escape attacks or makes their loot inaccessible. \n\nLastly, the story is very flimsy and serves merely as a backdrop, which is a shame since more could have been done with it.\n\nAll in all though, these are small things and the game is still extremely enjoyable despite them.\n\n[b][u]The Last of It:[/u][/b]\n\n[i]Bloodstained[/i] is worth every penny, and will provide a player with many hours of enjoyment, and being a Metroidvania fan isn’t a requirement, nor is it necessary to be le hardcore epic Recommended gamer hero (though Hard and Impossible modes do exist for the masochists). No one but the most extremely jaded cynic will be disappointed.",Recommended

"Literally just a more RPG version of Castlevania: Symphony of the Night, even made by the same lead. I'm so in love with this game it's not even funny. Just constantly daydreaming about it.",Recommended
"Going to start off saying that I feel for the people who are running into progression bugs and performance issues, on PC and on consoles like switch; if I had those issues while playing this game I'd definitely be frustrating, because this is such a hard-to-stop-playing game, and because every good thing in this game seems to come with a caveat of sorts. It's a fantastic game, but its rough edges almost drag it under the surface.\n\nLet's start off with general thoughts: games like these tend to not hold your hand very well at the start, and that pushes new players away more often than not before they can get to the creamy parts. The start of bloodstained was done well enough that I think that won't be an issue, but there's definitely a whole bunch of stuff I wish they told you outright (READ the tips, it really does help). The character designs are great, and you do empathize a bit with the characters from what little interaction you get from them, but there's definitely a whole lot more they could have done with them. I don't think there was anything drastically problematic with how the game ran for me, and I did like how customizable the options for game was for a small developer.\n\nThe graphics in this game is probably the least polished of the major elements. I said the character designs were great, and you can tell they put a lot of thought into them, but the end result is just a tad bit too rough at times. The lightning engine makes everything give off a strange smoothness quality to their appearance, even if there's a rough texture on that model. Other Character models besides Miriam have really simple and limited set of actions in-and-out of cutscenes, and facial expressions could do quite a bit of work; this is especially apparent when you get a closer look at a model during dialogue or menu screens. The color usage however is great, and it has a really appreciable balance between vividness and obscurity that makes things stand out when you want to look at them, and hide when you are focused on the action. As a consequence of that and probably a whole lot of work, the backgrounds are probably what came out looking the best, and it really shows. I think they did a great job with it and it helps make the game stylish and memorable to its own rights, There's definitely room for improvement overall, but unfortunately i think that's something you just have to accept from a non-major game company. \n\nThe sound design in this game is great, but I think sometimes they made it too sensitive to sound corresponding to fast moving objects and other things that can go from one screen side to the other. The music is fantastic, and I have a few themes that I think I will remember vividly. Voice acting is decent, but by virtue of the models and the cutscenes's quality i think a lot of it gets lost in presentation, and that's a shame.\n\nThe gameplay, however, helps push any of those issues aside for me.\nI think the game has almost perfect pacing gameplay-wise. What you get in the game rewards you enough that you want to keep playing, and there's enough in each new area that keeps you engaged, curious, and thinking about what you can do to make this area easier for yourself. The game, at its most basic, is a very slow, monotone sidescroll RPG with a lot of tricky and annoying enemies; but the game gives you a plethora of options to deal with all of them, and rewards you for working on achieving those options. You can shoot lasers, counter attacks, distract with your silver knight, stack a shard spell on top of itself for massive damage, play run and gun with accelerate and firearms...there's just a lot of stuff you can try out and have fun with. It's a game filled with fun experiments and optimizations, and it doesn't force you to have really precise timing or reflexes either because you can always find another way through. That said, once you do get to late game, there's a few drastically superior items that might make certain players feel bland. There are also some other minor gripes (I wish there was more balance to the weapon variety and corresponding weapon skills, for example) and the grind can feel somewhat tedious at times, but at the very least on the steam version, loading times are beyond remarkable, and the game rewards you for finding good grinding spots.\n\nI'd definitely recommend this game to others.",Recommended
great googely moogely this game tickles the spot that you normally cant.  Its good in that ever so fun and perfect way that sotn did way back when.

"After playing and beating the game (100% map) for 25hrs I can said is that... Yes, this is the Castlevania game you have been waiting for the last decade and you will enjoy every second of it. Iga do not only deliver a properly Castlevania game, he also established a new franchise with Bloodstained: RotN. \n\nI have to be honest the game looks good but is not mind blowing on graphics and the animations on cutscenes or dialog boxes are kind of bad. Also it doesn't bring anything new into the table but it is ok because If something is broken, do not repair it. If I have to describe the feeling of the game I would said is mix Castlevania: SotN and AoS, and maybe some of the DS titles.\n\n[✓] Great level design\n[✓] Fun and challenging gameplay\n[✓] Great artstyle\n[✓] Interesting characters and enemies(with interesting, funny and cheesy dialogue)\n[✓] Amazing OST\n[✓] Rewarding and customized RPG system\n[✓/X] Good story but the ending is little lackluster.\n[✓/X ] Good UI design but the map could also use a legend to easy located some rooms NPC(OD room and hairdresser room) or to know the meaning some simbols (sidequest scrolls, chests, NPC diamonds\n[✓/X] Good replay value but a little lack of difficulty on +NG (except for Nightmare option).\n[X] Bad facial animations on dialog boxes and some stiff animations on some cutscenes.\n[X] Disappointing and easy final boss.\n[X] Some items are hard to find if you don't have a specific clue of an specific NPC.\n\nIn conclusion Bloodstained: RotN is great game and is a the game that any metroidvania fans have been waiting, the game isn't perfect but it opens the door for a bright future of this franchise.",Recommended

"Alright, let's see. This game is going to give you a wild ride specially if you are a Castlevania nostalgic fan as I am. The game itself is short, but all what it provides is as intense as Symphony of the Night / Portrait of Ruin / Aria of Sorrow provided to all of us back in the days: An excellent OST mixed with a very good level design (A map slightly small to my taste however as for in 21 hours I managed to get a 98,5% of the map discovered) and really interesting mechanics going on in the game.\n\nThe magic system is wonderful, there are plenty magics you can choose from to amold from your playstyle, and yet there are quite a few more I have to get as I didn't intend to grind them all. Alchemy only helps on enhancing them even more, providing really trainwrecking combos with magic and your weapons.\n\nHowever, there are certain magic mechanics I feel they could have exploited better (transformation shards, familiars for example, there are very few of these along the game and it's a shame as there is a very wide variety of demons that could have been awesome familiars or transformations for Miriam)\n\nOST is as good as old castlevania games was. No joke, I felt all the way in the game as a big-ass nostalgia trip into any of my beloved 2D games from my child-teenagehood.\n\nWould I recommend? Yes, of course. Maybe not for 35€ like it is right now, but for 20-25€, granted.",Recommended

"What can I say about this game that hasn't already been said a dozen times by so many other people? This is an outstanding return to form for director Koji Igarashi(of Castlevania fame). The gameplay has the right weight and feel to it, the enemies are varied and the boss encounters are all unique. If you are someone who has played and loved Castlevania: Symphony of The Night, this game is for you. Sadly, I cannot spend the entirety of this review singing praises unto the newest Igavania, there are some rather annoying issues present, though they're mainly just nitpicks. Firstly, while the characters are very nicely designed, they feel visually static and bland after the first major boss encounter. Secondly, dialogue scenes are painfully bland, placing 2 character models on top of the game screen and having them talk to each other with zero animation outside of lip flaps. Finally, and this may be more substantive than the previous complaints, the wind-up for weapon swings, I understand that in the old games, you could not attack and move simultaneously unless you had a certain weapon, played as a certain character, or had an offense based familiar active, but here, the wind-ups for weapon swings feel like they take too long, even for the short sword category of weapons. It's easy enough to adjust to, but players new to Igarashi's work, or the ""Metroidvania"" style as a whole, may find it slightly jarring at first. Overall, I highly recommend this title, and look forward to seeing what comes next.",Recommended

And the boss and speed run modes.\n\nWorth every cent of it.\n10/10 will play for years to come.\n\ntl;dr: This game is pure crack.",Recommended

100% No regret paying and supporting for this game.\n\nP/S: I can't wait to play 2nd playable character when it release :D,Recommended
"If you into old SOTN-like Castlevanias, this one is pretty much must play.\nGreat gameplays with tight controlls, what else to say?\n\nMabye one minus is games quality is off sometimes (especially end part), with bosses ranging from great, to just 'ok'. Another weird complain from me is that theres mabye too much items for its own good, because shards is where the 'meat', well mabye besides katanas, that have most weapon techs that are fun to use.\n\nAnyway, can't wait for sequel",Recommended
"I am really wanting to give this game a positive recommendation, I just can't. Several things about the game feels ""off"".\nThe game gets bulk of things rights, but it's so plagued by small things, that imo, it just feels like there's far too much filler that detracts from the quality of the game, and as a huge fan of Metroidvania games and Symphony of the Night in particular, I desperately tried to like this game, I just can't recommend it for the price tag attached to it.\n\nPros:\n- The game looks great, this 3D/2D art style is put to good use.\n- The soundtrack is amazing, the voice acting top notch, Zangetsu is Solid Snake, just great sounds.\n- The melee combat feels good, as in the actual weapon usage.\n- Controls function as intended, no weird glitches with the movement.\n\nCons: \n- You don't feel like the mechanics added to open new routes and paths, a staple of Metroidvania style games, make you any more powerful, it's just there to be a key of sorts strictly for progression.\n- I've had gamebreaking glitches happen, The Stained Glass Hand boss literally didn't move my entire fight, he just sat there while I beat his face in with repeated melee hits.\n- The movement is solid, but everything feels slow and lackluster. You run slowly, your jump is underpowered, and omission of a roll or useful backstep mechanic is missing, it's like you are missing on a core combat mechanic. And your backstep is on L1/LB while the B/Circle button is unused on controllers. And you can't remap the keys that I've discovered, which is very annoying.\n- The entire weapon system is overly convoluted and complex, there's several weapon types, that they do not explain whatsoever why one would be better than the other. Some seem overly weak for how slow they are, I'm looking at you Greatswords...\n- There are combo moves you can learn for different weapon types you can only learn from reading the journals on bookshelves around the gameworld, and they are borderline pointless for how finicky they are to use in actual combat and the lackluster damage/effects they add to the combat. They could have been left out entirely, or made simpler to be useful.\n- Guns are borderline pointless, you can only fire straight (when there is an aiming system implemented already for magic) and to be any kind of useful, you have to constantly craft/purchase ammo, which requires gold you have to farm or ingredients you will not find for awhile.\n- The shard magic is just... overload, there's so many types of spells with no real benefit to using any of it unless it's just to hit flying enemies or see a new effect on screen. It just doesn't feel like it's useful compared to how fast the melee is and how fast you'll drain your MP. Some people may like the variety, I just feel like it's filler.\n- The story is weak, very weak. There are over the top colorful anime characters with almost no real backstory. You just know they made Shardbinders to summon demons to keep the people in line, which is sad and all, but that's not enough. I just don't care about any of the characters I've met so far, although Zangetsu is cool, because Solid Snake, I'm biased here.\n\nAll in all, the game is fun at times, I just can't justify this pricetag attached to it, all the filler without purpose and overly convoluted crafting system/melee types/bullets makes this feel like it's Free to Play, with a steep price tag. Hollow Knight and Dead Cells are infinitely better games for what they are and you can buy both for the same price as this game. This is a $15-20 game, I'd recommend it on a deep sale only, definitely not the full $40 price tag.",Not Recommended
"I am a HUGE fan of this style of gaming - side scrolling platforming mixed with JRPG elements, epic boss battles and a dark fantasy type theme. I have not beaten the game yet but I can already tell there will be excellent replay value.\n\nThe controls are much like some of the classic ""Metroidvania"" games and the feel as fluid as the animations that they correspond to.\n\nThe story seems to compliment the events in Bloodstained: Curse of the Moon without being totally related. Since I've played Curse of the Moon multiple times, I get very pumped to see many of the characters and enemies from shown in 2.5D and it's works (at least for me). \n\nI'd definitely recommend this game. From what I hear, the Switch version should get patches to optimize it but I don't care as much because I love PC and the Steam version is solid!",Recommended
"Bloodstained, as a kickstarted game, not only delivered but apparently has more to come. Or so they announced, but whatever.\n\nIt was getting rather worrisome with so many failures back to back by other companies. Especially during the first reveal of the game using a 3D artstyle, while the original prototype was a colourful 2D. But after playing through the whole game once, I can say that he indeed proved us wrong!\n\nOne way to describe it would be like playing through a cheesy anime, for which the 3D style fits much better. Character stereotypes, dialogue and even the general structure of the story. It is actually rather great, as it sets the tone to explore and fight the demons, instead of feeling intimidated by them which isn’t the point.\n\nAnd exploring and fighting is what you’ll be doing, a lot. And the game knows that. It starts with a sublime learning curve, nice and simple, but not too simple to trick you into a Not Recommended sense of security. From there, after having given you the basics it kisses you goodbye as you are now on your journey towards the next soundtrack.\n\nYeap, the next soundtrack. Yes sure combat is really nice because each demon has their own pattern of attacks, and finding new enemies means improving yourself, and sure exploring can be fun as there’s loot everywhere, even enemies are loot you have to fight to get, AND SURE you get to experience ingenious combinations of level design and enemy placements that complement one another and encourage the player to improve their understanding of the mechanics, but the REAL reason you’d want to move forward is to hear more of this game’s music.\n\nEach area and each boss have their own soundtrack, and they just never get boring. With various combinations of instruments, but primarily the violin and the piano, they set the mood for your adventure, and become the reason for it. Even some of the game’s secrets revolve around finding music. In a way, it’s like playing through an opera. The gameplay just complements the music.\n\nWhile I am obviously drooling over how great a game this is, it is not without flaws, unfortunately. The game has a great attention to detail, but for one reason or another, be it lack of money or time, there are certain things in it that are rushed.\n\nTo start with, cutscenes. Not dialogue, specifically moving cutscenes. They are weirdly rigid and look rushed, very rushed. The weird thing about this particular issue is that the game as a whole is well animated and has a good attention to detail, but the ONLY time it feels cheap is during cutscenes. It feels like they were an afterthought, as I can’t say there’s some kind of clever reason for their bad quality.\n\nNext on the line, basically everything in the last few areas of the game, making the “rushed” assumption more plausible. There’s a lot of copy-pasted enemies, level design gives up and even the story wants nothing more to do with it and just rushes itself to a conclusion. At least the music never gets bad.\n\nThe worst of it though, is that it leaves you wanting more. I was promised a grand conclusion! But it never came… \n\nOu, and there was one weird bug where the storyline did not progress as intended so I had to google what to do instead because the game was supposed to tell me but did not. That was a thing that happened, literally the only bug I encountered and it was salvageable.\n\nDespite such harsh negatives, a game that’s so good it makes you want more of it, even because of its flaws, can only be commended and recommended. Let alone a game which might have single-handedly saved people’s faith in kickstarted projects.",Recommended
"All achivement unlocked. Not all medals earned though.\n\nIf you are looking for Castlevania (notably Aria of Sorrow) , go ahead, BUY THE DAMN THING.\nJust be careful do not overlevel TOO much, or else the boss fight will be way too easy for your first playthrough.\nSadly I yielded in 99.90%, can't finish the map on my own. [spoiler]Oh man, that fucking Santa Hat.[/spoiler]\n\nNote that Bloodstainted: RotN no longer bounded by ""the theme of Castlevania, Dracula, Belmont"", fashions that are not exactly appropriate in Castlevania is now POSSIBLE, including skills, scenery/stage set, etc. (Which CV: Portrait of Ruin handles it with sub-labyrinth to bypass the theme, sort of.)\n\nAll hail to Iga.",Recommended

"Very fun. Lots of weapons, abilities and equipment to find.",Recommended
"Honestly it pains me to have to do it, but I cannot recommend this game.  It is buggy, incredibly poorly optimized in the final fights (so much so the game ground to a halt and prevents me from completing the final boss), grindy as all hell (and not in a fun way), has mediocre weapons (too many of them, and most are shit), has a crappy storyline, mediocre graphics and animation, it crashes, has a boring map, and doesn't live up to what it strives to be.\n\nDon't believe the hype on this one, it is a very sub-par game in every way, and doesn't live up to what the competition can do.  Seriously, I know this one is more vania than metroidvania, but for a better time try any of the following:  Hollow Knight, La Mulana (La Mulana 2 isn't as good), Rogue Legacy, Salt and Sanctuary, Dark Devotion, Unworthy, Castle in the Darkness, Axiom Verge, The Messenger, Usurper, Dust; an Elysian Tale, UnEpic, Castlevania Lords of Shadow - Mirror of Fate, Ori and the Blind Forest, Aquaria, Death's Gambit, SteamWorld Dig 1 & 2, Valdis Story; Abyssal City, Insanity's Blade,or Dark Maus.\n\nAll of those games will give you a better time than this one.  I'd suggest maybe getting it when you can find it for around £10 or less, even if you've played all the games mentioned above (and others too) and are dying for more of that style of game.  For the price of it, and given it is pretty much my all time favourite genre, I can't begin to describe just how disappointed I was in this.  It outlived its welcome by around the 10 hour mark, but I wanted to push on through to at least get my money's worth.  I'll now have to wait and see if it gets a performance patch so I can actually fight the final boss.\n\nHonestly, do not trust all the glowing reviews.",Not Recommended
"This is an amazing game that I wasn't sure that I would like. \n\nAfter the first boss and reaching the castle everything started to click for me and I have been enjoying it a lot. \n\nIf you get good enough weapons and gear in your first run, new game plus is pretty easy even if you up the difficulty.\n\nI did run into some bugs but they were never game breaking. \n\n10/10 would ORDERED again.",Recommended
"I came in as a Castlevania-Metroid veteran, beating the game blind with 99.60% map completion, and beating every boss at launch. I'm a backer for this game and I'm very satisfied with what I've gotten.\nThis experience is roughly 30 hours long in casual play, without grinding very long, but with attempted comprehensive exploration.\n\nGameplay is focused to where it matters, customising how you play and approach the game. The gameplay can be hard or easy depending on your approach.\nWeapons feel varied and don't feel easily useless, and giving you plenty of options.\n\nWhile there are bugs, there aren't enough to pull you out of the experience. I've encountered only one game breaking one where the game hung because I died using a specific ability at the same time. It's not like Symphony of the Night was a bug-free game either, so I didn't think it was too bad.\n\nThe game feels a lot like the Igavania titles of the Konami days rolled into one. If you liked any of those titles, you would enjoy this easily.",Recommended

"Pretty enjoyable. I encountered a few minor bugs that didn't really ruin any enjoyment. Played it with a mouse and keyboard. With the exception of one late game ability and the weapon techniques, the keyboard controls were pretty good.\n\nIt occasionally stops relying on nostalgia for the Castlevania series and has some creative areas/abilities which is nice to see. I'll have to see how the ""13 free DLC"" updates go but on release, the game was enjoyable and kept me satisfied.\n\nIf you haven't played Symphony of the Night or the GBA/DS Castlevania games then you might want to pick this up as it is a solid Metroidvania. If you have played them then it is basically AOS/DOS with less polish and the OOE quest system plus an optional crafting material grind to further power up your shards (souls) and extra Castlevania references.",Recommended

"Finally, after twenty two years the successor of Castlevania: Symphony of the Night (SOTN) has arrived, OMG, this game was worth waiting for!\nI am a big fan of Metroidvania genre and this one hits the spot!\nGenerally, the gameplay is very good. IGA team added special moves to some of the weapons, the fire arms are a nice addition and the story is good. Up to now I am on 3 hours of gameplay and can't get enough.\nThe wonderful soundtrack is Renaissance style and really adds an atmosphere, same style as SOTN (well, the composer is the same).\nBottom line, you like the genre? Go buy it!",Recommended
"It's the same old story. The developer of a popular franchise starts a kickstarter to give us a spiritual successor. He inevitably succeeds and after a long long wait the game comes out and... ... ... actually delivers on everything the fans wanted?!\n\nWell how about that! Throw aside your wine glass! This is a game no miserable little pile of secrets should overlook.\n\nBloodstained: Ritual of the Night is everything a post-playstation Castlevania fan could hope for. Gothic setting, a huge map to explore, RPG style leveling and inventory and most important of all, a badass soundtrack!\n\nStill, I never played Symphony of the Night so I doubt there's anything to make me feel nostalgic and... is that the soul-capture system from Aria of Sorrow? Never mind! Two thumbs up!\n\nHonestly I can't say anything about this game without bringing up its relation to Castlevania. The game wears its origin on its sleeve.\nFrom side quests to avenge the deaths of villagers named after Castlevania protagonists, to the Thorn Whip and Flame Whip weapons (A nod to Simon's quest of all games), to the ability to turn the entire map upside down whenever you please, to the fact you get attacked by this game's equivalent of the Belmonts, Curse of the moon protagonist Zangetsu. \nWho is now missing an eye, has a prosthetic arm and is voiced by David Hayter.\n\nYes, they actually got the voice of Solid Snake to voice this guy. Now that's *&$!ing awesome!\n\nThe only flaw I can see in the game, is a cheap shot concerning a set of spikes blocking your path.\nHow do you bypass it? Why you need the Aegis plate of course.\nWhere is the Aegis plate? Why it's in one of the 2.5D sections the 2D map clearly wasn't designed for.\nSo chances are there won't be an empty space of map hinting at where to look. Why not make me kneel with a crystal and wait for a tornado while you're at it?!\n\nBut aside from that, I can say with full confidence this game has been worth the wait and worth the money put into it. And while we can only hope Nintendo knocked some sense into Konami when they put Simon Belmont in Smash Bros, we can at least take comfort knowing that franchise's legacy will live on in masterpieces like this.",Recommended

"[h1]In-Depth Review - Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night[/h1]\n\nWell, haven't we waited and waited for this one, huh? I promise to try and be as objective as possible, and keep my hype for this game in check. ... What a spoiler, eh?\n\nWe'll grade the game in categories - each weighted to a different degree, to end up with a [i]""genre recommendation score""[/i] of sorts at the end.\n\nWith that said, let's get into it.\n\n\n[h1]Visuals - 75/100 [i]""Good"" to ""Very Good""[/i][/h1]\n\nIn short, the game's visuals are very pleasant, the art style is great, some effects are flashy and pretty, character designs are great - that's about it. We're not dealing with a graphical powerhouse here (read, purely technically speaking the graphics aren't anything special), but the style and designs really put in some work here; overall a visually very pleasant game.\n\n\n[h1]Sound - 100/100 [i]""Legendary""[/i][/h1]\n\nI'd tell you about the enjoyable voice acting, the great sound effects and so on - but that would require me to stop [i]gushing to no end[/i] about this soundtrack.\n\nLet me tell you, I am a picky snob when it comes to music, but... this soundtrack. [b][i]I swear, this soundtrack...![/i][/b]\nReally, the soundtrack alone would make me slap at least an 80 or 90 on this even if the rest was lackluster - but seeing how the rest is of a high quality as well, I can't get around a maximum rating here.\n\n\n[h1]Story - 75/100 [i]""Good"" to ""Very Good""[/i][/h1]\n\nA spoiler-free summary? The characters are very likeable and relatable; I especially like the protagonist, Miriam, who manages to avoid pretty much all of the typical stereotypes surrounding female protagonists' personalities and is instead a very human, ""real-feeling"" person.\nThe story is overall well-written and even pulls off one or two twists way better than most stories do - though it never reaches that ""next level"", and I felt the ending, while satisfactory, was a bit understated.\n\nAll in all - a very enjoyable story that, while it never goes above and beyond, will keep you intrigued and engaged, and is [i]surprisingly well-paced[/i] when you consider that this is a Metroidvania.\n\n\n[h1]Content - 100/100 [i]""Legendary""[/i][/h1]\n\nWhat do I even [i]say[/i] here? The castle and surrounding areas are gigantic, there are plenty optional bosses to fight, rewarding side quests to tackle, secrets to find, Easter eggs to discover, and so on - and that's not even mentioning various difficulty settings, New Game+ Mode, Boss Rush Mode with different courses, Speed Run Mode...\n\n... this game will keep you busy and give you your money's worth [i]and then some[/i]... and even then, thirteen free DLCs are on their way. [b][i]Thirteen.[/i][/b]\nThere's no way I can get around a maximum rating.\n\n\n[h1]Gameplay - 95/100 [i]""Amazing"" to ""Legendary""[/i][/h1]\n\nPhew, okay... the big one!\n\nThis game is such a joy. Miriam controls so well, it's a joy to navigate her through the castle, discovering its many secrets. As far as Metroidvania protagonists and their abilities go, Miriam is right up there - before you know it, you'll be pulling fun moves, finding useful shortcuts all over the place... and then there's certain abilities Miriam gets later on that put an [i]amazing[/i] spin on exploration that, not gonna lie, I don't think I've ever seen [i]quite[/i] like that.\n\nAnd yes, exploration, of course!\nThis is a Metroidvania, and it's one of those very, very rare [i]pure-blooded[/i] Metroidvanias; the world is huge, winding, full of secrets to discover and temporary dead ends to overcome, and the game is not afraid of respecting your intelligence and allowing you to get lost - have no doubt that this is a hundred percent [i]Recommended[/i] Metroidvania open world design, and at an [i]astounding[/i] level of quality at that.\n\nBut this is also an ""Igavania"", so you're sure to smack your way through plenty a demon, gain plenty an experience point and find plenty a piece of gear - and the RPG elements in this game, with all attached features, are just fantastic.\nMost of all, I am impressed by how, despite having so many features and options, none of it feels useless or out of place. This is something many games stumble on... feature creep - when there's just too much unneeded fluff stinking up a game's feature list.\n\n[i]But nuh-uh, not so in Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night.[/i] Igarashi and ArtPlay knew what they were doing, and they knew it [i]exactly[/i].\n\n[list]\n[*]The crafting of a wide variety of useful items and gear is wonderfully integrated into the genre's all-important exploration by making you find the recipes (and the ingredients, naturally) around the open world\n[*]Equippable shards you acquire from slaying your foes give you various kinds of triggered, directional, utility and passive spells as well as familiars, all of them useful in different ways and improvable by finding and holding more of the same shard and by upgrading them with ingredients via Alchemy\n[*]Cooking food items, again woven into exploration via recipes and the search for ingredients, allows you to permanently improve Miriam's stats the first time you have her eat a new one\n[*]The shop is cleverly handled by allowing you to purchase any item that you have crafted before at least once, thus further incentivizing exploration and experimentation\n[*]The variety of weapons and their handling is huge, with each of them appealing to a slightly different style of play; many weapons even offer powerful special moves, activated with special button inputs not unlike a fighting game, further encouraging experimentation and openness to various weapon types and play styles\n[*]Side quests are rewarding and feed back into the rest of the game's features, by means of asking you to either craft/buy/find certain items or slay certain demons - sending you right back into the Metroidvania exploration loop and all the game's other features\n[*]All this is supplemented by a very useful Archive feature containing, as you discover that info as you play, comprehensive information on all the game's foes, items, shards and so on - anything you could ask for to make your journey through the game's immense world an efficient, driven and highly enjoyable one that you are in full control of\n[/list]\n\nAnd that's not even a one-hundred percent comprehensive feature list - and again, it amazes me [i]how well[/i] it all fits together. This is game design done the way snobby schmucks like me can [i]gush[/i] about.\n\nIf I was to find anything negative at all - it is good that the game finds a great balance between respecting your intelligence and nudging you in the right direction, done via hints and ideas given by the game's characters if you decide to talk to them...\n... but there [i]are[/i] two moments in the game where things do get obtuse and somewhat excessive exploration [i]might[/i] be necessary.\n[b]Here, let me give you hints about them to an appropriate degree:[/b] [spoiler]Keep your eyes open for a well... and falling towards the sky along big towers can be quite fun![/spoiler]\n\nBut those are just two minor flaws in what is otherwise a game that is just so... [b][i]designed[/i][/b], and crafted with love.\nAnd did I mention the bosses are just pure joy? Because they are just pure joy.\n\n\n[h1]Replayability - 100/100 [i]""Legendary""[/i][/h1]\n\nAfter all I said about weapon types, difficulties, extra modes, varied play styles and so on... need I say more?\nNo way can I go below the highest score here.\n\n\n[h1]RECOMMENDATION SCORE - 93/100 [i]""Recommended to Anyone with even Minor Genre Appreciation""[/i][/h1]\n\n... [i]what can I even say?[/i] This is not just a good Metroidvania, and it's not just a worthy successor to Symphony of the Night - this is what happens when a game is crafted with skill, love and respect by people with drive and passion, and it stands proudly among the genre's [i]very finest[/i]...\n... and if you have [i]any[/i] liking for the genre, you [i]need[/i] to experience this absolute gem.",Recommended

"Bloodstained achieves exactly what it sets out to be, a Recommended spiritual successor to Symphony of the Night.\nGameplay, Music and Artstyle all feel like a direct sequel to SotN, yet new characters and mechanics, and new designs of familiar map locations, along with the 2.5D perspective rather than the use of sprites like in SotN make it feel distinct and unique. Filled with many callbacks and references, and feels like a real loving callback to other Igavania games. While there are a few issues, none really take away from just how amazing this experience is. I can't recommend this game enough if you enjoyed Symphony of the Night, or any other Igavania games.",Recommended
"Just finished my 100% completion run of this game and man...what a trip. It's been a while since I've wanted to go through with a 100% clear of a game but I was just having a great time playing the game and wanted more even after the credits rolled the first time so I kept going. The game has a bunch of great throwbacks to Castlevania games of the past (SotN especially) while feeling very modern. \n\nIga definitely makes you think outside of the box to progress at certain stages of the game but I really appreciate that, there are too many games today that are a little too easy on their players and don't require enough thought on the player's part. For people who are familiar with the Castlevania series progression will still require thought, but once the light bulb goes off it will feel very reminiscent of previous games in the franchise.\n\nI was able to complete my first play through of the game in roughly 20 hours which included doing 70% of the quests, 95% of the map completion etc. so I definitely did some exploring, just didn't find everything. For the full 100% clear (normal difficulty, haven't tapped into the harder difficulties yet) it took me right around 35 hours. Both of which I feel are great for a Metroidvania style game, lots of things to collect and explore and some grinding was required, but I didn't feel like the game overstayed its welcome or was too long or too grindy.\n\nAll in all if you're looking for a great next generation Castlevania game to tackle it's hard to go wrong with Bloodstained!",Recommended

"I backed this on Kickstarter, and so far it's the only game I've backed that did not disappoint me.  The core gameplay feels just like SotN / DSVanias.  The level design is great, the music is good, and the performance at max settings has been perfect on my system.  The upcoming free DLCs look promising.  I did have one crash, though once in over 30 hours isn't bad.\n\nMy first play-through took about 14 hours, but that was getting 100% map and shard completion, as well as most weapons made and all but 3 passives unlocked.  Hard and Nightmare difficulties add a decent amount of replayability.  Also, backers got the IGA DLC for free, and it's a nice challenging fight with a nice shard reward, but for an extra $10 I'd skip since it's just the one fight.",Recommended
Just a 10 out of 10. I've been waiting YEARS for another game that came close to Castlevania SotN and it could not be made by any other if not this guy. It's just so damn good I'm being dream deprived for the last few days. \nDon't get it if you love Castlevania SotN and have a life. \n+ things will be added in the near future and for free. \n\nTotally recommend it <3,Recommended

Igarashi really outdid himself. This is a worthy spiritual successor to SoTN.,Recommended

"I'm proud to have backed this great game. It's like SoTN, but better.",Recommended
"I did enjoy the game. I played it and beat it in about twelve hours, and am still playing some of the late game content right now such as item hunting and the quests and things like that. Overall, personally, I was a little disappointed. When compared to older games in the Castlevania series, which this game mostly pulls from, I'd say this is an improvement and a great succesor overall. But when compared to other modern Metroidvania games, like one of my personal recent favorites Hollow Knight, I don't really feel like it is as up to snuff. The game is enjoyable, but it suffers from, in my opinion, trying to hard to focus on the nostalgia of Castlevania and not improving on the formula enough.\n\n	Having said all that, I'm excited to see the next entry in this series, or the next game that Iga plans to make, and I'm glad that he's out on his own. I would rather have this game than not have it at all, and I'm very happy that fans of the Castlevania series get a spiritual succesor that they feel does the series they love so much justice. I'm giving Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night, a strong 6/10. I enjoyed the game for what it is, but I feel like it could have improved vastly on a formula that is pretty old hat. I think a lot of fans of older Metroidvania and Castlevania games are going to have a hell of a lot of fun with this game, and I think it could pull new people into the genre, but I would personally recommend games like Hollow Knight over this as a starter Metroidvania.",Recommended
"Unlike the debacle that is Mighty No. 9, Iga and his crew actually delivered! Fans of Castlevania: Symphony of the Night, Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night is the spiritual successor you have been craving for all these absent years. For those who helped back this kickstarter project, pat yourself on the back. You guys did good supporting Iga and his vision to bring back what made the metroidvania genre so compelling to begin with.\n\nThe only people who will turn their noses at this game are either already dead set on ONLY accepting games like Hollow Knight, or have never played a proper Metroidvania game in their entire life.  If you were on the fence about this game, or remotely interested because hearing the trailer music reminded you of moving Alucard throughout Dracula's castle, do yourself a favor and buy this game already. It's worth whatever price you pay.\n\nIgavania is back, baby!",Recommended

This game has managed to keep my attention for almost 20 hours and I've not even gotten 100% map completion yet. It's everything i could have wanted in a spiritual sucessor to castlevania and more. there are some gripes ive had but have been more my own doing instead of any fault with the game (in my eyes). but if its not a gamestyle you do not like (ya know bunches of backtracking and grinding to clear things with ease) then id say stay away. but if you like the Metroidvania/IGAvania (as its called here) style of gameplay then give it a try.,Recommended

"Igavania. Reminiscent of those classic Castlevania games some could be familiar with. I've backed the kickstarter a few years ago and it's finally nice to see it come into fruition. The story itself is short if you're just speeding through it (or maybe not dying), but there's various things to do and collect for those interested. There isn't much to really say that probably hasn't been mentioned or pointed out by someone or other. Also, as I've been watching the developement process, I'm just content with the final product received. I've received this on multiple platforms, and seeing all the little details put into the game makes it feel all the more whole. The mix of 3D with the classic 2D side scrolling brings an odd harmony of modern to nostalgia. If I have anything to complain about however, is the text style really doesn't match the game. It could be for accessibility, as it stands out a lot, but it just don't seem to fit the style of everything else. Otherwise, a comeback classic, especially for anyone that remembers these types of games.\n\nSave whenever you find something you want to keep, and always carry potions.

"If you liked Symphony of the Night (or the other Nintendo DS titles), you'll like this. 5/5.",Recommended
"I was really hoping this game would have been closer to Harmony of Despair. What I got was a retelling of SotN with elements of DoS sprinkled in. I can't fathom a co-op component will work well with the cramped environments especially on harder difficulties where enemy numbers increase. PVP will likely be a generic Smash Brawl style event with 4 people but there will likely be stock characters to make it fair. As much as I wish for Dark Souls style online system, this game only has 16 hours of content so it lacks the depth for replayability beyond NG+.\n\nThis game has bugs and will continue to get updated after I leave this review, but as it stands this game was hurried and under cooked.  I will reserve total judgement until I see what gets added. \n\nAs it stands, this game is worth the price for the experience.",Recommended

"Took me about 34 hrs to 100% this game on normal, yea it's good. Had some technical issues like Craftwork just standing still during the boss fight and dialogue text missing, but these are the only ones I can think off the top of my head. This is the first igavania game  I've played and the second metroidvania I've played in the past two years, and the game was a little bit too easy on normal (you can basically beat every boss just using spells or grinding for the highest damage weapon you can craft). Definitely going back and completing the game on higher difficulties, but had a great experience, very much worth the price and wait.",Recommended
"Compared to SOTN the game is pretty mediocre. It looks like an OG Xbox Remaster, and rough 21:9 support. I didn't care for the game's art direction, or enemy designs at all. I was a Kickstarter backer and I feel pretty let down. I am never backing a game on Kickstarter again.\n\nI guess the game is kind of fun, at least, and the music is awesome. Wait for a sale.",Not Recommended
"Having been a part of the Kickstarter campaign, I was confident from the very beginning that IGA would deliver. Castlevania: Symphony of the Night is the game that got me into Metroidvanias so I felt like I needed to do my part to see that this game got made, and goddamn I'm so glad I did. Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night is everything I could've hoped for and more - on par with Super Metroid, Symphony of the Night, Ori and the Blind Forest and even (dare I say it?) comes very close to the perfection that is Hollow Knight. The gameplay is smooth, responsive and exciting. The graphics are beautifully gothic, an amazing mixture of fancy and demonic. Each area of the game very much has its own personality and they're all aesthetically unique but feel like they belong in the same castle. The RPG elements are on point, giving you a sense of character progression even as you're progressing further and further into the castle! The amount of equipment, abilities and customization options is staggering. And with 13 free DLC's on the way, I feel that I got my money's worth and much, much more. The 5 year wait was well worth it. Thank you for this gem, IGA and company! You've done it again!",Recommended
"Just finished my first playthrough.  Not much I can add to all the other reviews, they pretty much nail it.  It's such a great game.  Only encountered 1-2 small bugs--nothing ground breaking and were pretty easily avoided, but figured I'd mention.  This game is easily a 9/10 for me, but it will come down to whether you like this style of game.  Chances are if you're even on the fence, you'll likely enjoy it.",Recommended
"First off, thank you Koji Igarashi, although it took longer than expected, you created another masterpiece. \n\nSo, I would normally not write a review, but as a Kickstarter and after seeing some of the negative comments (which is to be expected) I felt I should write my own review, to counter a lot of complaints. Not to mention this game certainly deserves a review from an actual old school Igavania gamer.\n\nTo begin, I felt I should mention first and foremost, this is 200.6% a Vania game that evolves Castlevania: SotN into a modern, beautiful and nostalgic game; Igarashi stayed Recommended to many original concepts of the Castlevania series, and showed games can be modernized while keeping a lot of the nostalgia. \n\nNow I've seen a lot of complaints about others being allowed to buy the game, along with the DLC that were not kickstarters, a survey went out to kickstarters asking what we would allow (yes they asked US kickstarters) what we preferred in a survey https://bloodstained.forums.net/thread/3084/bloodstained-feedback-survey-results for anyone that wants the proof... so any Kickstarters complaining about this, you clearly didn't care enough, and probably never even did the survey. Who would have thought people would be so greedy as to not want the game to be an even bigger success, so we could see a possible future game.\n\nContinuing, I've seen people upset with the content, and how short the game is... This game can surely be beat in a day of playing it consistently throughout, however to 100% the game you would have to put in a lot of time, which includes the quests, map completion, and obtaining everything, including all the easteregg/hidden stuff in the game; I would estimate a full completion of the game at a week +? assuming you aren't cheating, and googling everything. *Possible Spoiler*[spoiler] There is also all the additional characters etc. [/spoiler] Honestly there is more content in this game than $79.99 AAA games, that come out and get beaten in 2-3 hours, I promise you Bloodstained: RotN will entertain you for a lot longer than that if you care to actually ""PLAY"" the game. \n\nFinally, although I could probably hit more key points, I had to mention the complaints about the difficulty... my god this generation of gamers cry about everything, and anything. ""Normal"" is perfect for a old school games difficulty, it feels great, not too hard, but hard enough to certainly make you re-think your strategy; I started on normal just to enjoy the game, although I am a veteran gamer, and could have gone harder, normal was perfectly fine to enjoy the game the way it should be. Thank god Igarashi kept things feeling the way a game should. \n\nI will end this here, however I will add that this game lives up to it's expectations, I would not be here typing this out if I did not feel this way, I am happy with my decision to kick start this game ($100 Alchemist Treasure Bundle). Bloodstained: RotN is worth it for anyone wanting a traditional side-scrolling, Igavania game. \n\nHere is hoping we get a part two, or another game from Koji Igarashi from the success of this game. \n\nThank you again Mr.Igarashi for your masterpiece\n\nShaun",Recommended
"Excellent game. Really brings back the Castlevania Symphony of the Night vibes.\n\nDifficult, lenghty, entertaining, fun, and gorgeous graphics that don't require a monster PC.\n\nIn a time where AAA games bloated with hints, tooltips, tutorials and streamlined mechanics that make you feel like you're playing the exact same game under different developers, there comes a breath of fresh air, brought by the japanese, of course.\n\nDon't expect any handholding, but do expect a bunch of fun and excitement in a game that feels from another time, when devs focused in making it fun, rather than making it ""right"", or even worse, ""righteous"", as some western devs have recently used videogames to spread their political opinions that, personally, I couldn't care less about.",Recommended

I have been a fan of Castlevania since the NES and SNES days. The game that stood out for me throughout the years was Castlevania: Symphony of the Night. My second favorite was Aria of Sorrow. My third favorite was Order of Ecclesia. What this game did was create a mixture of those three games heavily while adding many neat concepts like alchemy and SO MANY WAYS to tackle the game with spirits and weapons. There are just so many different ways to play it and I thoroughly enjoyed it as a Castlevania fan.\n\nI look foward to the DLC and extra content they are releasing for this game. Koji Igarashi and the rest of his teams did an amazing job with the game on PC. If you like Castlevania or a good metroidvania style game you cannot go wrong with this one.,Recommended
"bloodstained isn't a particularly orginial game. pretty much every aspect of it is aped from the SOTN and GBA/DS era of castlevanias, but it does everything so well. the castle is fun to explore, the boss fights are enjoyable and the variety of weapons and shards is great. i've enjoyed tons of metroidvanias over the past years, and ritual of the night is easily up there with the best of them. that said, the graphics are admittedly pretty ugly (though some of the areas have some nice art direction) and there's a couple of points where progression feels a bit needlessly cryptic.",Recommended

The writing could use a bit of work, but it is at least a decent improvement from the days of Castlevania. \n\nThe game is not frame locked which I hope is marking a standard at this point as no game should be coming out in 2019 with such an archaic restriction.\n\nThe trailers really don't do the gameplay justice. Ritual of the Night is unbelievably smooth to play, rivaling the likes of Symphony of the Night and Hollow Knight.\n\nShould you be attempting to find the Recommended end, the game really could use a couple more hints. Finding a way underwater and finding the way to surpass the normal ending are extremely precise tasks that involve doing the same thing multiple times without any knowledge that it will change anything.

"Rock solid Metrovania. Not as good as SotN, but on par with the DS Castlevanias. Oddly enough, it feels a bit like a knock-off of OoE. Miriam is a bargain-bin version of Shanoa. This game does have extensive cosmetic customization that's been lacking in the genre though. I was put-off by the graphics at first, but it starts to grow on you. Aesthetically I would still prefer pixel art, but there's a lot of interesting gameplay things they do with the engine. It's a must-play if you're a fan of the genre, but don't expect any earth-shattering changes to the formula.",Recommended

"As a Backer for this game and waiting for its release, I can honestly say the wait was well worth it. Solid game play and classic feel. Brought back everything I loved from the Castlevania series minus the amazing musical score which is why i will give it a 9/10. If there is going to be a sequel or continuation in this new series I hope that the team works a bit more on the composing since the art, game play, story and mechanics were all on point. Thanks again IGA as someone who grew up playing every installment in the Castlevania series I am glad to have had the chance to experience so many of them again all in one epic game. If you loved the games or are new to the series I highly suggest picking it up.",Recommended
"After four years, Bloodstained finally made it. After playing Curse of the Moon, i couldn't wait for Ritual of the Night. Now that i have the game and beat it, i do have some thoughts.\n\nFirst off, the story and characters are glorious: Miriam has become a favorite even before launch, and Zangetsu follows the rule of cool. Erica Lindbeck and David Hayter really delivered in voicing their respective characters. Ray Chase doesn't disappoint as Gebel, and Robbie Belgrade's guest appearance voicing OD really shines. The gameplay is exactly how i remember Symphony of the Night, IGA and his team really did fantastic. Ayami Kojima doesn't disappoint with her illustrations; she still has that magic touch, and all the collaborating companies really did fantastic helping IGA finish the game. the team really did show their love for their community and backers, especially with the easter eggs by inputting certain phrases in the name ID. They even went as far as providing shoutouts to various backers in sound mode. For example: when WayForward was brought in to help IGA finish the game, he showed his thanks by putting Shovel Knight in the game as an enemy, plus getting his armor allows players to play the game as Shovel Knight.\n\nHowever no game is ever perfect, so here comes the problems. The difficulty spike is ridiculous, even on Normal. there are some enemies that are a total breeze, but then there are the bosses that are very cheap, like Bloodless's attacks being too fast to dodge and her blood rain juggles if not dodged (zero to death instantly). Certain bosses took a few pages from the Touhou series, making their fights total bullet hell, forcing players to think and react on the fly. there's also certain attacks from bosses that cover the entire arena. Not to mention the fact that certain shards are very broken and OP (Teps Oceus and Shovel Knight infamous for being overpowered), they make all other shards completely useless. Even the boss's shards are worthless since you only get them once and they can't be enhanced without end game resources (with some exceptions). There's also a few bugs addressed, like quest items being lost, and the map coverage locking at certain percentages (eventually they got fixed). no invinciblity frames after taking damage, making players suffer through juggles by bosses, resulting in zero to death moments. Lastly, post game bosses and the fight with IGA himself deliver extreme damage and are brutally punishing.\n\nSPOILERS AHEAD!!!!\n\nAnother issue is the story as well: unless you played Curse of the Moon, you're gonna be completely lost on who these characters are, but at the same time, there's no connection between the two games. in Curse of the Moon, the characters were allies, but in the sequel, they became enemies, and there's no context explaining how this happened. Also there's no pay off to the consequences of absorbing a large number of shards. There was artwork showcasing Miriam being corrupted by her crystal from absorbing too many shards, but there's no payoff to that consequence; in other words the game straight up lied, there's no worst ending for Miriam becoming corrupt.\n\nPros:\n+ IGA's finest game. Truly captures Symphony of the Night.\n+ Excellent voice cast.\n+ Many call backs to his previous works.\n+ All Castlevania tricks (Koji Kombo and enemy footstool) work.\n+ Lots of love and dedication to and for the community, including actually listening to feedback.\n+ End game content for replay value.\n+ Not reviewer friendly, meaning NO EASY MODE FOR REVIEWERS. (a big F U for reviewers and critics, and i love it!!!)\n+ FIGHTING IGA HIMSELF IN HIS OWN GAME!!!! O_O\n\nCons:\n- game breaking bugs (eventually patched).\n- exclusive weapon techniques, no universal weapon crushes. only certain weapons can perform more than one technique (Zangetsuko can do two while some katanas can do either one or none at all).\n- Story is disjointed and separate, no connection to the previous title except for familiarity.\n- Constant grindfest for better equipment and resources.\n- certain infinite grinds got patched out.\n- broken and OP shards make all other shards worthless.\n- Not enough multiple endings, discouraging potential outcomes.\n- Post game bosses are brutal and punishing. IGA shows no mercy.\n\nFinal rating: 9/10. so much good things to overlap the bad things. Truly a night to remember and relive.",Recommended
"This game is simply amazing. It's been a while since i got this invested in a game. Everything from start to finish is just great. The graphics, the music, the story are all pros to me. And really there is not a single thing to this game i would say is a con. Only that i  wish the story would lasted much longer, so i get to keep going. I hope this game does great. So hopefully we get another Bloodstained game in the future, plus a nice big middle finger to Konami for not letting him make these type of games in the first place.",Recommended
"Up until now, Dawn of Sorrow has been my favorite Castlevania game. It dethroned Symphony of the Night because of the sheer amount of items to find, souls to collect, and places to explore. Now that Bloodstained has finally been released, and I've played through the game, I can safely say that this new spiritual successor to one of my favorite franchises has topped my list, dethroning Dawn of Sorrow.\n\nMore than anything else, Bloodstained really does feel like the next _____ of Sorrow game in the Castlevania series. The souls have been renamed ""shards"", and some of the enemies and weapons have minor face lifts and name changes, but aside from these surface modifications, everything that you love about the old 2D Castlevania games is here. (Even my favorite weapon, the double sword that is thrown out in front of you and then spins back like a boomerang.)\n\nIn short, if you like 2D Castlevania games, Bloodstained will not disappoint. It retains everything that makes those games great, but unfortunately, it also retains their shortcomings. There were a few times when I got completely lost as to where to go next, and had to wander for a while, searching. Some of the game's more arcane mechanics could've been explained a bit better, as well, such as the fact that once a Yellow Shard is upgraded to level 9, it becomes a permanent enhancement, equipped or not. Its possible that I just missed this explanation, though, so I'm not too worried about it. A quick search online brought me the information.\n\nAll in all, its one of the best games I've ever played, which is saying a lot if you look at my library. I sort of forgot how great a ""Recommended"" Castlevania game can be after playing other Metroidvanias for the 15 years since Order of Ecclesia. Bloodstained brought me right back to that feeling, and it was completely worth the wait.",Recommended
"Bloodstained is extremely good. It's definitely towards the top of the Metroidvania tier list, and I'm seriously debating putting this over ANY of the Castlevania games.\n\nFor what it's worth, the gameplay is like a mixture of Aria/Dawn of Sorrow and Symphony of the Night, with the main focus being Shards being the analogue to enemy souls from A/DoS and weapons having different techniques ala SOTN. It's further amped up by the introduction of 5 equippable shard types (not counting ability shards) and even MORE techniques. \n\nThe map is big, like bigger than any Castlevania yet, and that's including SOTN's stupid inverted castle gimmick and there's a wide varieties of areas with enemies. Enemies are more or less your standard Castlevania affair, with a variety of enemies unique to map areas. \n\nThe difficulty of the game however is probably the biggest distinguishing factor from most of the Iga-Styled Castlevanias. With the sole exception of Order of Ecclesia and Circle of the Moon, almost all of the GBA/DS Castlevanias were incredibly easy. SoTN was even easier. This game is not. It's actually quite difficult.\n\n1000% recommended.",Recommended

"[b]The Good Stuff[/b]\n\nBloodstained is a solid metroidvania game. It controls and feels like a metroidvania game and has features you would expect from metroidvanias, namely:\n\n[list]\n[*] You have all your standard moves, e.g. backdash, double jump, slide, etc.\n[*] There is lots of weapon variety and items to find\n[*] All monster have specific drops with different drop chances\n[*] Most monsters drop unique shards that bestow different abilities (similar to Aria/Dawn of Sorrow)\n[*] There's also boss medals for defeating bosses without taking damage\n[/list]\n\nThe game plays very safe with the way it panders to Symphony of the Night fans. There are plenty of secrets and designs that mimic almost exactly what can be found in SotN. Given the age of that game, however, this is not necessarily a bad thing and at least I could appreciate all the references.\n\n[b]The Bad Stuff[/b]\n\nBut, it's also not the best metroidvania game. Overall, I felt vey satisfied after getting all the achievements and all boss medals in the game, but there were several things that were not quite that good:\n\n[list]\n[*] 3D graphics do not quite work. It works better than you'd expect, but there are some problems in platforming and monster hit boxes, since 3D graphics are not always that functional in 2D platforming.\n[*] To me, metroidvania bosses are about patterns and mastering them. This game, however, have many bosses that do not have distinguishable patterns or tells and getting boss medals turns more into cheesing than learning.\n[*] That said, the game is pretty easy to break. There are number of shards that simply do ridiculous amounts of damage and boss fights turn into quick ordeals as you dish out unreasonable amounts of damage.\n[/list]\n\n[b]Summary[/b]\n\nIt's an enjoyable metroidvania game that is easy to recommend to any fan of the genre. It feels like it should and plays like it should. I just wish they had spent a bit more time in the boss encounters and game balance. While the game certainly doesn't look bad, the graphics look a bit generic and doesn't really set the game apart.\n\nI certainly hope to see more of this series in the future.",Recommended
"I only have a few hours in, but coming from a massive fan of the Metroidvania genre and all the Castlevania games that fall under this category I can say this: buy this right now.

If you like exploring, finding awesome hidden stuff, battling bosses in the style of Casltevania, or if you just like Metroidvania in general this game is for you. It even runs perfectly fine on budget rigs, even integrated graphics. You will not regret it! My rig runs everything on Epic by default, and is as follows: Ryzen 3 2200g, Rx Vega 8 iGPU.",Recommended
You start playing and it feels like castlevania right away.\nExtra plus for the japanese audio language.,Recommended
"Firstly, I need to say that i waited for this game for a quite decent time. I was a backer at the $60 mark, and absolutely love Castlevania, so if you think this could interfere in my thoughts about the game, feel free to do so.\n\n[h1] It meets all the expectations	[/h1]\n\nWell, the game itself is everything it needed to be, a followup to Castlevania that we all wanted and deserved.\n\nIs it the best metroidvania ever made? No, but it certanly is a great one. Its not the best, but was made by the best.\n\nThe long waited years are rewarded by a sharp gameplay, gorgeous enviroments, and a great variety of enemies, habilities, and itens.\n\nVariety is what shines the most in Ritual of the Night. You have a huge ammount of weapons, familiars, and all different kinds of movements and habilities to make use of.\n\nThe shard system is impeccable. The game basically borrows the soul system from Aria of Sorrow and Dawn of Sorrow, mixes with the glyph system of Order of Ecclesia, and perfect them. \n\nStorywise? It is simple, but all the characters are unique and charismatic. The character design is also great, and they certanly hold your attention for the plot.\n\nAnd what about the music? Well, its no Symphony of the Night but it's still stunning. Michiru Yamane and Ippo Yamada made a spetacular job with the soundtrack, which resambles a lot Castlevania. Needles to say, the tracks are excellent, and contribute greatly to the atmosphere of the castle.\n\nThe boss fights aren't all that great. Some of them are pretty good, but others are just forgetable.\n\n[h1] Conclusion	[/h1]\n\nIn general, Bloodstained Ritual of the Night is a step forward for the genre, showing not only Konami but the world that metroidvanias are here to stay. The passion and the talent of Koji Igarashi and his team are evidenced as the long wait is rewarded with one of the best igavanias ever made.\n\n[h1] Thank you Koji Igarashi	[/h1]",Recommended

"Its been to long since I've enjoyed a nice Castlevania like adventure. The game has a vibe much like the Circle of the Moon series.

I'm sure these issues will be addressed soon.\n\n-No explanation on stats, item pickups, skills etc. (Yes game gives stat info but doesn't always explain some features).

"This game is amazing. \nIf you want to feel like back in the days with your nintendo DS and Castlevania, this game is exactly what you need.\nIt literally feels like an modern sequel to Castlevania: Dawn of Sorrow. \n\nBut if you don't like easy games, don't choose normal difficulty. Use a cheat code in the save file for Hard or NIGHTMARE. \nAlthough I don't recommend going for NIGHTMARE on your first run, since it's a heavier dark souls experience than dark souls. \n\nTook me around 60 hours for 100% Achievements on NIGHTMARE difficulty. I'd assume on normal you could do it in around 30-40 hours.\n\nDLC is only one boss and one item, so don't buy unless you really want to.",Recommended

"I am a backer to this glorious game. On my second run and it has only been out a week and a half. Took me 20 hours to beat the final boss, however, to complete it at 100% I would have to spend around 30 to 35. I play mostly on Xbox, but I started a run here and am in only 2 hours and loving it as much as the first time. This game was worth the wait, and gives justice to the genre. IGA does not disappoint. I can't wait for the next  bout of free DLC, part of 13 free DLC to come. 10/10. I would put it up there with my favorites, SotN, and OoE. Here's to another.",Recommended
"IDK man,....I beat SotN at least 20 times...this..it's amazing...it's just what I wanted..the sound,the look, the feel...it's what I thoght it was gona be but better...just good. Just Better. It's on point. it just gets better n better.  one more thing...the Music..Yes..just Yes...Yes.",Recommended
"First off let me just say right off the bat I love this game. I played the game offline most of the time so my friend could play with me on his computer, so that is why is says I've spent 11 hours on the game, but I've actually spent like 40 hours on the game. I beat the story once but I've 100% pretty much everything. Right now I am working on getting the last couple of weapons to have 100% of the items and then I'd have every achievement. \nYou didn't come here for that though, so let me get into why I love this game. This game reminds me of Castlevania Symphony of the Night and a couple of other Castlevania games a lot, and it's obvious why. I mean Iga did an amazing job capturing what was once Castlevania. He made a game that felt like Castlevania SotN, but also combined elements from the ds and gameboy games too for the shards system. I loved all the ds and gameboy games, so this addition was approved by me. \nThe story might be cliched but honestly I was for it because most of the Castlevania games don't have too much of a complex story. Go fight mosters/demons to get to Dracula, possibly find a secret good ending or get a bad ending. In this game the story was very simple. Gebel is now evil, go fight demons to get to him and save the town and get rid of the castle. The combat system is also like the old games and may show age but is still great. You have many weapons to choose from, and you can pretty much use any weapon you want throughout the game. The music was written by the same composer of Castlevania SotN, and so it is amazing and reminds me of that game, but also feels fresh and new. The music in SotN was amazing and I love to this day, so Bloodstained getting this right was an amazing feeling to have when hearing the music throughout the game. The whole map itself was also close to the feeling of exploring the map of the Castlevania games. Go right into it, then find some areas you can't do right away, fight a boss, and then find an ability that helps you progress. You end up backtracking a lot to find where you should go, but you eventually find that area you couldn't reach just yet is now available to you. It isn't all given to you too. You have to do some of the work to get there, the game doesn't just go ""Remember that area earlier on? Go there."" You have to find it after gaining the ability, and that makes it all more satisfactory when figuring it out. The townspeople in the game too remind me of the ones from Order of Ecclesia where you go and do a ton of side quests for them as you play the game. There isn't as many as there were in that game, but they are still there and add to the experience. The crafting system and food system was a surprise and a twist on the formula, and added something new to this game. It added many different items and weapons that you can craft throughout the journey. The food system was unique to where if you craft a food and eat it, it would give you permanent boosts like more hp or mp, which was an incentive to make them all. However I've only said good things about the game, so lets go into the bad.\n I personally didn't like the amount of items because you had to grind a lot for them and it felt like the game has been extended a ton just for it. Granted in Castlevania it had you grinding enemies a ton, but that was an aspect I was hoping to be improved. Granted I didn't think they'd get rid of it, I just felt the improvement would make the game a little more enjoyable. Just adding higher drop rates for materials from enemies would make the process of making all the weapons and foods all the better. Castlevania has low drop rates and made you grind the enemies for quite a bit if you were unlucky. However, even though it is the same in Bloodstained, I am used to it so I can somewhat overlook it, it just feels a little annoying. They also added a technique system to the game so you have special inputs for certain weapons to do cool moves. There are 23 in the game, and I feel like most of them are copy and paste inputs just for different weapons, and throughout the game I felt no need to use any of them, they were just there if you wanted them. They felt like they were just stuck on to the game, and is not really needed at all, but that is fine. It was just a little lame when I realized you could master them and I had to master them at the end of the game because I hadn't really felt the need to use them throughout the game. They were just basically cool moves to use with the weapons. They do however add some strategy for some of the weapons, like with daggers you could throw them and for one of the special weapons, you could send a huge projectile out towards enemies, so you didn't have to get so close with the weapons. It just wasn't fully necessary, and maybe others might enjoy it but to me it was kinda lame. Another thing to note is that there are a lot of weapons in the game which kinda was all like each other and felt like a little too much when having to craft them all. I haven't even finished all of the weapons, I only have like 10 more to make not even, and I feel annoyed with how they all kinda just make stronger versions of each other, but the process to make them is tedious and long, so the excitement for making a weapon is lessened when you know you are just gonna get another version of the weapon, just a little stronger. Other than that I had nothing else I found bad about the game.\n\nThe review is really long now so I gotta do what others do and sum up everything if you don't wanna read all of it\n\nThe Good:\n-Felt like Castlevania, the game this was based on\n-Story was good to me, may be cliched but I still enjoyed it and it stayed Recommended to Castlevania style\n-The music was amazing and was well written, the composer did a great job\n-Work to progress, not spoon-fed to you\n-Side quests were like Castlevania: Order of the Ecclesia and were done throughout the game, and weren't too hard, but still an enjoyable part to the game\n-The crafting mechanic was new and fresh and was mainly the most unique part of the game\n\nThe Bad:\n-Possibly too many items\n-A lot of grinding enemies like old games, and did not improve the low rates for dropping materials\n-Crafting and cooking is a lot less enjoyable when you have to grind for the materials for a long period of time\n-Techniques feel like something not necessary and just kinda added, they don't add much to the game\n-If you didn't like Castlevania SotN or and of the gameboy or ds games, you probably won't like this game\n\nI hope you enjoyed my review.",Recommended
"Even though it's not part of the franchise, this is the Castlevania sequel fans have been waiting for.\n\nOut of all the Castlevania games, Bloodstained Ritual of the Night plays most like Dawn of Sorrow, so if you were a big fan of that title, this is a must have.  If you missed that title, this is a great opportunity to pick up what you missed out on.\n\nFantastic game overall.",Recommended

"Amazing game. Worth the wait and with more content to come. A Recommended spiritual successor to Castlevania one of my favorite series of all time. This bring back everything from all Igavania style games into a complete masterpiece. Don't read more, play it.",Recommended
"Ritual of the Night is Castlevania in spirit. Though the aesthetics stray a bit form the gothic roots of the series, the gameplay is pure Castlevania: You're tasked w/ making your way through a towering maze-like castle constructed from various themed sections. You acquire a variety of weapons, powers & mobility enhancing abilities as you progress & open more & more of the world.\n\nThe story involves demons pulling a castle out of hell with the aid of one of two remaining ""Shardbinders."" Humans w/ demonically charged energy crystals alchemically fused to their body, granting super human abilities. You play as the other Shardbinder, her condition allows her to absorb the energy of the demons she slays (a'la Soma Cruz's Power of Dominance from Castlevania) in order to gain magic attacks, defensive spells, passives, familiars & all sorts of other powers. The journey starts w/ a quick tutorial level on a ship & off you go.\n\nWhere's it break from the Castlevaina formula? The new stuff? Crafting equipment & cooking using alchemy & material drops from enemies. Guns are more prevalent & can utilize multiple different ammo types.\n\nProblems? Some minor bugs here & there, some areas might need a little polish, but nothing horrific. I was disappointed that the whip weapons weren't the ""Castlevania style"" whips that can be manipulated & swung around via directional controls. The kickstarter portraits & demon pets (backers could pay to have their pets become enemies in the game) all over the place are kinda distracting in a funny way, though the devs have put considerable effort into attempting to make these things fit into the world. And some weapon classes don't have any good weapons (I haven't found a good gun for example). But no big game ruining stuff.\n\nThe game is a reincarnation of the Castlevania formula (or at least Koji Igarashi's version of it), but you don't have to be a Castlevania fan to enjoy it. I'd say the price is quite generous, especially considering there'll be additional content that'll be added to the game later: 2 more playable characters, campaign modes, online multiplayer modes, boss rush, a roguelike dungeon level. I'm impressed with what I've seen so far & will be even more impressed if they manage to actually get all the promised content into the game without anything going horribly wrong.",Recommended
Not really a review. Just wanted to say it's a very good metroidvania game and that this game has turned into one of my favorite games of all time. This game has turned into what i wish it was going to be. My only criticism is that there is only one outfit that changes your look/ you can't wifu Miriam (protag) that much. 20/10 will buy this game on every platform because i like it that much.,Recommended
"The game did crash a few times. Even if it doesn't crash, I can't run any other games unless I force shut down my computer after playing this game (it doesn't let me reset). The invert shard only works 1/6th of the time. Farming is mandatory.\n\nI have a lot of fun playing this game. Just don't get it on PC, its too dangerous.",Not Recommended
"Ugh, I love this game. Like many who've kickstarted this title, it draws straight from the type of game play that you would come to expect out of a post-Symphony of the Night Castlevania that Igarashi would've done if he was still at Konami, developing these games. \n\nAnd now, the man has split off on his own direction, to prove that there's still a demand for his type of game. And boy, does he deliver (at least, in my opinion).\n\nLet's get this out of the way first: story-wise, the talking portraits need work.The team behind the game worked very well on cleaning up the in game graphics, but the talking portraits are pretty meh. I hope they work on them in patches and improve the quality of the storytelling. There are numerous typos and wrongly-typed dialogue lines in some of the work, and a bug involving drops being stuck in midair against floors and walls. It's a minor inconvenience, but hopefully that could be addressed.\n\nThe story is pretty typical fare and not groundbreaking or anything: girl with some crazy supernatural powers gets put to sleep. 5 years later, she wakes up and finds her big bro has gone crazy. It's up to Miriam to stop him from rampaging across Europe and utilize the power of the demons. You'll find tons of Japanese pop culture anime tropes in the game, but really, you played it BECAUSE you expected the tropes. \n\nAnd the amazing game play of course.\n\nMultitudes of weapons, armor, accessories, shards, game features and a few hidden bosses are scattered throughout the Hell Castle of Bloodstained. This is a game about exploration, boss killing, item making, food eating and power collection. Some shards are better than others, but once you've gone once through or even through the first run, you'll probably be curious about experimenting with different shard combinations and just generally messing with demons, reaching the level cap of 99. If that's not enough for you, you can also get the more challenging Nightmare difficulty after the first Recommended ending run you do, so you can min-max all over again with a greater challenge through the 10-20 hour campaign. And if even THAT isn't enough for you, free DLC is coming, one of which is the ability to play as Solid Sn- I mean Zangetsu, the gravelly voiced demon hunter from Nippon (Japan).\n\nNewcomers to the type of game this is may find it sluggish- maybe it is to someone not used to the type of game play Bloodstained offers, but it's deliberate. It's rewarding. It's fun. Give it a chance, and you won't regret it. This will be one of the best $35-$40 you will spend on a game.\n\nIGA said he would prove them wrong; and dammit, in my eyes, he did.",Recommended

"Disclaimer: I am a slacker-backer of this game.\n\n\nSometimes dreams do come Recommended.\n\nBloodstained: Ritual of the Night picks up where Castlevania: Order of Ecclesia left off and refines the best elements of most Igavania's into a brand-new launching point for a Recommended successor to the Castlevania series. Its honestly shocking how close the gameplay is to the old series without Konami trying anything.\n\nThe two big additions to Igavania is the second analog stick being used to aim Miriam's arm for various attack and utility reasons, and 3-D spiral locations to take advantage of the 3D environments. While neither are super great, they do blend well to the added variety in the game.\n\nThis game has stupidly large amount of customization and personalization options, fitting so many different types of playstyles and letting players customize Miriam herself to an extent.\n\nThis map also is brimming with so many surprises and interesting encounters that it never managed to drag for me. I do feel some area's are on the long side for what they are, while others could've been further expanded upon.\n\nI do have three issue however, despite my near-universal praise for this game:\n- There is a rock where the side of it is really horribly textured (yes, its such a bad job that I am making it a bullet point).\n- A ""throwback"" location reeking of Action-52 game design.\n- The final area of the game.\n\nNone of these issues though are major, and I comfortable saying this game in its current state (as of this writing) is an easy 9/10. There is so much more coming to this game however, so its only going to get better from here.\n\nMany of these spiritual revival crowdfunding campaigns end up feeling like they are just trying to capture the old magic, while Bloodstained has successfully taken over Castlevania's place. Hopefully, Igarashi plans to bloom this out into a full series, and we dont have to be without these gem's for another crazy length of time.",Recommended

This game sucks you in and keeps you motivated to see what is around the corner. Takes the best elements of past Castlevania games and then makes something out of it all its own. Well done and executed. The only downside is that there have been a few random crashes. Running this game in borderless window mode is the way to contain these crashes to just the program.,Recommended
"If you loved the ""Metroidvania's"" of your childhood (or adolescence), you've probably been looking at this game.  It *is* quite a good game, let me just say that at the start.  There's some depth to it now, there is room to get lost in grinding out rare drops and crafting things... You'll probably die a few times through your first couple of playthroughs. Is it as good as SotN?  That's hard to say, to be honest - the version of SotN that I see in my mind's eye?  Definitely not, I spent far too many hours playing it...  But when compared to more recent (updated, in fact) versions, as an adult, I think this compares well in both depth of play and length.\n\nThe Good:\nControls are, as the game description says, tight and responsive.  They make sense, and feel good.\nThe forthcoming content (DLCs) is quite substantial, something I'm looking forward to.\nSome parts of the game are rather imaginative, finding myself saying ""oh, you can do THAT?"" was a nice surprise. The music is good, and while most of the music is somewhere between adequate and good, a few tracks do indeed evoke the feel of SotN (or others of that lineage).\nThe ""RPG-lite"" aspects are quite satisfying; mowing down rooms full of enemies is a great way to really feel the game's progression, even if you ignore the new tools you get through the story.\n\nThe Okay: Most of the rest of the game, honestly.  The graphics are vastly improved over the early backer versions, although I'm still not entirely sold on some art style choices (I think a lot of the character 2.5D art looks a little washed-out, for example). The voice acting is generally pretty good, with some examples being a little lackluster.  The story is decent, not as deep as you might expect from a full RPG experience, but with a few twists and turns.\n\nThe Neutral: The game does not hold your hand and tell you exactly where everything you need to do is, every step of the way.  This can be good and bad, as I think I stumbled onto a sequence break in my normal playthrough, which was a little confusing. There are mini-quests (hunting and the like) which are pretty rudimentary. Crafting is a little obtuse, and there are some minor dialogue/menu problems (longer speech lines require a small scrollbar, for example). I had one menu-screen freeze when tabbing out while loading a sub-menu, but no other technical problems with the game.\n\nFinal verdict on this game:  If it was considered ""complete"" as it is, I'd be disappointed (I should hasten to point out that I backed this quite early on, for essentially $65).  Given that there is substantially more content coming via DLCs, and there is always room to grow (as well as indications that continuous improvements for some aspects of the game), I'm satisfied with it - and optimistic that I'll be downright pleased once more content is added.",Recommended

"Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night:\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nAfter the terrifying volcanic eruption of the Loki in 1783, a horde of demons rapidly set upon city after city and their inhabitants, leaving them defenceless. A solution needed to be found swiftly before all hopes were vanished. The solution came from a group known as the Alchemist Guild. They transplanted crystals with demonic powers into human volunteers in order to combat the demon’s hordes. Many of these volunteers perished in battle, but not before repelling the devilish hordes. Despite their success, those amongst this new breed of humans who were left living, known as “Shardbinders,” needed to be eliminated too, as they possessed demonic powers with the crystal implants. All Sharbinders were sacrificed, but Miriam and Gebel miraculously survived.  However, Miriam fell into a deep sleep. Ten years have now passed, and the demons have returned and taken refuge in a castle. At the same time, Miriam woke up and embarked upon an incredible adventure, known as the Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night!\n\nBloodstained: Ritual of the Night is a side-crawler action/ RPG game developed by ArtPlay and published by 505 games on the 18th of June 2019. This game is available to purchase on Steam, PS4, Xbox One and Nintendo Switch. \n\nAs you start a new game, the difficulty level will be set as normal. There are another two levels of difficulty, Hard and Nightmares, which will be available for selection after you successfully finish the game on the original difficulty mode.\nMiriam’s adventure starts on a Galleon ship where she will need to find a way up to the deck by moving through rooms and fighting several types of demon along the way before reaching the shore, where the castle is located. It’s a pretty good tutorial, showing you how to use the interface and so on so forth. \n\nAs a mentioned above, the locations are basically made of rooms. Most of these rooms will have demons to fight, which will keep you on your toes all the time. Miriam is free to move back and forth from one room to the next, but be aware that each time she re-enter a room, the demons will re-appear, which is also great in terms of levelling up as each time she kill an enemy, she’ll receive experience points.  There are chests with goodies in some of the rooms, so make sure that Miriam reaches them as they will provide either items for crafting, weapons, armour (clothes), masks or other important goodies. She will also come across green and red rooms in her epic story. The green rooms have a large stained glass which gives her the ability to travel back and forth between green rooms that she has discovered within the castle. The red rooms are extremely important as it’s here that she’ll be able to save her process and regenerate her health and magic points. \n\nMiriam will be fighting constantly and acquiring shards by killing demons. She’ll be able to use these shards to access demonic powers. For example, very early on in the game she will be fighting some sort of octopus. After killing it, a shard will shoot into her body and will be able to use that power against other enemies, but it will cost magic points to do so. There are stacks of enemies to kill and therefore stacks of shards to acquire. She can regenerate her magic points by sitting down on chair and breaking items that have a purple globe or light in them. If a purple rose appears after breaking an item, pick it up and it will slightly regenerate the magic points. Otherwise, find a red room, save the game and both the magic and health will be fully restored. \n\nShe will also come across other characters within her adventure. For example, at the village she can talk to Johanne where she’ll be able to enhance shards, craft items and prepare foods. Talking with Dominique will enable her to buy or sell items, and conversations with other people will give her side quests with great rewards if she successfully achieves them. She’ll fight additional characters somewhere within the castle too, but I’ll let you discover that. \n\nBoss fights are frequent and you’ll either access important items to move forward, or skills. \n\nThis game is extremely addictive and must say that I am super impressed with every aspect! I enjoyed the story, the constant fighting, acquiring new shards to enhance Miriam’s fighting skills and how easy and well done the interface is. After 11 hours of gaming, I have only managed to see 30% of the game and I am deadly hooked on it.\n\nSuper artwork and soundtracks. Great story with stacks of enemies to fight and items to find and you can use your keyboard or your gamepad for controls (which are extremely responsive, by the way). I am just blown away by this game - it’s a jewel!\n\nPositives:\n~~~~~~~ \n\n+	Great artworks\n+	Great Story\n+	Super fun and addictive\n+	Stacks of enemies and items\n+	Easy to craft items\n+	Fabulous gamepedia\n+	Responsive controls\n+	Achievements \n\nNegatives:\n~~~~~~~~  \n\n-	No trading cards as yet\n\nAn adventure you can’t afford to miss!

That said it compares favorable with at least SOTN and Dawn, but imo it doesn't even come close to how good Portrait of Ruin was.\n\nFor most of my adventure I did love playing through areas and I loved most of the boss fights, even if I found the bosses hit or miss, mainly in terms of what patterns im learning or just lack luster presentation (sorry duke of gamblers), I did play the game on normal so I didn't really expect the bosses to give me much more trouble, but they were at least on average fun to learn and overcome.  While im on a few positives, I think the Shard system is just a much better version of the souls system from some of the other IGAvania games, I like that you can upgrade shards to keep them viable as you play the game (I used Heretical Grinder to near endgame and the fire pillar the entire time) and while some shards are still somewhat bad i found most are useful enough that I can see people using them. The cooking system allowing you to customize your build is nice and the weapon skills are a neat system and being able to build a robust movelist for one type of weapon with mastery is very fun. They did expand on the ""soul set"" mechanic from the previous games by letting you set a ton of shortcuts, which does help you avoid menus when you need a movement shard, by the end I just had a set that only had the required movement abilities and then 2 combat sets that mostly existed for me to swap between the Katana and Whip weapon sets on the fly just in case I ran into enemies that resisted the whips I used which were mostly elemental.\n\nMy biggest gripe with this game tho is just the lack of conveyance, almost just as bad as Symphony of the Night could end up being, including the ever annoying ""this equip is required for progression"" like the spike immunity armor or a new one being the zangetsuto, which to be fair you can't miss and do tell you what to do with it so while irksome is harmless. the spike immunity armor is a huge issue cause the soul/shard mechanic literally exists to alleviate this problem by making progression necessities consistent so you'd know what to look for. Now I ran into a pretty big issue with the iron maidens you can move with the giant hand boss shard, I actually couldn't tell I could grab them with the giant hand shard cause the white highlights that normally indicate that just looked like a metallic shine, its not as obvious as the stone pillars or the bookshelves since those shouldn't have a shine like that, so I actually didn't know I could use the giant hand to move them kinda hurting my playthrough. I also didn't like that for the water zone you needed a random enemy shard to progress through the water routes and that enemy soul isn't a high drop rate like it should be to make sure you don't have to grind to get it and move on (side note I did 100% the map and didn't find any like guaranteed soul that would've circumnavigated this). I do also think the game could be a little more generous with save points in certain areas cause there are some areas that are a pain to get through if you want to quickly move from one area to the next with minimal shop visits (this issue depends on the area like some areas had some stupidly close together and some had 1 for the entire area). I also didn't like that they reduced how many useful healing items you could carry (5 hi potions/hi ethers) which coupled with enemies and bosses doing a bit more damage than enemies or bosses in the other IGAvanias exasperated the spread out save rooms. \n\nGonna sneak in that I think the OST is mostly great, even if it has some mixing issues, and that the graphics are kinda just serviceable and the game does look good when it decides to, which sadly isn't the most often occurrence.\n\nOverall tho most of my problems are fairly isolated, even if I think some bleed into the entire game, its still the good ol vania gameplay loop and I think the areas where it expands on past mechanics are great but I think it leans too heavily on the fan favorite SOTN for how it should be in terms of design when I wish it took more cues from Aria/Dawn of Sorrow, Portrait of Ruin or even Order of Ecclesia (to be fair it did get a lot from OoE too which I found nice since it brought side quests into the mix and obviously borrows the souls system from Aria/Dawn of sorrow). It is definitely worth your time if you missed this specific style of game half as much as I have.",Recommended

Do yourselves a favor, gift yourselves this game and support producers and developers like these who have delivered the best I've ever played so far this year. \n\nBeing objective graphics are the weakest part and maybe I would have preferred 32bits SOTN style graphics or a little more detailed 3d ones.

Fantastic Game,Recommended
"This game has by far surpassed most peoples expectations. With those expectations so high because this was a crowd funded game, I have to say that the vast majority of reviews are positive. This is with good reason. I remember my first time playing Castlevania: Symphony of The Night and thinking what a marvel it was. It was my first of many future MetroidVania style games and I instantly fell in love with it.\n\nThis game brings back so many memories. It is a Nostalgia trip of the BEST kind. While it doesn't seek to do anything particularly 'NEW', it strives at what it's meant to be, which is a throw back to those MetroidVania style games. It is in every aspect the spiritual successor to Castlevania franchise that it claims to be. In story, in characters, in game play, in every detail. While it does attempt to make it's own way in the franchise, it harkens back to many details that are recognizable from past games in this genre.\n\nI'll first say that I have a decent computer. With it, I was able to run Bloodstained at the highest settings (Cinematic). No small fabrication when I say that the game looks BEAUTIFUL! The lighting, the effects, the colors, everything just meshes together so well. With everything turned up, I doubt you'd get a more vivid experience if you tried.\n\nGame play is solid and polished, probably more so than many of our old time favorite game Symphony of the Night. One thing to notice is you don't have very much push back like in Castlevania titles. When you get hit, you either stand in place or move SLIGHTLY, but nothing like other titles where you fall over or get knocked back or flying across the room, though it happens on occasion in instances if you are fighting a large boss who hits you with a hard swing.\n\nStory wise, the characters are interesting and the story line is decent enough. Nothing ground breaking, but definitely worth digging into. Voice acting is okay, but could be better. That's a small detail though. The soundtrack is AMAZING and you won't be able to stop listening to the tunes.\n\nOverall, this game is a MUST buy! I backed it on KickStarter ages ago and I can tell you that I do not regret it ONE bit. I'll continue playing this game for many months with the 13 FREE DLC coming on it's way as well with 2 other playable characters. There's a lot to do, a lot to find, cool enemies, super tough bosses and an all around challenging and entertaining exploration and action game.\n\nGIVE IT A GO, ASAP!!!!!!!!!!!!",Recommended
"If you like Metroidvania style games, you will probably enjoy this\n\nI never truly beat SOTN but this is probably the closest to a Predecessor to that game\n\nGraphics are good enough for what they are, some may feel turned off by them.\nVoice Acting is decent so far\nFor all the completionists out there, there is a lot to take in in terms of finding everything\n\nI could go on & on about how good this game has been so far\n\nIf 40 bucks is too steep for you, wait until a sale",Recommended

"This is a really fun game if you're a fan of Castlevania, especially if you're a fan of Symphony of the Night. If you're into exploring, finding loot, leveling up and getting stronger through grinding, this game is definitely for you! There is a whole bunch of content to keep you busy for quite some time as you build your character and look for the many secrets throughout the castle.\n\nAs someone who did a complete 100% run here are my thoughts!\n\nPros:\n[list]\n[*]Huge castle to explore with so many hidden secrets.\n[*]Hundreds of skills to equip and play with\n[*]Several weapon types to choose from\n[*]Magic system that is fun to use\n[*]Several ways to power your favorite skills or spells up\n[*]Progression based crafting and cooking system that is very rewarding\n[*]In game archives makes it easy to find ingredients, demons, etc.\n[*]Opportunity to create so many different builds\n[*]Addictive game play that keeps you engaged\n[*]Character customization allows you to create a unique you as you build your character\n[*]Enough accessories to create a bunch of unique looks\n[*]Female Protagonist!\n[/list]\n\nNeutral:\n[list]\n[*]Very little direction is given as to what you need to do to progress your story\n[*]Techniques are there (D-Input based skills) but I never used them until unlocking them for %100 completion\n[*]Bosses are challenging but can just be brute forced by some early game overpowered skills\n[*]There is a huge grind involved in getting %100\n[*]Hundreds of weapons, but most are just tiered versions of the last\n[*]Clothing variations are limited as only a couple items actually change Miriam's in game outfit\n[*]Most accessories will become underpowered forcing you to choose combat ability over the look you've created\n[*]Hundreds of demons, but they're mostly tiered, so you'll have 15 or so unique combat experiences\n[/list]\n\nCons:\n[list]\n[*]The overall story is not that great and is predictable\n[*]Characters that you meet aren't very memorable\n[*]Quest system does not offer anything unique gameplay wise -- it could have just been bundled into the crafting system\n[*]You will be overpowered halfway through your progression (Level 50) and mindlessly unkillable at the end (Level 100)\n[*]Most bosses can be defeated at Level 40 or so, making getting stronger than that pointless other than %100 runs\n[*]Getting some things to max requires you to start a New Game+ which restarts the story\n[/list]\n\nOne thing I definitely want to mention is the core of this game -- the part that's meant to keep you reeled in, revolves around a huge grind. You have to grind for ingredients. You have to grind for money. You'll have to grind for upgrading skills and spells. You'll have to grind to master techniques and, in most cases you'll be stuck grinding looking for the next area in your story. There are hundreds of skills and items that make the grind easier but at 60 hours, even after %100 completion, I still had about 30 hours of more grinding to go in order to truly %100 the game by maxing everything out.\n\nThis was perfectly fine for me but might not be the case for you!",Recommended
"I wanted to like this game, I wanted to recommend it but I just can not. \n\nAs a big fan of this genre and a lover of hollow knight I just find this to be either rushed or poorly designed. \nMany design aspects are either missing or done in a strange way. Like having key items to progress be drops of mobs or hidden in literal corners of the map with near to no hint to them. Platforming is basic as all hell and has barely any real upgrades to it. Combat is slow and sticky as it is impossible to dodge half the time, but also floaty. Bosses are not bad but 90% of them can be beaten via getting boots and stomping on them, or tanking damage in general.\n\nHere is the sad thing. Hollow Knight raised 50k and put out a 30 hour top tier of the genre game with hand drawn beautiful graphics. This game raised 5 million and it is some 15 hour at most average and poor looking game in the end (with half that time being backtracking I find). \n\nIt is not worth the price and there is nothing to do on repeat playthroughs so... if you want a bit of nostalgia then go for it when on sale.",Not Recommended
"TLDR: Broken Combo Controls; Lovely Visuals; Gorgeous Soundtrack; 2/5 Stars\n\nMy first impressions were forever shattered when I attempted a combo within the game to reach an otherwise unreachable ledge. No amount of telegraphing and/or timing made ""Flash Air Kick"" work even once for the first attempt during a couple dozen jumps on the keyboard or the controller. Both of which peripherals work perfectly in tightly controlled fighter games in my library.\n\nIf ""techniques"" are this clunky and this much of a gamble to execute, the game is only half playable for me because I bought the game almost specifically for the combo system. Most metroidvania developers don't fix clunky controls and expect their customers to overcome them as a ""difficulty"" barrier. I don't expect even Iga to scale this wall, but I'm ready to say my foot is in my mouth if he manages to get the dev team to tighten the controls into something more reasonably sensitive.\n\nWhile the almost blindingly beautiful visuals and almost defeaningly gorgeous audio are a kindness, the game is a sweet torture because the mechanics are frustratingly busted.",Not Recommended
I don't know if I can say anything else about this game that anyone else hasn't said. This game has been well worth the way and if you're a fan of any of the Iga made Castelvania games you will be in for a major treat. This is definitely a worthy successor to any of those games. It not only succeeds at willingly acknowledging itself as a Castlevania clone but it also succeeds at standing on its own merits and being its own franchise. I just can't recommend this game enough.,Recommended
I'll keep this brief: this game really is a spiritual successor for the Symphony of the Night-style of Castlevania games. The creators managed to succeed swimmingly in this goal. If you like SotN-type games then you'll almost certainly like this. If you miss Castlevania since Konami lost their gd minds this provides a wonderful substitute for melancholy nostalgia!,Recommended

"Castlestainia: Blood Panties is a game about a girl who's edgy tattoo phase comes back to haunt her, as an older -edgier- man tries to resurrect colored man that he shot in Brooklyn back in the ""80's, for reasons I mashed start too many times to know. Joke's on him though, because best-girl can chug monster spum like a college co-ed, becomes the living embodiment of 'I can shoot cats out of my f**king hands', and chases Edgelord Bob through a series of beautifully crafted 1360's Europe. Plague rats and all.\n\nAs the player, Whatsername, you run, jump, moonwalk, and beat total ass though what I'm assuming is what passed for human habitation given the time period. Think Gateshead, but less of a Monty Python Ghetto. There's puzzles, and platforming, and quests, and WITCHCRAFT, and you can even bake an elderly dementia patient a f**king pizza. All in all, it's a good game. I would rate it.\n\nMechanical Breakdown:\nAudio: Kinda\nVisuals: Reminds me of\nControls: Better PS1 Games\nUI: for some reason\n\nIt's almost like some jagon ripped off and rebuilt Castlevania: SotN, and if can't sense the implied irony in that sentiment then your parents should have never vaccinated you.

"Can't play the game. Was first told it would work for SteamOS, so I purchased (backed Kickstarter). Was assured at some point by email that it would release for SteamOS (this was when support was being dropped for WiiU and PSVita) Then they dropped support, and said that it would work under compatibility layer (libproton, maybe).

"Don't be fooled by the 2D old school nature of this game. Don't even compare it to other similar looking titles, this game is created by a creative genius and it's obvious why Koji Igarashi is the best in the business and his name synonymous for the metroidvania genre. Now, couple Iga's genius game design with music from composer Michiru Yamane, who many might remember from ""Castlevania: Symphony of the night"" and you got a real epic treat of an instant classic in the making. Ladies and gentlemen need I say more? Strap in get ready to be enchanted by a beautiful story filled with old school metroidvania flavor coupled with new daring mechanics. On top of that, the graphics are beautiful and the environments were created with nothing short of passion. It may have taken close to 2 decades to get a second instalment of SOTN, but hell... The wait was well worth it, thank you everyone who pledged, this is proof of the vastly abused saying ""not all heroes wear capes"" You are all heroes to me. \n\nI cannot recommend this game enough to fans of the metroidvania/RPG genre, the music is inspiring and full of emotion. The game is gripping and immersive, the graphics are simple yet very beautiful. Lastly, the icing on the cake, the cover artwork by the one and only Ayami Kojima. This is a triple AAA grade game, and hence it carries a heavier price, but boy is it worth it. Everyone needs to try this game, there is something for everyone and now is the right time if you were too young to appreciate a cult classic like SOTN (Symphony of the night) This game really is something special, buy this game and play it through to the end, you will not regret it!",Recommended

"Disclaimer: I backed this game on Kickstarter (KS) the day it went live. My review is from the view of someone that put money into this game 4 years ago and has been a Castlevania fan for decades.\n\nAnd all that said, even with just 4 hours in the game I can say this is worth every penny I put into backing it. Had I not backed it, I would certainly buy it and Iga's Backpack DLC. Which, by the way, I think is a great idea for KS backed games. You have the option to get all the same extra game modes, weapons, playable characters, extra bosses and such that the backer's got. I can't tell you how many games I did not buy because there were game-affecting extras you could have only gotten if you purchased early-access or backed on KS. I don't mind backers having cosmetic extras exclusive to them, but if I cannot get the full game experience when I purchase (even if some of that experience requires DLC), then I feel the devs don't really appreciate my potential money. Iga avoided that by making the Backpack DLC. And as a backer, I whole-heartedly support his decision to do so.\n\nI've seen reviews where people say this game would have been good 20 years ago but isn't up to snuff now. I disagree. If you look across the current platformer games, Bloodstained fits right in with the mechanics and graphics just fine. This game is a love letter to the Castlevania games that made Iga famous as a game designer. The publishers said nobody wanted this style of game. Iga's KS proves otherwise. With that in mind, you have to understand a few things. Iga has a formula for gothic platforming games. And while he plays with that formula in every game he creates so there is always something new and fresh, the core of the formula is mostly unchanged. And that is fine because the formula works. There's a reason he has an entire genre of games named after this style. If it didn't work so well, there wouldn't be an ""Igavania"" gaming genre.\n\nI like that he's added the shard system. I see a lot of potential for improving my playthrough with the use of the shard mechanics. And even though every game made today seems to have a crafting system, it feels right for this setting. Alchemy always got hinted at in the Castlevania games and now with Bloodstained, Iga finally has a chance to let us play with it in game. As I said, he likes to tweak on the formula and these are some welcome additions for this game.\n\nThat said, yes there are bugs. I challenge you to find a game that doesn't have bugs. Of them, the only two that I have seen is occasional missing words in the dialog between you and NPCs and a single time that my pause screen did not render the head of Miriam and the game wouldn't leave the screen. Neither of these are show stoppers for me. And I'm certain they will continue to fix these and push out updates.\n\nI love that not everything is handed to me on a silver platter. I read a review today that complained about how there are combos that you can't find in books and you just have to figure them out on your own. Oh...poor baby. You didn't play C:SOTN did you? That's how you learned your spells. You just hit random combinations of directions and buttons and if you got lucky, you'd hit upon a spell. That's part of platform/puzzler games. You have to figure things out...work those neurons. If you walk into a boss fight and haven't figured out the weakness of said boss, you are probably going to get stomped. That's part of how Igavania's work. If you know the boss's weakness, they go down pretty easily, otherwise, you are about to be in the hurt locker.\n\nIf that's not your style, then this may not be the game for you. However, if you like Igavania style games, if you played and liked or loved C:SOTN and have longed for more, then this is the game you have been waiting for. Personally, I'm already hoping for a sequel to turn this into Iga's new franchise.",Recommended
"Koji Igarashi does it again. Unlike a certain man behind a certain legendary blue bomber, Igarashi proves that he's still got it and can make a game happen on Kickstarter--not only without it being a disaster--but resulting in a pretty damn fine game. It's got all the castle exploring, gear collecting, platforming, soul stealing, and secret-riddled gameplay that Castlevania fans expect of a game made by Igarashi and his team. Guess what, it's real good!\n\nThere's a couple technical issues I've run into, and luckily they haven't caused me to lose any progress, but they were still a little annoying. \n\nThe only less than shining things I have to say is that some of the presentation is a little wonky. Dialog and cutscene stuff have some kinda awkward direction, voice acting is pretty alright for the most part but there's definitely not enough voice lines for Miriam when it comes to using certain weapons and abilities (causing them to repeat and become a little grating), and whenever the camera pulls any closer than it usually does it ends up not looking super amazing.\n\nOverall, as a backer, I'm quite happy with this game. I'm glad that the Castlevania style lives on and is successful.",Recommended

"Finaly after waiting for years we Castlevania fans got the thing Konami took from us. No more bad God of War clones, no dumb pachinko machines. I can totaly say that im not unbiased here, as someone who played all the DS Castlevania games for hours, and beat almost all of the classic ones.\n\nThis game oozes with throwbacks to these games, beginning with the feeling of the game. This game feels exactly like the last 3 games that Igarashi developed, the movement is very responsive but does take away a tiny bit of control when attacking so that you have to commit to your actions. The old tech like jump attack cancel, where you hit the floor right after attacking, resetting your animation and allowing you to attack again or evade an enemy attack are still there. Double Jump canceling with the dive jump still works, effectivly if you played a modern 2D Castlevania you know exactly how this game operates.\n\nSome Weapons have gotten some changes however, most notably the Whip which no longer hits in a long horizontal swing forward but is instead swung down-forward. This gives the weapon alot more weight, probably my favorite weapon type in this game. IGA did dabble with guns in the latest Castlevania games, most notably Albus mode in Order of Ecclesia. But this is the first game where there is more to it than to just shoot enemys. Ammunition is an actual resource that you have to find or to craft, all with different abilities like debuffing the enemy. \n\nAnother new addition is the already mentioned crafting, which works by simply beating enemys and collecting items from them then combining them. Im not a big crafting fan, but once you crafted an item you can simply buy it from the shop. \n\nAria of Sorrow style soul abilities are back, but this time in the form of shards which you absorb by killing enemys. Almost every enemy has a shard that he can drop with the exeption of maybe two normal enemys and about two bosses if I remember correctly. They give you abilities that you can activate on the press of a button, abilities that you can aim with and of course passives one as well. We also have the familiars from Symphony of the Night back, which you can level up by having them around while enemies die.\n\nOne of the biggest problems people had with the latest 2D Castlevania games was the amount of recycled assets, because IGAs team did not had the funding he needed (thanks Konami). Since Bloodstained has no connection to Castlevania outside of the development team, there are no old assets. There are still alot of enemies which resemble older ones from Castlevania, some even having the same name. Most enemies, however, are new and fun to fight. But the medusa-head dullahans can do the same thing as their Castlevania counterpart, F right off that is.\n\nBosses are kind of a mixed bag, with most having a really cool design but lacking in terms of actual fighting them. They dont do enough damage, most attacks are way to easy to evade and its overall pretty easy to just stomp them without having much thought about it. There are three standout bosses, however two of them feel more like mid game bosses, despite them being endgame bosses. The last boss is a super boss who finaly does some damage and has some hard to evade attacks, but sadly falls into the kind of category where most of the dangerous stuff are badly telegraphed attacks that once you saw them you know how to react next time, still probably the most challenging and rewarding boss in the game.\n\nThe game is around 10 to 20 hours long, depending if you just want to complete the game or to perfect everything in the game (100% Map and Item completion took me around 30-35 Hours but you can definitly be faster than that if you want to)\n\nThere is currently one DLC for the game where you can get a Boss fight and the Sword whip, both of which where originaly for backers only but after a vote they where put out to the general public (a good thing since I only backed the game on console) I can safely say that you should only buy the DLC for the Boss, the weapon is extremely underwhelming and feels like an early game weapon that you get towards the end. But even for the Boss its a hard sell, simply because the fight is not well thought out, but it makes up by having Igarashi trying to voice act which is hillarious.\n\nOverall as a Castlevania fan who grew up with the DS games I can say that Bloodstained is a game which, for me, sits closely under Order of Ecclesia and Portrait of Ruin, but lacking the difficulty these games had. Due to that its definitly friendly for fresh blood but old Castlevania fans will still get an experience they craved for years 100% recommended, had a blast, with some additional content like a second playable character coming hopefully soon",Recommended
https://youtu.be/dMAq65ryQZM\n\nposted a video of the first impressions of the game after playing for about a week. I LOVE THIS GAME. \n\nthank you for all the hard work going into it,Recommended
"Symphony of the Night was the greatest game ever made.\n\nUntil Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night released. If you are a fan of Igarashi's Castlevanias, and Metroidvanias in general, this should be at the top of your list. If you've never played any of them, you should still play this masterpiece.\n\n10/10",Recommended
"This is a Recommended Iga game, and any fan of the old Igavanias will totally feel at home. The music is great, and I cant get some of them out of my head. While some of the songs are not that much remarkable, they all are in sync with their respective environments.\n\nThis game have a shard systems similar to the soul system in the Aria games ( Aria of Sorrow and Dawn of Sorrow), where every enemy in the game can grant you a unique power.\n\nBloodstained allows the player to progress in many different ways. You may want to cook all the recipes and help the villagers, or maybe you want to go plowing every living, dead and undead that comes into your way. You may just grab what is in front you, or you can go hitting every wall and floor, searching for secrets. You can farm an specific enemy for minutes to get something or just make the best of what you already have.\n\nThe history is regular, at best. But the history is not the reason we came here, right?\n\nThe boss battles were great and kinda hard! But dont give up, because they are all based in patterns. And once you master them, you can fight them without getting hit, in an exercise of finesse and A E S T H E T I C S.\n\nI think Bloodstained could've been better with a classic 2D sprite style. While the 2.5D allowed the developers to create amazing backgrounds with proper depth and shadow/lightning, the character models suffers from it.\n\nThe controls work great, the only problem I had was with the techniques, weapon moves with commands akin to fightning games, ala Street Fighter/KoF. I couldnt pull them off consistently, they cost as much mp as a regular spell and they sometimes will put you in ankward positions, like defenseless in midair or near another enemy. I heard katanas are great, though I didnt master all of the katanas techs yet, so I can't have a word on this.\n\nGuns could also be improved. You need to upgrade your ammo capacity, collecting upgrades through out the game. Initially you constantly run out of ammo and needs to return to the village to restock. The basic ammo is infinite, but it lacks damage. Ammo could really drop from enemies, at least to sustain the most common types. This ammo issue can be resolved later in the game, and the gunslinger becomes a beast, also turning all the ammo capacity upgrade kinda useless.\n\nThis game is great as is, and there is more content to come. It is kinda above the price of the usual metroidvanias, but not too much. And you can get many hours of fun out of it. If rush the main game, it will be 12 hours at least. Then you will unlock hard and nightmare modes. While they can be unlocked at the start with cheats, playing them as a second and third run will be most beneficial, as you can select those difficulties in a new game+, which means your overpowered character will have some usefulness.",Recommended
"Iga's return is also a return to form for the genre that once bore his name and gave greater popularity to the ""Metroidvania"" genre as a whole; the game is full of ludicrous and fun set pieces, challenge, and a lot of room for customization -- not only with Miriam's appearance, but with items and accessories.  Michiru Yamane's soundtrack absolutely slays.\n\nHands-down, one of the best games of 2019.\n\nDo *not* pass this one up.",Recommended

"This game is AWESOME! If you ever played castlevania Symphony of the Night, and liked it, then you should buy this game.\nP.S. I love that this game works with steam play on Linux out of the box for me. played through the whole game with no issues what so ever.",Recommended
"solid gameplay, cool atmosphere and tons of mechanics. 10 hours in, seems like iga delivered.",Recommended
"As a fan of Symphony of the Night I backed the game when it kickstarted, and after finishing it I can now safely say that I am pleasantly satisfied. I found a lot of resemblances and parallelisms with SotN and at the beginning I thought that would be a ""cheap"" way of making profit of the nostalgia, but some of them are wisely modified to make them feel fresh. The game is huge and adds tons of customization, progression elements and crazy mechanics. I needed to play a game like this, it was worth the wait! You can see that a ton of work has been put into making this game, also the attention to details and small easter eggs make the game shine. Thank you Iga and Bloodstained team! Amazing job!",Recommended
"I have been an avid Castlevania fan all of my life since The first game released on NES. I have played almost every game in the series, (including some of the unmentionables like on N64.) Symphony of the night was one of my favorites and Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night provided a very similar experience. The visuals, audio, and game play are all top notch and tight. I feel that not only did they make a game in the same vein as the classics I still enjoy from the days of youth past, They exceeded my expectations and created something even better. \n\nThe overall appearance and theme of the game are wonderful, the vivid and imaginative level design, gothic feel, and dark setting all weave together to create a very visually pleasing experience from start to finish. The voice acting cast was good and the conversations didn't seem forced or too hard to swallow. The story was enough to keep the pace going without interrupting the exploration and action too much. The cutscenes all looked good and fit well with what was going on in the story. I was very pleased with the way the game presented it self visually. \n\nThe OST for the game was AMAZING! It really allowed the atmosphere to come together with the satisfyingly varied and thematically wonderful sounds as you traversed the environs. Not many games have scores this good! Really want these tracks to listen too even when not playing.\n\nThe game play was nice and reactive. Didn't notice any lag or weird delays in the controls at all. Everything seemed pretty polished and worked well. The action and feel of combat was super diverse with all of the different options available for building out your character the way you want. I love games that give the player the options to play the way they want, whether it be a magic user, hand to hand combatant, or long range gunner. All of the different options kept me experimenting and playing to figure out what i wanted to focus on and push my characters abilities to the max. \n\nSome of the items in the game are not easy to find, which is not a bad thing in my opinion as it keeps you searching for the next big score. The feeling of achievement when you find a special ability or item in the game is what keeps the power fantasy alive and makes dispatching all those pesky foes so much fun!\n\nIf you are looking for a good game to play that has depth, good story elements, and (if you are like me) harken back to the best games of yesteryear all while providing the polish, style, and tight controls of a modern platform adventure, This game is for you. I look forward to the next installment in this series and give my thanks to all those who had a part in creating one of the best games have had the joy of playing in a very long time.",Recommended
Pretty good game. Decent music (subpar for the castlevania series). Good iteration on the classic castlevania series. It hits all the right notes and feel of a loot filled Castlevania game. Miriam has a fun design. There are plans for more post release content to come out and I fully expect to re-play the game when that content comes out.,Recommended
"Ritual of the Night is the Recommended come back to the origins of the metroidvania genre. \n\nFor those unfamiliar with the gameplay of the genre: think of Dark Souls (especially the first) but in 2d.\nRemember exploring firelink shrine the very first time and going right to the cemetery only to find out that you were not prepared for that area and at some point you probably couldn't even progress because you lacked the right item? That's basically what a metroidvania is: a big, maze-like einvironment with lot of secrets, plenty of diverging paths that sometimes are simply dead end until you obtain the item you needed.\n\nIn the metroidvania case we are usually talking about an item that in some way modify the way your character moves.\nIt's like a lock and key system but much more interactive, interesting and entertaining.\n\nBeside exploration you have an action RPG system with a plethora of weapons, combo and magic, all accompanied by exquisite backgrounds, great enemies design and beautifully composed music.\n\nRitual of the Night is this and much more. Right now the game offers a great adventure of at least 10 hours (but still it took me 18 to get a 100%), customization, new game+, boss rush mode, speed run mode, 2 unlocked difficulties after the first game completion and the creator of the game promised 13 free DLC with new characters, multiplayer mode and much more.\n\nThe game isn't without flaws. To be fair, I could talk about how little innovations there are from IGA's previous games or how the shard/soul system is all in all less appealing than the simple yet greatly effective SOTN system where upgrades were built on top of the others but all in all these are all minor flaws in a truly great game that comes so close to being an absolute masterpiece.",Recommended
"The short: If you liked Castlevania: Symphony of the Night, you will like this game.\n\nThis game is exactly what it said it would be and that is so rare in today's game market. It is basically an updated version of Castlevania Symphony of the Night. If has the exact same feel and flow to it. Very little hand holding. No giant quest arrow saying ""go here"". Only the occasional cryptic hint to make you ponder what it could mean. You could blast through the game super fast in around 10 hours ish, ignoring all the secrets and easter eggs. But, I feel if you do that you totally miss the point of what a Recommended Metrovaina game is. You can spend hours trying to get all of the items that unlock new skills and looks, figuring out where to find everything. The game is everything I had hoped it would be and I honestly couldn't ask for it to be any better.  The skill system is, well frankly, surprising. The amount of skills, wether it be from shards, magic, weapons, or just playing around with inputs to unlock hidden skills, is just AMAZING! SOOO MANY combinations and way to play. Each different weapon class changes the game play DRAMATICALLY and gives you TONS of replay value to master them all.",Recommended
"If I wrote a detailed review I'd be here all day, but YES, a hundred times, YES! Do you like classic castlevania games like Symphony of the Night? Then buy this, no questions asked! \n\nIga and his team have done incredible work here and the love and care really shows. If you're a veteran of the genre I recommend using the cheat NIGHTMARE (input as the save file's name) to unlock the harder difficulties from scratch. After a few hours, you begin to snowball so hard that I felt unchallenged until the late game. \n\nAmazing, Recommended to heart igavania.\n\nAdditional note: It's Recommended, if you're familiar with this genre of game, you may very well find 'Normal' to be too easy. Play on Hard (tougher bosses, more enemies, etc) or Nightmare (Hard but you are capped at level 1) instead, if you're concerned about challenge! Set your name to NIGHTMARE to unlock these modes early!",Recommended

"This game is pretty great, but there are serious bugs. Be aware that when you buy it you might have to restart it all the time.",Recommended
"Absolutely love the game. While I hadn't really paid attention to it up until recently, I've been looking at the news over the past few years. All of the delays, version cancellations, etc have all the warning signs of a Kickstarter project gone bad, but somehow the developers overcame that produced a phenomenal game. 9/10, would recommend.",Recommended

"It's like how I remember SotN in my head.\n\nThis is good and bad. On one hand, I love Castlevania and this game delivers in spades. But play any of the SotN or later titles and you've played this one. Metroidvanias have come a long way since then, especially in terms of story-telling. Hollow Knight is easily a better game than this. So is Axiom Verge.\n\nIt's a great foundation and an excellent homage to the series. I hope the next one can shake up the formula.",Recommended
Top notch Metroidvania with great gameplay and a metric ton of gameplay options. One of the best games in the genre. Highly recommended.,Recommended

"Not a Bad game by any means, Closer to good than bad. But just not worth 40 dollars. not at all. games roughly 10 hours long. games like hollow knight are 15 and salt n sanctuary are 20ish. this just is so overpriced. if it drops down to 20-25 dollars go ahead and pick it up.",Not Recommended
"Beat the game entirely on normal, got all the cheevos. The game meets my expectations, which were kinda modest: that the game would be as good as the DS Castlevanias; it is at least that good. For anyone that hasn't played any of those, this is a platforming action rpg with a continuous map where you look for powerups and abilities that let you progress further. There are a handful of graphical bugs (the game just came out, so I hope they get fixed eventually,) and it crashed three times over the course of my playthrough.",Recommended
"Perfect Castlevania game.  If you liked Symphony of the Night you'll like this.  If you've never played it or anything like it, you'll probably still like this.\n\nPerformance is great, with 4k60 @ max settings without issue on a 1070 and i5 6700k.\n\nGame has a few bugs here and there, but nothing game breaking.   Audio bugged and looped cancer during the last cutscenes.  One boss will bring your system to its knees.  HDR is nothing special in this.  Cutscenes are low budget looking but who's here for cutscenes.\n\nOther than those things it's a perfect Vania game.\n\n",Recommended

"Hi All,\n\nFor years now I have wished to play a new Castlevania game. LoS was okay but it was not 2D nor held the same soul the older Castlevania games had. Castlevania is my favorite series next to Monster Hunter & Animal Crossing and to see Konami kill something I held so dear to me was truthfully one of the most heartbreaking things I endured as a gamer.\n\nBut Now...\n\nAs someone who has fallen in love with Castlevania since the dawn of the series, this has to be my favorite metroidvania style game I have ever played. Iga took every good Castlevania game and threw it together. It is hard to please me when it comes to these types of games (many indie games have tried but failed for me) and I have to say Iga and team has created something BEYOND my expectations. \n\nGameplay: \nThis game features hours of fun and refreshing gameplay that holds Recommended to the old Castelvania games (GBA/DS/PS Era). It is smooth and polished and creates an feeling of pure enjoyment when you play the game. The sheer volume of weapon styles and shard abilities insure everyone will have a different way of playing this game that suits them.\n\nExploration:\nThe games Hellhold is hauntingly beautiful and the environments and enemies they have created are equally as magical as the old Castlevania games. There are more than enough levels in the game to keep the scenery changing at a steady pace. Not to mention the large amount of secrets! You cannot beat this game without exploring every nook and cranny you can find and I LOVE that. \n\nMusic:\nCastlevania soundtracks have always been some of my favorite music to listen to and this game is no exception. Michiru Yamane has done a fantastic job on telling a tale through each level with her music. The songs bring back the nostalgia of the older Castlevania games (she did work on them so it only makes sense) and will have you humming the tunes for days after playing. \n\n100%ing: \nThere are so many things to collect and do in this game. it has taken me 40 hours to 100% EVERYTHING on normal mode. there are a few shards I cannot get until NG+ so once I beat the game again on hard/NG+ I will probably have spent 50 hours roaming the Hellhold in search for crafting material, food, ingredients, weapons, armor, accessories, helms and shards. With lists to help guide you, it is reasonable to 100% this game without wanting to tear your hair out. \n\nIn closing, As a self proclaimed die hard fan of Castlevania, this has to be one of the best Castlevania games I have ever played, But...it is not Castlevania, it is Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night and it BEATS Castlevania in every way. Long live Bloodstained and AMAZING work Koji Igarashi & Team, You truly outdid yourselves and have brought back my love and compassion for these types of games. Never stop developing masterpieces.",Recommended
This game is exactly what I was expecting it to be. A Recommended spiritual successor to the Metroidvania Castlevanias. Also a lot of free DLCs are incoming.,Recommended
"Rich Moving and Skill Sets after 40% game play, can't stop and keep play",Recommended

"Well, I blew my entire weekend, 30 hrs bascially playing this non-stop. Now at 100% and thinking about going in for NG+. \nDon't let the art style fool you into thinking this is shoddy. It's a fantastic game if you have any love for the genre, with tons of secrets, unlocks, weapons etc. Add the freeLC coming up, this is a lot of entertainment for your hard earned cash.",Recommended
"I have to say, this game has some flaws. The graphics, while not being that important, are really unappealing for me, especially the texture work. Getting lost and not knowing where to go next happens way too frequently. Most boss fights are not as impressive, as in CotM for example. The cutscenes are really janky and the voice acting could be better in some places. And the final level looks obviously rushed.\n\n[b]BUT THIS GAME IS SO GOOD[/b]\n\nThis is definitely a worthy successor to the Castlevania series and Iga really outdid himself this time. I soaked in so many hours into this game and I still don't have enough because of all the unlockables I can get, the entire castle I can explore, and how ridiculously overpowered Miriam can become with all the shards and weapons to experiment with. Not to mention all the fanservice for the Castlevania fans. This game quickly became one of my favourites, no doubt. Definitely recommended for metroidvania lovers.",Recommended
Love it! I want to buy a physical copy to have in my collection. \n\nThe game is like the other GBA/DS games. Not like the ones that were later released  I.E Curse of Darkness - Lords of Shadow.\n2D is the only way to play Castlevania/Bloodstained. Highly recommended! I want to back the next kickstarter.,Recommended
Good game i like,Recommended
Sure to become a classic in its genre.  Holy crap it's fun.,Recommended
This game is fucking tight.,Recommended
"Really great game with a few hickups here and there. Game is huge , fun , looks really good and plays good. But there are a few issues. You will get lost as game doesnt exactly tell you where to go or how to go there. Another issue is that when you kill monsters that are on slopes or halfway/fullway inside the wall their drops will bug out and wont be collectible. There are also less teleport rooms compared to similar games that were released previously so you will run around generally a bit more , it does add to the difficulty of the game a bit but becomes a hassle by the end. Overall great game , worth the price and with upcoming features like second playable character , roguelike mode and a few more stuff its going to get better and better.",Recommended
"All the best aspects of SOTN, and only a few of the drawbacks. a Recommended throwback brought into the modern age of gaming. The sound, gameplay, and graphics are all stunning, the bosses are touch but not impossible with the right tactics/gear.\n\nCons? lets be honest, its SOTN 2, what cons? ok ok, ummm...... the story and (some) bosses are basically borrowed from SOTN.\n\nOverall 9/10 if you include the flaws listed......HAHAHAHA! ya right its still a 10/10 play it!",Recommended
You don't need to play the prequel or Castlevania before to enjoy this game. This is just pure fun and well worth my 36$.,Recommended
"This is a fantastic game for fans of Castlevania: Symphony of the Night and many of the games that were later released on Nintendo's various handhelds in the 2000s. Modern gamers who come from games like Hollow Knight, Guacamelee, or Salt and Sanctuary will similarly enjoy this game, although the two former games have far more platforming elements than Bloodstained. In short, if you're looking for a new MetroidVania then you've found the right game. \n\nThe Good: One of my early worries with the videos I saw made the game seem like it played slowly, the controls not feeling ""snappy"" and that the love affair that everyone was having with Dark Souls would creep in. Thankfully, none of those things ended up being Recommended. The game runs very smoothly, the response and feel of your attacks is quick and feels weighty, and the game throws dozens upon dozens of abilities at you and if they're broken and you want to cheese your way through then have at it. The more difficult modes could provide some challenge if you want some kind of Soul crushing experience that you can die at for hours. The graphics are very good for the genre, although the textures in the areas are a bit repetitive the level design keeps most rooms feeling interesting and the Tower of Twin Dragons is a very well done and executed sequence. The variety of weapons is quite large and they all felt viable; accommodating to many different playstyles. At the price tag of roughly $40USD, I was able to get ~40 hours of playtime out of it, and did something I rarely do which is hunt down most of the achievements. I'll probably replay this game again when the 2nd character comes out, and would come back and replay it again after that. I feel like the price is reasonable for the quality and time you're getting. \n\nThe Acceptable: As an RPG, one from the old school mentality, if you come across a particularly hard section you can simply grind  out some levels while farming items/shards and make it easier. Some people dislike this, though I myself love a good grind/farm some people dislike that you can do something other than master the controls and boss attack patterns in order to progress. \nThe music while not bad by any means, isn't particularly memorable. Not every game should have an amazing soundtrack but seeing as this will be compared to Symphony of the Night, a game that has possibly one of the best soundtracks ever, you won't be blown away by it here. The weapon techniques are overall pretty miss, but their inclusion is a nice feature if you want to play around with them. I used the Bandit Blade special technique quite often because I figured it might have a better chance of dropping loot (no idea if it does or not). The bosses were mostly forgettable, with the twin dragon fight being shown in most trailers and the game never having anything better than that. \n\nThe Bad: As of release there were a few bugs and some various glitches, however the game never crashed for me, nor did I encounter anything game breaking as others have. The main glitch I experienced was loot dropping and getting stuck in a wall in it's falling state which renders it unable to be picked up. Very annoying when you're farming but as I was able to get the ""All Items"" achievement in 40~ hours of play, not a deal breaker. \nStorywise, there just isn't much depth. In terms of plot sequences there's probably about as much as in Symphony of the Night but unfortunately none of the characters in this were particularly engaging and the story arcs were fairly generic and simplistic. I'd say the story is 'serviceable' but not much else. \nThere were a few points where I was lost and had to go look on the discussion boards to see what to do, and the answer was usually something that the game probably should have made a little more clear in terms of explaining the mechanics. This could have been a quick fix by simply forcing you into situations where you'd be forced to use a mechanic to get out of a trap or some such, however since you can just check the discussions if you get lost you shouldn't be lost too long. Essentially the issue is that the game gives you some abilities and then leaves it in your hands to figure out how to use them to their full potential.\n\n \n",Recommended
12 hours in and I'm awestruck by how good this game is. This is a must play for every metroidvania genre fan!,Recommended
"An excellent spiritual successor to the Castlevania games, feeling like a long lost sequel to Order of Ecclesia. The movement and combat is well executed, with a variety of weapons, responsive controls and a good repertoire of character abilities. Once you get some key movement abilities, it's fairly fast paced compared to other similar games. There's a decent amount of gameplay here, with a playthrough of its sprawling map taking about 10-30 hours, depending on how much optional content you go looking for. The visuals are mostly decent, with an anime art style reminiscent of Order of Ecclesia. The music is across the board fantastic and memorable. \n\nIt's a little uneven in places, with platforming and combat being marred by poor collision detection and wonky hitboxes. It's an unfortunate inevitability trying to integrate the existing Castlevania design into a 2.5D engine, and would have been served better by changing the existing design or using 2D visuals. Occasionally the game appears cluttered in a way that interferes with gameplay, such as in the game's initial boss encounter, which frequently obscures the action with foreground elements and poor camera angles. Some later parts of the game also seem rushed compared to the earlier sections. In particular, the final dungeons feature some bland level design, an overabundance of reused assets and palette swapped enemies. Occasionally, the path to progress can also be obscure and poorly signposted. \n\nAnother issue is that by default the game has multiple difficulty levels, but they're buried behind either use of old school cheat codes or require a second playthrough to access. There's no good reason to hide gameplay options like this, particularly as seasoned players will likely best be served playing on the hard difficulty. \n\nOverall though it's a fun experience and it's awesome to see a new one of these games, with a decent budget and substantial amount of gameplay. There's been many excellent examples of this genre of game released in recent years, with most being keen to bring something new to players. Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night may have no interest in creating anything novel or updating its formula for a modern sensibility, but neither has any other recent game emulated the success of the post Symphony of the Night formula as well as this.",Recommended
"Fun game, decent graphics, lots of nostalgic moments.",Recommended
Captures totally the feeling of playing those GBA or DS Castlevanias and im in love with it.\n\nBad thing i might add would be that the game sometimes freezes when you do stuff too quickly (Skipping convos and opening menu),Recommended
"After having 100% completed everything in the game. I can say that this game is fantastic.\nGreat music, gameplay mechanics, visuals.\nMy only complaint being that the story felt somewhat predictable.\n\nI see this game like salt and sanctuary or bloodborne. \nThe classic kind of game that i'll come back to every year or couple of years to do another playthrough, having fun with different weapons and shards combinations to run with.",Recommended
"If you love any of the following games: Symphony of the Night, Dawn of Sorrow, Aria of Sorrow, Portrait of Ruin\nBuy this game!",Recommended
Just finished this awesome game! I did enjoy it all the way through. The gameplay is very similar to Dawn of Sorrow and Order of Ecclesia. If you expect this game to be Symphony of the Night you better go and play Symphony of the Night because this game is something new with a different feeling that I find very appropriate for this title. It has some extras that will keep you playing it if you dare to take the challenges.,Recommended

"At the beginning i hold off when I saw the graphic, was hoping it to be 2D metroidvania style. But then still, take my chances and bought it, and am not regretting it ! It really have the vibes of symphony of the night, mix with the element from aria of sorrow/dawn of sorrow/order of ecclesia.\n\nAnd the soundtrack, very metroidvania-ish music, gives me chill (in a good way) !",Recommended

"Simplest review I can give you\nDid you play and love Symphony of the Night before Konami polished it in their re-release?\n>Yes\nBUY THIS GAME\nIts a right proper Castlevania game that feels more loyal to the source material than any other could be.\nSo far I'm in love with just how good the game feels to control and play. The minuet to minuet button presses are what keep me coming back to this game and, honestly, that's the biggest draw to a game these days. ""Does it feel good to push the buttons"" and in this one the answer is ""VERY YES""",Recommended
"Finally, after for the long wait ever since Castlevania, Koji Igarashi has finally returned with a great game. I would say its a great time to relive the moment. This game hands down, the best ever 'Castlevania' yet, especially in terms of the gameplay! Although the start is bit slow, when you reach the middle game and end game, basically ure in alot of treat of fun and excitement.\n\nPros:\n- Gameplay is overall excellent. Especially when u get the upgrades!\n- Sound effects is oomph~\n- Did i forget to mention that the BGM is awesome?!\n- Upgrades, upgrades, upgrades!\n- Alot alot of weapon choices and playstyle. It's all up to your choosing!\n\nCons:\n- When you reach mid game, probably you're pretty much stronk. And afterwards, the game feels easy. Your playstyle from being cautiously hitting and avoiding hits becomes some muthapaking demoness that slices everything and covering all the map in just a matter of minutes. (No joke)\n- Story wise, quite simple compared to Castlevania, which have deep lore and background story to it. \n- Game feels kinda short.\n- No playable Zangetsu yet.\n\nOverall, its a hella lot of fun and i totally have no regrets in getting the game. Worth every damn penny you spend! \nThere's alot of improvement that can be made. But to have a game this great at this current year, revived by backers and keeping the promise of releasing at Steam? What else could you ask for? 11/10!",Recommended

"Yup, That's was a game.\n\nThis is the one and only time I will and have ever backed a game on Kickstarter, and the final product slightly exceeds my expectations.\n\nI wanted another Castlevania and that's what I got. IGA really put his heart and soul into making sure this game wasn't gonna be a Mighty No. 9. The updates on progress were very frequent and the feedback on criticism was addressed and worked with on a professional level. My only negatives is with a total of 5.5 million they could have done sprite work or at least used the 3d models in a creative way to look like 2D sprite work i.e Dead Cells or Dragon Ball FighterZ. Other Kickstarted games with way smaller budgets have put out sprite work that looks very well made Timespinners, Blasphemous, and Shovel Knight and Celeste to name a few. There are also a couple really jerky camera animation that just feel out of place and really jarring getting hit by the final boss to have this weird slow-mo zoom in looks poorly animated and tacky. I would say it rightfully deserved to sit next to SoTN as one of the best games to come out of this genre with a good chunk of replayability and post release updates. (Co-op, 3 playable characters, boss rush)",Recommended

"If you like Iga's Castlevania games, this is the game for you. There's no two ways about it. This is uncompromisingly an Igavania game. \n\nThe occasional typo and the odd technical niggle are not enough to detract from the sheer enjoyment. Fantastic product that was well worth the wait.",Recommended
"I've waited so long to play another Igavania and for the most part, Bloodstained didn't disappoint.\nIt has its flaws, but it's still a great game if you miss this era of 2D Castlevania.\n\nHowever, the game is way too easy on normal, especially the bosses.\nYou can unlock Hard mode by renaming your save file ""NIGHTMARE"" and I strongly recommend doing this if you don't want to ruin the experience.\nBut like SotN, the boss fights aren't the best part of the game, the enjoyment is more about exploring, unlocking new abilities, crafting and messing up with all the shards.\nI just wish they added more different enemies, challenging bosses [spoiler]and polished the final areas because it seems a bit rushed near the end.[/spoiler]\n\nIt might not be the best metroidvania out there but I had so much fun playing it, thanks to Iga and all the backers who made this possible.",Recommended
"From what I played the game is great so far. It has banging music, excellent level design and challenging gameplay. The plot is decently interesting and the characters have full VO. It's not perfect but accomplishes what it's aiming for, to be a spiritual successor to Castlevania (is this real life!?)\n\nIn terms of cons, some of the voice acting is poorly audio balanced to the point where it feels like they are whispering. The 2.5D graphics are okay, and honestly do enhance some parts of the game, but the character/enemy sprites do feel like a downgrade from the classic Castlevania titles and cutscene animations are so very stiff.\n\nThe character and enemy designs also feel less memorable and more generic than the Castlevania titles. Skeletons are replaced with, erm... black blobs of goop in various shapes. I was a bit disappointed the main character's horns turned out to literally be just a fashion accessory, but the amount of customization you can do is pretty nice even if her outfit stays essentially the same.",Recommended
I LOVE THIS GAME!! It's been so long since I played a game that I couldn't stop playing because I was so addicted. Every time I looked at the clock I couldn't believe time flew by so fast. I was super sad I couldn't keep playing because I had work the next day. Super recommend this game you won't regret it that being said time for new game plus haha,Recommended
It may have a different name but this is a sequel to the GBA/DS Castlevania's through and through. Absolutly fantastic and that's before the future content updates that will add new modes and characters. If you was waiting for Castlevania to return don't worry it did it just changed it's name is all.,Recommended
Secret filled map and solid gameplay of SoTN combined with soul hunting aspect of AoS creates one of the best Metroidvania experiences. Highly recommended!,Recommended
"Go read a better review, I'm just giving this game a thumbs up because it deserves it.",Recommended
Not usually my kind of game but took a dive and had a blast!,Recommended
"I would have really loved to recommend this game. And if you're looking for a few hours of a good and fun game I would. But I cannot tell you how incredibly cheated out of my money I felt after completing the game on normal mode after 9 hours. I know, there is a ""Recommended"" ending and an extra boss and that is all fine and well, but if I'm going for a completist tour I'd rather do that on the highest difficulty, otherwise it just feels a bit poor. But the trouble with that is that even after completing normal mode it would not unlock hard for me, and even if it did, should I honestly play through everything again just to unlock nightmare and then again to finally start the additional 1-2 hours of content? Maybe I am missing something, and I hope I do, because the principle of the game is fun and I even enjoyed grinding some extra shards and farming materials to upgrade those shards. But what is the point of grinding anything if the game does not offer anything new to do with what you've just grinded?\nTL;DR Game is too short and does not offer enough ""end game"" for the amount of stuff you could potentially grind to polish your character.",Not Recommended
Solid GOTY material. Do you like old castlevania games? Then you will love this one. Just buy it already!,Recommended
"This game was everything I wanted it to be. Had a great time with it. Managed to get every single achievement in about 55 hours of game play. People mention SOTN, but this game is more a spiritual successor to the later Iga games like Aria of Sorrow, Dawn of Sorrow, Portrait of Ruin, and Order of Ecclesia. There's the Pokemon like mechanic of catching all enemy abilities, etc. The gameplay is, of course, derivative of the mentioned titles and doesn't really break new ground, but I don't care. It's been nearly 11 years since Order of Ecclesia which was the last Iga title. I'm just happy to be playing Metroidvania again after such a long dry spell. Really looking forward to Zangetsu mode and other DLC that's been promised. Not sure how long it'll take, but I'm already happy with my purchase.\n\nOnly thing that really dampered my experience is that I experienced a lot of crashing until I finally disabled the frame smoothing setting in the options. Not sure why that setting is enabled by default considering it was the cause of my instability.",Recommended
One of the best games ever! Igavania rocks! Hope to see more games like this on all consoles and PC Steam!,Recommended
Best Castlevania game since SOTN!,Recommended
"This game goes right on the list of the best Metroidvanias next to Super Metroid, Symphony of the Night, and Hollow Knight.",Recommended
im about 4 hours into the game and im loving it. the game uses cheat codes for something and i was able to play hard mode right at the start. man I regret that now because the game is killing me but its that more enjoyable to me. my only complaint is there is a wide about of game crashing bugs which need to be fixed. but hey got to love any game with a jojo's reference.,Recommended
"The game brings back my memories of Castlevania on playstation, the graphics and sounds are great, but the problem is that it has some bugs. Minor ones are fine but the crashes are annoying, especially after you collect shards (that don't drop all the time) then randomly crashes. It crashed while I was reading a book, crashed randomly while I was exploring as well.\n\nI play windowed but my computer and specs should be fine for most games on the market (I use a 1080 GPU) and I played games like X4: Foundations without major issues/crashes.\n\nI am wondering if this is something other players are experienced and whether there is any solution yet?\n\nOther than this, I am loving the game. Very relaxing (except the 8-bit nightmare part that makes me feel like playing Super Mario).",Recommended

"There's a little bit of jank, but it definitely feels like a Castlevania game. A bit of Symphony of the Night, a dash of Aria/Dawn of Sorrow, a pinch of Order of Ecclesia, all perfect seasonings for a worthy successor. Looking forward to the updates to come!",Recommended
"Great game that really does live up to Symphony of the Night, very similar in many ways. There is tons of weapons and skills to find giving you tons of content if you want to find everything. There is also tons of easter eggs and secrets to find, probably more than SotN had. You could probably beat the game pretty quickly if you know where to go but the beauty of these games is figuring stuff out for yourself. \n\nMy complaints about it are pretty minor. I have crashed a few times and noticed a few bugs- most annoying being stuck in the water not being able to jump out. Worst case scenario I just use a waystone. Some bosses also seem to be better designed than others. I really liked the ""Blood"" boss (don't want to spoil anything) as it had a lot of fun mechanics and wasn't extremely easy. Other bosses, mainly the earlier ones and the train boss, are not easy to see where it is safe. I can see the attack coming but don't know what to do about it. For these bosses I found it better to just not bother dodging and just shotgun them in the face, surprisingly they died very quickly with this method even in hard mode- perhaps they need some tweaks. I also glitched out at the tower boss (don't want to spoil again) and fell through the ground, somehow this instantly killed the boss.\n\nThat all said, I'd still recommend this game highly, especially if you're a fan of metroidvanias. It's worth the occasional crash and bugs, hopefully they can fix these things with time. It really is gearing up to be one of my favorite games in the past decade.",Recommended
"Like classic Castlevania? Buy this, it's Castlevania.",Recommended
I don't write reviews but I just wanted to throw this out there as this game has already found a special place in my heart.\n\nSotN is a game that really hit home for me when I was younger. I play it through every couple of years just for the nostalgia of the feeling of going through the castle for the first time. I've been following this closely since the kickstarter campaign and I must say I'm impressed with the amount of change and community involvement that has made this game into what it is today.\n\nBloodstained: RotN does a lot right for a new trip down a very familiar nostalgia filled lane.\n\nI'm usually not a fan of 2.5D games. I've got a deep love for 2D whether it's hand drawn like hollow knight or sprite work. Bloodstained's art is what I'd considering a direct translation from sprite work to 3D. It's not mind bendingly beautiful but it has the same kind of hand made feeling that made SotN so distinct and memorable. \n\nIt's game play and art style are the same in the way that you feel like you've been there before but they're new. It's not the same old well beaten metroidvania that can be found in SotN and its successors. \n\nYou know it. You know how it plays. But it looks and feels just different enough to be its own entity. \n\nI've only experienced one crash which as others have mentioned that happens when reading a bookcase.\n\nI think I view this as a better game because it reminds me of my child hood. It doesn't feel like a game from this decade. It feels old yet fluid. If you grew up with SotN or any other metroidvania's this will be right up your alley. \n\nIf you're expecting a modern flashy 2.5d adventure through a crazy castle with dazzling particle effects and fast paced combo based game play... you might be best looking elsewhere.\n\nBut if you give this a chance I think you'll find the experience well worth the asking price.,Recommended
"Your character's appearance changes with every single equipment change.\n\nOh, Iga, you really do understand us...",Recommended
"It's what you'd want from a metroidvania game. 3d graphics in a 2.5d world with great combo mechanics and a top tier soundtrack complete with fantastic storytelling and difficult puzzle mechanics You can customize miriam however you want once you find the sane barber, so enjoy your demon killing heroine to the fullest with whatever playstyle and customizations you want.",Recommended
"Superlative level design. Feels great to play. Amazing soundtrack. Loads of game-depth. Story starts a little slow but is, at minimum, enjoyable. Even accounting for a few uncanny moments, the game looks phenomenal. Satisfying to unravel. Great protagonist.\n\nJust a very solid, fun game.",Recommended
"Castlevania: Symphony of the Night is an amazing sequel to Castlevania: Rondo of Blood. Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night is basically just Symphony of the Night except in 3d and with Miriam and co. An amazing game as far as I have gotten, the bosses are all fun and interesting especially the second boss (He hot). Bloodstained is a kickstarter project done right and I'm sad that I didn't fund this excellent product. \n\nMy only issue is my own, as far as I'm aware. My laptop is apparently worse than a potato as it cannot run Bloodstained well at all. The audio is all screwed, there is screen tearing, and a few other things like that. \n\nBloodstained is excellent, one of my favourite games this year. This is definitely high on the list of amazing games released this year. \n\nIga is back!\n\nEdit: After updating my laptop, the game started to run fine.",Recommended
"[i]A copy of this game was provided by the developer/publisher for review purposes.[/i]\n\n[h1]Bloodstained[/h1]\n\nThe time is finally here. The moment all of us Castlevania diehards at first dreamed of, and then with patiently waited for with bated breath is finally here. The fruition of a legendary partnership come to an end, but spawning new life in the form of an ambitious indie studio with age-old and proven talent. A new generation of creators breathes life into one of the most iconic and revered genres to this day in gaming, the Metroidvania\n\nNow obviously due to legal woes and fallen alliances of great gaming minds of the past, Igarashi and Co. aren't really allowed to really use the Castlevania trademark here, but we all know better and we know what this is in spirit.\n\nBloodstained was first unveiled to a gaming world starved for a new Castlevania title, nearly 4 years ago, in the form of an obviously viral and instantly famous kickstarter. After such a long wait I can safely say it has been more than worth it.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\n\nRight away the player is introduced to a table of Attributes they'll be wielding to study over. Aside from the usual elementals, there's Light and Dark attributes as well as Poison, Stone, and Curse. These work their way into your eventual weapon sets and the customization you'll need to diversify when heading into various areas. Different monsters will have different attribute weaknesses. Already this proves that Bloodstained, as expected, is more on par with Igarashi's later and more complex Nintendo DS Metroidvanias with huge selections of weapon and defense types and tables of elemental weaknesses and strengths to consider.\n\nFans of the exploration side of Metroidvanias have a lot to look forward to with the same sprawling map of secret routes and hidden short-cuts that make up the vast network of stages. A demonic castle holds a plethora of nostalgic imagery as well as elegant and goth-y new set pieces to learn your way around the intricate map layouts of.\n\nAnother thing this will fall right into line with for Symphony of the Night fans is how the game controls. Simple directional controls of the platforming genre interspersed with a slick and simple combat formula that has withstood the tests of time. The familiar backdash mechanic of Symphony of the Night is here as well with more brevity and swiftness than before, making for split second dodges from more powerful telegraphed attacks. Different tiers of Kung-Fu Boots also supply additional fighting game styled button combinations to experiment with, giving the player a variety of new movement-based attacks.\n\nThere's a Heck of a lot more dialogue and cutscenes here in Bloodstained than in any previous Iga Metroidvania, and it all certainly contains a lot less of that old traditional masculinity. The traditional masculinity is absent, and I absolutely miss it. Gone are the He-Man antics of strong, classic, European men stroming through a series of memorable horror-tropes, and instead we have something that resembles something more of a modern-day high-brow fantasy anime. That's not a bad thing, as those who appreciate a deeper and more complex story will find a lot to follow here. \n\n[h1]Soundtrack[/h1]\n\nEverything an Igarashi-era Castlevania fan could possibly hope for is present here in the elegant soundtrack. The enitrety of the compositions seems to be heavily leaning towards orchestral and symphonic sounds this time around, with not as much of the old eerie electronic sound. \n\nDespite this natural trend towards a more organic and symphonic sound, Bloodstained still absolutely carries many nods and references to compositions of past Castlevania titles, and any person who's played Symphony of the Night or any of the other more recent Iga titles will instantly feel a certain nostalgia even for the more original tracks. Everything here absolutely carries that certain dark mood we all fondly remember from its predecessors.\n\n[h1]Final Thought[/h1]\n\nIn an age where the onslaught of remakes and revivals generally fall short of its original vision and creativity, Bloodstained does not dissapoint in the least. Building on what Symphony of the Night and Aria of Sorrow fans know, love, and crave and then some.\n\nBloodstained is the Igavania we all know and love, with just enough of a change in pace and scenery to make it its own thing. An absolute masterpiece for generations new and old, alike.",Recommended
"As a fan since the release of Castlevania SOTN, Bloodstained is a dream come Recommended. Ive waited for over 20 years! Bloodstained hasnt disappointed me in a slightest bit. I cant stop playing! Every room is like a beautiful stage. So much detail. The eye candy is a overdose! Using Nvidia DSR of 5120x3200. It looks amazing! Voice actors/actresses A+! This is the best side scroller Ive played since SOTN. Im feeling like a crazed fan. Thank you Artplay, 505 Games, and most importantly thank you Koji Igarashi. You .. are...

"It's hard to express how much joy it gives me that this project ultimately managed to deliver on its promises after so much troubled development and drama along the way.  It's the Castlevania that we wanted but were denied, now presented to us just as we hoped it would be -- thoroughly Castlevania in all but name.\n\nPC port is also excellent.  Zero crashes in 48 hours of play, and running at a smooth 144fps almost perpetually, with only very occasional loading-related stutter outside of one boss attack.\n\nIf you like Castlevania, you're going to love it.\n",Recommended

"Finally the successor to symphony of the night arrives.  Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night elevates the 2-d platforming metroidvania genre by adding a number of new features.  There are shards that allow customization of how your character plays, unique benefits on some gear can change yoru playstyle, techniques give advantages to weapons that would otherwise be stat comparisons, and cosmetically you can change your character.\n\nIt's fun to play, everything is done with a high degree of polish.  Leveling, farming loot, crafting, questing, it all fits together and feels fun and rewarding, and you can always ignore all of that and just push through the game.\n\nI think about the game when I'm not playing.  I want to play again on other difficulties and try different weapon sets, which I almost never want to do in other games after I finish them.  And there's more content coming from the creator.\n\nSo far this is my favorite game for 2019, excellent purchase.",Recommended
"It's great to see how the developer transformed critisism into praise through hard work. I'm glad they actually took their time on this one, it's a really enjoyable experience so far, much better than I anticipated.",Recommended
"If you aren't in the mood for a long review that's going to pick the game apart to it's core, the TL:DR is this:\n\nYes, you should buy the game. But maybe not right now. There are a lot of technical issues that need to be fixed before I can say it's ""the best -vaina ever.""\n\nOkay, full review below:\n\nFirst off I want to talk about the technical issues I have faced over the past 15 hours of playing.\n\n•14 crashes, almost one per hour.\n\n•4 bugs that I encountered that forced me to restart the game and lose progress.\n\n•2 Bugs that annoyed me but didn't hamper my experience that much, but are very visible even with surface level play and makes me wonder what they were doing this entire time the game got pushed back, and...\n\n•Some mechanics that I just have to scratch my head at.\n\nWhen the game works, it works really well and makes you want to keep playing. Especially for castlevaina nutters like myself, who can't get enough of the metroidvaina genre. The problem is that it sometimes stops working after an hour and a half of playtime, meaning I've been forced to painstakingly run back to a save point EVERY SINGLE TIME I do something or find something I want to keep and don't want to risk losing it in a crash. That's time consuming as hell, and honestly if I didn't have to panic save every time I got some 1% drop item or rare soul from a monster, i'd probably have a few less hours in my run-time and a few less gray hairs. It's not a good feeling to be in constant fear of losing progress, not because of your own lack of ability, but because the game just isn't well made in the coding department.\n\nThe other times that the game ""half"" works, like when item bags bug out CONSTANTLY when they drop on slanted surfaces, or when you jump in the water and Miriam gets stuck in a falling animation forever, forcing you to restart the game, it just piles on to the frustration I had from the constant crashes. If it's not the game crapping the bed and forcing you to Alt+F4, it's bugging out with items that ""drop"" but never stop falling, or they get stuck inside the wall, or the stairs, or just fall through the world.\n\nI hate to be that guy, but what were all the delays for if the game is going to release in this state? The game was funded in May of 2015, and release dates were pushed back a few times after that. Don't get me wrong. I don't mind waiting for a game if it means it's going to be polished and ready, but if we're going to get an early access game, why charge retail prices and make a fanfare like the game is ready? Because it's not really polished yet, there's a lot of REALLY rough edges, edges I feel like are impossible to have missed if they had spent any of those millions of dollars on a QA or testing team, instead of hiring David Hayter to play Snakegetsu.\n\nI know it sounds like I'm downtalking the game. And to an extent, I am. The game was funded years ago, amassed millions extra, didn't launch with any of the extra content shown on the kickstarter page, changed the arrangement for the people who backed the kickstarter originally by giving everyone the ability to buy the ""exclusive"" iga boss fight for $10 (It's one boss fight extra for $10. That was supposed to be exclusive ""Kickstarter only"" content, but honestly it's more infuriating that instead of wasting time making crap like that, they didn't polish the game and then release the stuff like THAT later.)\n\nMy question is this: Where did that 5.5 million dollars go? Because if I had to guess, out of that 5.5 million, maybe 300 thousand of it was spent on the game and its mechanics. The rest went to booze, glasses for Iga to break, a boss fight for iga to stroke his ego to, and hiring voice actors that the game really didn't need. No disrespect to david hayter, but he has one voice. ""Snake"". Giving that to Zangetsu just makes it sound like a bad fan-dubbing. God only knows how much Iga threw at him to work on the game, but it's just indicative of the same kind of issue that Mighty Number 9 run into. \n\nSo much money, so little of it showing in the work itself. The graphical overhaul was nice, but that should have been done first thing, not something to be blown up as a big reveal. Simple things like a WORKING GAME were bypassed for superfluous things like putting shovel knight, Celeste and other random stuff into the game that should have been secondary. Stuff that should have been done after the game was in a working state.\n\nIgarashi himself is a good example of how the development was handled. Lavish, reckless, and with a nonchalant presence of inflated ego, no matter how earned.\n\nNOW, ALL THAT out of the way, let me break down the game into it's constituent parts (and not taking into account the bugs.)\n\n•Combat: 8/10\n\nThe combat is easily the best part of the game, feeling fluid and snappy while retaining the SoTN feel.\n\n•Sound: 7/10\n\nWorkable, but nothing really too fancy either. Nothing seems to sound very out of place but it's not exactly superb either. It works\n\n•Music: ?/10\n\nOkay, here's where I have some REALLY mixed feelings. Some parts of the game are void of music. Some have amazing music, some ENEMIES (Tamako) have their own tunes and you'll almost feel bad about killing her because the tune kicks so much ass....but also at the same time I also can't remember any of the tunes now that the game is off. If you started playing a tune and asked ""What part of the castle is this from?"" I wouldn't be able to tell you. There's no ""E1M1"" or ""Vampire Killer"" or ""Wily's castle 2"" kind of tunes that you immediately go ""OH THAT'S FROM THAT AREA"". It's just all very ""Castlevaina-like"" and ""works"".\n\n•Crafting system: 1/10\n\nCompletely pointless, your crafted weapons and armor will become outdated in a matter of about 2-3 bosses after the start of the game. It's a mechanic that exists and it's not like it's broken or anything. It's just not really worth it to grind out. \n\n•Castle size/Layout/Theme: 6/10\n\nSo on the kickstarter the page says it's ""Iga's biggest castle"". I'm not sure if this is completely Recommended, seeing as how SOTN had two castles of about the same size in it (Yes it's the same castle flipped and you can flip the castle here, the difference is that in this game, inverting the castle is instant and has MUCH less impact on the gameplay. It's mainly used just to clean up a few loose map points and grab some ""hidden"" chests and items. Inverting the castle in this game is as to flying as a bat was in SOTN, but more annoying and finicky.) but overall I'm fairly pleased with the castle. I feel like it's a little...samey, across some of the areas? With HUGE random jumps in style in other areas. You'll go from fire caverns to underwater to deserts to alchemy labs to...Japan. Just, Japan. Stereotypical japan at that, with ninjas and demon oni monkeys. It just feels odd. The game also ends in a place that feels like a midgame stage, rather than the final arena. (Though to be fair, Iga stole what looks most like an endgame area for himself.)\n\n•Soul variety: 3/10\n\nAre there lots of soul shards (Monster abilities) to use? Yes. Will you use them all? Hell no. not if you've got a b rain on you. Maybe if you want to gimp yourself? Gold drop rate+, Attack speed/damage+, Ability to see breakable walls, Void ray and the story centric monster abilities are pretty much going to be the best bets. There's no real reason to use anything else. You can upgrade them all you want, but for the most part they are either niche as hell in use-case, or just have better options.\n\n•Weapon variety: 6/10\n\nThe weapons suffer less than the soul shards. There are a fair number of weapons and while few of them will last longer than the first two bosses, you can usually find the same ""style"" of weapon that you like throughout the game (Hint hint, Katanas are going to be something you need to get really good at using if you want to get the good ending. Embrace your inner weeaboo) and the 8-bit weapons you can create through crafting are novel.",Recommended
"Great game, worthy successor to SOTN and the handheld Castlevanias. Weapons and enemy souls are  fun to use and relatively well balanced. Every person I've seen play the game has a different approach and that's always a great sign. Bosses actually feel threatening which is very different then SOTN and most other metroidvanias and is a big positive in my book. The crafting and cooking systems are well fleshed out and intelligently integrated into the core gameplay loop while never feeling tedious to engage with. It's one of those games that is just a joy to move around in, if you aren't convinced on gameplay footage I encourage you to try it yourself.\n\nJust be prepared to look up a guide here and there. Gets very cryptic towards the end. Story is very in line with past Castlevanias, so incredibly corny (in reference to old horror movies it takes inspiration from I'm sure). There's some jank here and there but none of it significantly detracts from the experience (save the crashes which aren't terribly frequent but are a big deal due to the saving system) and the devs are very involved with patching and providing free content releases so even that will leave in time.\n\nEasy to recommend.

"i can only imagine that before creating Bloodstained and upon seeing all the new indie metroidvanias being developed Koji Igarashi said ""alright kids, playtime is over, now let a real master work"", because Bloodstained could easily be one of the greatest metrodivanias ive ever played and its painfully clear why Iga is one of the grandfathers of the genre\n\nthe amount of content and brilliant design decisions in this game is baffling, picture this, what is one of the sometimes boring part of metroidvanias? backtracking, with Symphony of the Night Iga added RPG elements to the formula so that even while backtracking you made some progress character-wise, then in Aria of Sorrow and Dawn of Sorrow the soul system was added, each enemy you kill has a set chance of granting you their special abilities, so backtracking was even less of an issue because now you could level up AND maybe get the special abilities of the enemies you killed\n\nnow Bloodstained on top of doing all of this as well (the souls are now called shards), it adds a crafting system, quests and reappearing chests, so doesnt matter where you are exploring in this giantic map you are making progress in some way shape or form, either getting new materials for crafting, leveling up, getting shards, completing quests, getting to previously unreachable routes or chests, etc\n\nthe amount of content in this game is just plain ridiculous, tons of weapons, the weapons have special abilities, tons of equipment, tons of shards, a new type of shard/soul power that allows you to aim your attack in a 360 degree angle, tons of secrets, a giantic map, and unlike symphony of the night, the game is very well balanced, you will be challenged, specially against the bosses, and even if you arent, there are 2 extra difficulty levels fam, knock yourself out\n\nalso the soundtrack is easily on par with any castlevania game, a series already known for its outstanding music\n\nthe only criticism i have is that the game can be slightly glitchy and it lacks a bit of polish specially during cutscenes or in certain animations, but its nothing of importance really\n\nin a nutshell, this is the new standard lads, this is what peak metroidvania looks like, if you like this genre like i do you owe yourself to get this\n\nEDIT: having finished the game i have to say it IS the best metroidvania ive played, very long too, it took me 27 hours to beat, and i know i still missed some stuff and its going to have free DLC!\n\nthe only bad thing is the lack of better polish which is sure to improve with patches, just get this, its the best metroidvania ive ever played",Recommended

"I've played about 7+ hours (3.5 on record + 4 offline) and revealed about 25% of the map. But I think it's safe to say that this is one of the best metroidvania games out there. (Of course. It's from the minds that shaped this sub-genre. Duh.)\n\nPerformance & bugs:\nPlayed on 2 machines. Desktop with i7-6700, RAM 32GB, GTX1060, Win10 64 bit. And laptop with i5 something (newer gen than my i7), RAM 16GB, GTX1050Ti, Win10 64 bit. Both at 1080p on max settings.\n\n- Minor frame rate dips below 60 and minor freezes occurred here and there on both machines when the room was busy with enemies and effects. Nothing serious though. [strike]No crash so far.[/strike] \n*** UPDATE ***\nAt 30+ hours and beat the game once with 99.7% of the map revealed, there was one crash out of nowhere. Be sure to save every time you pass a save room since the game has no checkpoint.\n\n- Minor bugs. Voices were lost in some parts of the dialogues. Items dropped on slope/slanting surfaces (ground, stairs, ceiling) got stuck there and couldn't be picked up. Nothing game-breaking. \n\nSo, it's not buttery smooth all the time, but not bad either. It might be improved with later patch(es).\n\nMy experience with this game:\n\nFirst, I was skeptical. \nI was interested in the game but I learned my lesson from buying Star Wars Battlefront 2 and Destiny 2 early. So, no hype train for me. The gameplay shown in the trailers looked slow and not very exciting. I knew that ""It's Iga!"". But hey, too many studios f-ked up their own big franchises lately, so I waited.\n\nThen I saw the trailer where the dev took criticisms into account and overhauled the graphics. That's a lot of work. It's not something you do unless you really love your game. And then I saw the name Wayforward. They have many good 2.5D games in their portfolio. Hmmm... interesting. Okay, I'll try for 1.9 hour so I could decide whether to return it.\n\nThe game started off slow. Then it pulled me in more and more to the point that I didn't want to stop playing. It's Symphony of the Night reincarnated! The combat, enemies, exploration, art direction, music, and everything you love about SOTN and metroidvania games in general are all there and executed really well. The game also has comedic relief here and there and some dialogues are so campy it's good.\n\nThe game is worth its asking price already, yet the team has promised more free contents.\n\nConclusion: \nThis is a must-buy for metroidvania lovers, and a very good entry point for newcomers to this sub-genre. I encourage those who are still on the fence to push on longer than 2 hours, that's when the game takes off. \n\n[To the dev]\nThank you ArtPlay, 505, and everyone involved in this project. \n\nThank you for showing greedy publishers that a single-player game can very well survive and thrive by giving players their money's worth, and not by gouging out contents, selling them separately and bullsh-ting about it.\n\nYou guys are great :)",Recommended
"Castlevania: Symphony of the Night is one of my top 3 favorite games of all time and it feels like it just got a Recommended sequel. I was a kickstarter backer, and after 4 years of hype, it was not disappointing. The amount of  items, enemies, special attacks, secrets and easter eggs in this game is massive. Exploring the castle is addictive and it's hard to put down, and the online community of fans is awesome. If you are on the fence about buying this, stop and buy it right now and KILL THOSE MURDERERS DEAD!!!!",Recommended
"This game surpassed all my expectations. Iga and his team really delivered a Recommended spiritual sucessor to the 2D Castlevania games, combining all the elements that makes ""Metroidvania"" great. Great combat, high emphasis on exploration, and tons of customization to fit different playstyles.\n\nMuch like Symphony of the Night, you can really feel the empowerement of Miriam as you progress through the game. Though luck plays a very important role, as enemies have low drop rates of their items and shards (this game's magic system), the difficult is not very high; and if a boss feels too powerful, a simple grind can solve it. On the other hand, it is VERY easy to break this game and become very overpowered, which itself is not a problem, in my opinion; it is part of the flavor. \n\nThe endgame feels fantastic, with you wiping entire screens of enemies in seconds and being able to move very fast through the map. Feels really good and makes the grinding for materials way less tiring.\n\nUnlike other people claiming in their reviews, I've only experienced a single crash through all my playthrough, right after entering the castle. I tried opening a bookcase and it displayed an error message, which closed the game; only lost around 15 minutes of progress, so no big deal. My advice is: SAVE OFTEN.\n\nThe only issue I truly have with this game is that bug where dropped items clip through the collisions of the background and you cannot obtain them; although they can be acquired if you pass through them and wait until they disappear, which will automatically give you the item (it takes around 10 seconds for them to despawn).\n\nI also wish the custom markers to set on the map could be color coded (like in Castlevania: Curse of Darkness), which would greatly help the player to filter points of interest based on color. I also wish that New Game+ pumped the difficulty, because the game itself is considerable easy, in my opinion.\n\nOverall, I grealy recommend this game, wether you're a veteran from Metroidvanias or a new player. It is truly a love letter from Iga to all the fans of the Castlevania titles he worked on. You can see there was a lot of passion behind this project. I hope this is one of many games Studio 505 will deliver us.",Recommended
"Easily one of the best Metroidvania games I've played in years. The game is a Recommended spiritual successor to the Castlevania series in every way. It looks great, plays better and has great combat with a great deal of customizability and variety. The RPG elements and upgrades are vast and give you lots of room to build your character however you like. It's a little janky in places. Collision detection and audio bugs here and there. But past that this game is absolutely great. This is truly everything we were promised with the initial kickstarter. Konami has decided Castlevania games are dead but we no longer need them. Koji Igarashi and 505 games have knocked it out of the park with this one. Play it.",Recommended
"I was one of the backers for this game, and even having waited so long I'm pleased with what I got.\nDefinitely on the right track for metroidvania games, and if IGA and all his team want to make another of these I'd totally get that too.\n\nThere are a few issues still, and they patched out some easy farming, but it doesn't take away from how cool the game is on the whole.\n\nThe backer content (now DLC) is enjoyable too.",Recommended
Basically its Aria of Sorrow meets Symphony of the Night. Good game not much different than the typical Metroidvania. Only down side is the frequent crashing and slowdown. The graphics are a bit much and don't really lend themselves to optimization.,Recommended
"A messy, ugly and all around unappealing game. Even after going as far as to rework the graphics, their design-choices for various parts of the game is straight up bad - I understand this was a kickstarter-backed game, but that doesn't mean I want to see real pictures of their faces in the entrance to the castle, talk about a poorly realized world.",Not Recommended

I got to play the game on PS4 first since it arrived by mail before I could even download the game on Steam. I've beaten the game and I'm ready for the second game. \n\nI have no complaints about the game except I wish it was a bit longer. I have 24 Hours on my save at 99.9% map completion. I'm by no means a completionist but I did put in some effort to try to discover all the hidden items and rooms. I'll probably put the game down for a bit and play it on hard mode with NG+ and then nightmare mode. \n\nThis game is fun and it has all the fun mechanics of the Castlevania games plus some.,Recommended
"A bloody good time stained only by some minor issues.\n\nDRACULA\n- Substantial Metroidvania gameplay. A huge map to explore full of secrets that gradually unlock over time as your character develops new skills and powers.\n- Platforming and combat mechanics feel snappy and responsive. \n- Different weapons, techniques and shards allow you to custom create your combat experience.\n- Soundtrack is powerful and sets the tone beautifully for a dark action platformer.\n- Lots of progression available via the crafting system.\n- David m***** f****** Hayter!\n\nLACKULA\n- Several bugs and glitches that will cause you headaches. Some I encountered included items dropping that can't be picked up, audio glitches that cause sound effects to hang between scenes and one crash to desktop (complete with progress wipe).\n- Some techniques feel more thought out than others, with some worse than the basic attack button.\n- Farming specific monsters for specific drops or shards gets tedious at times.\n- Minor quality of life improvements missing (Can't zoom or free scroll map while at a fast travel beacon, have to exit/enter a save room if you want to save again, etc). My guess is these got passed up to put in more silly chairs.\n\nWOULD RECOMMEND TO:\nFans of Metroidvania style games, or anyone who is into action games themed around discovery. Anyone who has given serious thought to inducing themselves into a coma in the hopes of forgetting about and re-experiencing Castlevania Symphony of the Night.\n\nWell worth the retail price for the story playthrough alone, and the developers are promising additional free post-launch content that might further add value to this game.

Everything from the music, weapon, monsters, castle, and characters have been a joy to experience from beginning to end....honestly I don't have much more that I want to say about the game outside of singing praises about it.

"The platforming in this game is atrocious. Terrible.  Potentially some of the worst garbage in any metroid-vania style game.  Platforms are often not clear where you can stand and where you drop. Animations for jumping make precision unnecessarily difficult. Activation of fighting-style game special moves is likewise inconsistent and picky.  \n\nCombine all of that with the penalty for failing a platforming jump often means you have to run back through a frustratingly circuitous route to try again....it robs the game of anything resembling fun or enjoyment. \n\nThere are better games in the genre to spend your money on. I get that Igurashi was trying to make a spiritual successor or tribute to Symphony of the Night, but this game is notably bad, and not worth the asking price. This is a $10 game at best. Wait for a sale if you absolutely have to buy it. Otherwise pass.",Not Recommended

"I don't write reviews very often. I'm a hater turned a convert on this game. I wasn't convinced on the art direction and 2.5D graphical style. Pre-release footage made this seem pretty low budget. I was wrong. Really wrong.\n\nSure, I'm still not enamored with the art direction, but I can confidently say this is one of the best Metroidvanias ever made. The number of distinct weapons, shards, and fighting styles available is stunning. The huge interconnected map is straight out of the classics. The music is some of the best from the genre. I can't help but hum along to it. The story is a bit cheesy, in classic Castlevania style, but I think it benefits from being something completely new. I found myself engrossed in it a lot more than I expected. The voice acting is even quite good, which is the last thing I expected from a Kickstarter-funded game. I also found myself surprisingly enjoying the visual customization you have over Miriam.\n\nAlso, there's a mod out there that makes this run in 21:9. I never thought I'd being playing a SotN successor at 100+ FPS at 3440x1440 21:9, but here we are.\n\nI can't recommend this enough if you have any interest in the genre at all. I'll probably pick up a copy on the Switch when it's out too, because I'll certainly be playing this one multiple times over time.",Recommended

That said, this game doesn't revolutionize or change up the genre, that's perfectly fine with me and I don't think the game is worse because of it -- but if you don't like Metroidvania games, then this game is unlikely to change your opinion of them.",Recommended
"This is a worthy follow up to Symphony of the Night. I enjoyed all the DS Castlevania games, and jumping into Bloodstained feels just like I'm playing a modern AAA Castlevania game. Movement is great after you get the double jump, the map is one of my favorite Metroidvania maps yet, and its decently challenging while still being very fair and forgiving. My only problems have been picky inputs on ""Street Fighter"" like special moves and some softlock glitches. Really only minor nitpicks than anything that ruins the experience. And the game as plenty of replay value, with even more coming with all the promised kickstarter added features, much like Shovel Knight. And I do put Bloodstained up there with Shovel Knight, and hope to see more games of this quality in the future.",Recommended

"Overall, this was an awesome experience and a great game, definitely a must-buy for any Igavania fan out there. However, there are some issues that need to be brought up. So, here goes.\n\n[h1] Cons: [/h1]\n\nThere are weird clips in the game due to the 3D models. For example, Miriam goes into walls if you do an attack standing flush against it. Better than your attack hitting the wall or anything, but still awkward looking.\n\nA ton of grammatical errors and other problems with the captions. Sometimes the captions don't match the voice lines at all, or have missing words. Not so bad it looks like an indie game or anything, but still definitely noticeable.\n\nWeird glitches in general. Some textures that look bad bumping against each other/don't mesh properly. Once, when using the portal to one of the end game areas, instead of Miriam spiraling into the portal, she just shot off like a string of spaghetti to the left of the screen. Sometimes blue chests get marked on the map, sometimes they don't. Plenty of other minor stuff that I can't remember off the top of my head. Nothing game breaking, but with how long this game took, it's a surprising lack of polish.\n\nA ton of handholding. Every time you visit the shop just to sell off some stuff, buy more potions, etc., the NPC gives you a hint of where to go next, even if you already knew and were heading that way but just needed to offload, stop and craft, wanted supplies, or whatever.\n\nThe game is really straightforward until one specific moment. There's no clue - at least that I saw - about the Aegis armor. It was in an area that I had already visited  and was marked on the map as being visited. There was not even a trace about having to go to this specific spot to get the armor, and you need it to progress. Considering how much handholding the game does with hints, this was annoying.\n\n3D models aren't that great, the characters lose a ton of definition and shadows look terrible on their faces. The castle back- and foregrounds are awful, they look like indie Unity engine game assets. A lot of the art is great, but it didn't translate well to the 3D models.\n\nSome very boring and repetitive particle effects, specifically on certain enemies' death animations. \n\nHowever, the game wasn't ruined by all of this.\n\n[h2] Pros: [/h2]\n\nA ton of great music! Also a surprising amount of returning tracks from past games! I didn't think we'd hear so many classic themes, figured they'd be locked up by copyrights.\n\nIt builds even more on every system in older Igavanias, especially the Sorrow games. Honestly, it feels like this should've been a sequel to Dawn of Sorrow.\n\nPlenty of grinding for people who like that stuff, and none of it is entirely necessary to progress through the game.\n\nThe story is good enough, which is all I ask for. Basically just a rehash of Aria of Sorrow, but that's alright. You don't play an Igavania for the story, after all.\n\nFull voice acting is an exciting addition to this series. Definitely enhances the anime style.\n\nA host of references to literally everything. Shovel Knight's an enemy, references to Castlevania galore, and so on.\n\nAwkward fighting game style inputs from Symphony of the Night are back, but luckily they aren't necessary for progression and most of them didn't seem to be much stronger than regular attacks, so it's just a bit of a bonus for people who are used to doing those sorts of inputs. (Personally, in the hectic fighting of these games, I don't like to stop to do quarter-circle attack inputs, for example, but that's just me.)\n\nA few hidden bosses, and plenty of secrets to discover.\n\nThe fakeout-style ending of past Igavanias returns.\n\nNo cryptic clues that you need to decipher to reach the Recommended ending. Once you find the stupid Aegis armor it's straightforward from there.\n\nAll in all, I'm glad I backed this game like 5 years ago or whatever. The final product is exactly what I had hoped it would be in most ways. However, there is a disturbing lack of polish considering how long the game took and how late it is compared to when they originally said it would release. It doesn't do much to compete with more modern metroidvanias, so you might be spoiled by your Hollow Knights and such, but definitely a fun experience and I'm excited to go do all the bonus stuff now that I've beaten the main game.",Recommended

"This is SOTN 2, straight up.  The amount of secrets and weapons to be found is ridiculous in a good way, and the crafting system is actually very well implemented, enough that you will want to collect components to build new weapons, armors, and even food!  Bloodstained captures the feel of old castlevania games in a way that many modern metroidvanias have failed to do.  Story and setting have the gothic horror feel down pat.

There's a very obvious twist that could be seen from a mile away.\n\nAnd although it's Recommended that my love for this game might deviate from my old, childhood love for Symphony of the Night, this game still stands very strong on it's own feet. The characters are nice, the gear choice is pretty big (though there are some OP choices, of course), and the Shard system is very well done, the spells being very useful.\n\nAll in all, 10/10.

"Koji Igarashi's new Metroidvania title after leaving Konami and joining 505 games.\n\nMiriam's playstyle takes a lot from his previous metroidvania titles:\nShards in the style of souls or glyphs from Soma and Shanoa (Sorrow Titles, Order of Ecclesia)\nWeapon arts in the style of the whippers and Alucard (Harmony of Despair, Portrait of Ruin, Sotn)\nMovement tech via backdash cancel and the dive kick. \n\nIt's a title that I can definitely recommend for people that have played previous Metroidvania titles as it definitely feels like a castlevania game without having the proper castlevania references.",Recommended
This game is amazing!!! I forgot how much I enjoyed playing this style of game. The voice acting style sounds good. Controls are pretty solid. Brings back good nostalgia.,Recommended

"Bloodstained Ritual of the Night is absolutely f!@#$%^ awesome! It's truly the spiritual successor of Symphony of the Night with a modern 2.5D visual art style, original story, crafting abilities, free future DLC and a whole lot of other amazing sh!t. If you like Symphony of the Night, Castlevania or gothic Metroidvania style game from the man who started it all, BUY THIS GAME! I backed this game in 2015 when it was first announced at Kickstarter and the end result was worth every single penny.\n\nA little background on me, I've been following this game for a long time and I even met Iga and the artist Mana at NYCC 2017 at their booth. I was able to briefly speak with them, take a picture, get a bloodstained art piece from Mana with signed autograph from both Iga and Mana, and played the demo. I had no doubt in my mind that this game would be successful. Iga and the team behind this game should be commended for the tremendous effort and promise to delivering an amazing game. In addition, these guys also released a retro style Castlevania game called Bloodstained Curse of the Moon which was a free game for backers of Bloodstained Ritual of the Night. How many developers you know would do this? Do yourself a favor and get this game and support it so we can get a bigger better sequel.",Recommended

"The game by itself is really good. If you love the castlevania series, then this is for you. Cool music, cool bosses, cool NPC's and of course, a huge castle to explore. The only issue here is that there are few crashes, when you read a book for example. I really hope they'll fix those really soon.\nExcept that, you have a mix between SOTN, order of ecclesia and aria of sorrow, and the result is fantastic ! 100% recommend if you like those king of games.",Recommended
"As a fan of the Castlevania series dating back to the NES, words cannot express how much I love this game! I only started playing the Metroidvania games about six years ago, and in that time they've become my favorite Castlevania games to date! \n\nPlaying Bloodstained has given me that wonderful feeling of why I love these games. IGA delivered in spades when it came to this game, and I can't wait to see what he brings us in the future.",Recommended
"This is like an upgraded GBA Castlevania RPG.  If you liked those, you should try this.",Recommended
"Where do I begin?\n\n-The magic system is similar to Castlevania: Aria of Sorrow, but on a heaping bucket of steroids. Upgrading rank may affect how many projectiles they produce, the size of their effect, or can even modify it with new animations / abilities altogether. Nearly every spell is viable, which is a difficult design feat to accomplish imo.\n\n-Very tight controls. Gameplay feels GREAT!\n\n-Basically all equipment except body armor affects your visual appearance. On top of that there is a lot of hairstyles, skin colors (like blue djinn color), etc.\n\n-A metric ton of weapons, that mostly all have different attack types (or at the very least different swing arcs).\n\nI could go on. I think I got my money's worth in the first night when I played for about 4 hours. It really is an amazing piece of work, and I have yet to be let down in almost any aspect. \n\nBasically a 10/10 game, a score I don't give very often. If you like metroidvanias, you will NOT be disappointed.\n\nsidenote: toy boots & voice changer are hilarious items.\n\nedit: weapon techniques are AWESOME.\n\nedit2: It's more a 9 or 9.5/10 since the story isn't exactly perfection by any means. But the gameplay is fantastic and that's the most important aspect in a game like this.",Recommended

"Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night is the “spiritual successor” to Castlevania: Symphony of the Night, and if that sounds like something you are interested in it shouldn't be missed. It's exactly what you think it is: explore a gothic castle, fight demons and an assortment of strange creatures, level up and gain equipment and abilities that will allow you to progress deeper into the castle... Repeat until the credits roll. Aside from some aesthetic differences and slight changes/additions to the tried and Recommended “Metroidvainia” formula, the game is on par with what you expect from learning: “The director of Symphony Kickstarted a game in 2015.”\n\n  You play as Miriam, a Shardbearer who was destined to be ritually sacrificed to ward off a demonic invasion that occurs every ten years. Right before this was scheduled, she fell into a mysterious slumber which prevented someone from stabbing her to death for some reason. When she awakens with a slight case of amnesia the Hellspawn have indeed infested her version of eighteenth century England, and she takes it upon herself to find a way to rid the world of darkness. That involves slaying thousands of creatures, plundering cathedrals, and ingesting crystal shards to increase her power. \n\n  The plot is more complicated than it has any reason to be. Besides a handful of short cutscenes using the game engine, dialogue between characters is delivered through decent voice-over with static, hand-drawn portraits. This would be more than fine if the interactions were snappy and brief, but the high frequency of exposition only serves to bog the game down. Exploration is the be-all and end-all of this genre, so trying to hold mental notes of the map, remembering which door needs which key and where you need to backtrack... Then being stopped dead in your tracks to listen to ten minutes of nigh-incomprehensible drama about Enochian text and crystal shards does nothing to keep your flow going. I couldn't quite bring myself to hit the “Skip Scene” button, but I checked out within an hour.\n\n  The sheer amount of options at your disposal is impressive. Dozens of armor, weapon, and cosmetic collectibles can be crafted, purchased, or found in the castle. Then you obtain a massive list of Shards on top of that, which range from passive abilities like increasing your damage output to special traversal techniques you will need to progress or access the many secret areas in the game. These upgrades are handed out so often it almost becomes overwhelming. I just found an offensive and defensive Shard combination that worked for me and stuck with it for the majority of the game, upgrading them when I could. Optimizing your abilities and equipping the right ones to exploit enemy weaknesses is probably required on the harder difficulties, but on Normal having ghostly paintings surround you while you project a giant drill though walls works ninety-nine percent of the time.\n\n  That's not to say Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night is easy. It's not. I'm positive I died more times on the first major boss than I did in the entirety of Symphony of the Night. Standard enemies will drain your health bar at an alarming rate, and the action does feel a little stiff. The 3-D assets can be extremely difficult to read on the 2-D plane you are playing, leading to missed jumps and misjudging your attack range. The deadliest attack many of the bosses possess is walking into you while you try to decipher exactly what you're looking at. Graphically Bloodstained is not a bad looking game, but it's a bit busy and colorful to the detriment of it's gameplay. Thankfully you can level yourself up and win wars of attrition if needed, but I never felt like I was in complete control of Miriam. Some spotty hit detection and enemies frequently clipping through walls doesn't help things.\n\n  While clearing out the massive map is pure, nostalgic comfort, there are a few instances I ran into that were much too esoteric for my liking. It's fantastic that secrets and Easter eggs are plentiful, but on more than one occasion I was forced to consult walkthroughs and forums because the main path was at a standstill. Upon reading the solutions, I didn't feel like I had cheated myself at all... Some key items are easily missable, certain “clues” won't even trigger in NPC dialogue if you don't explore in a “proper” order, and even then the instructions given to you are more akin to Castlevania 2: Simon's Quest than anything. If you don't plan on playing Bloodstained for the rest of your life, have an internet tab handy...\n\n  Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night is janky in places, decidedly low-budget for it's scope, and is weighed down by some unnecessary bloat like planting and harvesting corn. It does scratch that Symphony of the Night itch, though. If you enjoy squinting at a map, searching for that one door you didn't go through ten hours ago, Bloodstained is what you are looking for.",Recommended
"I'm still waiting for a Symphony of the Night release on PC, which will probably never happen, but now I can console myself with its legitimate heir.",Recommended
"A Recommended successor to Castlevania, just wishing there were more modes to play (for example, as another character, maybe in a DLC?)",Recommended
"Was not a backer but have been following the game since the beginning. Lives up to the hype and then some. If I had the money, I would buy again just to support the passionate creators behind this masterpiece.",Recommended
"The more I explore, the more I like this game! Iga and the team acted on feedback, delayed as necessary, and produced something that was every bit as good as I could have hoped. A lot of developers could stand to learn from ArtPlay on this one.  As a Kickstarter backer, I couldn't be happier with it.\n\n\nEdit: I beat the game and just didn't want to stop playing, so I went for the 100%. If you have any love for Castlevania, I can't recommend this game enough.",Recommended
"When I backed Bloodstained years ago, I hoped it would become this. It took some extra time to get here, but it was well worth the wait. I don't review a lot of games, but this treasure is worth it. The team heard the criticisms and made needed improvements to the game.\n\nAs a result - the art is wonderful, the level design is fantastic, the music is amazing, and the controls are precise.\n\nIGA made a promise, and IGA delivered.",Recommended
"It's Symphony of the Night, but prettier. I'm not disappointed. \n\nThe best part - the combat. There is a ton of fun variety. I've been watching people stream this game too, and everyone has picked a different fighting style. \n\nThe worst part - the game has glitched out on me a few times.",Recommended
"This is basically Symphony of the Night 2, mixed with bits and pieces of EVERY metroidvania game released on the GBA (CotM, HoD, AoS) and DS (DoS, PoR, OoE).\n\nThis game doesn't even make an effort to hide that it's a Castlevania game with Metroid elements produced by Koji Igarashi, they embrace it, and it works to amazing degrees, those of you that played any of the GBA or DS games above will recognize a lot of similar elements, but you know what?\n\n""It just works"" Todd Howard\n\nAbsolute recommend to metroidvania fans, this is a game made by fans for the fans.",Recommended
This just set the standard for future Metrodvania games.,Recommended
"The Good\n\n- There is a lot of good music in this game that gets you in the mood of kicking demon ass.\n- Controls are tight and responsive.\n- There's a lot of little things to do to make Miriam stronger and ease the war against evil. I really enjoy the whole cooking aspect that gives permanent bonuses to stats.\n- It's lengthy enough for a metroidvania game and who knows what the DLC's bring with them once they are released. Oh and they are going to be free.\n- A huge variety of equipment and spells.\n\nThe Bad\n\n- Bugs/Glitches. Items get stuck and can't be picked up even with the auto-pick up shard. Some problems in water areas with animations getting stuck in place. I experienced one crash and after that i made sure i had saved my game before i read any books. I've heard of other bugs as well. Hopefully these get fixed in the future.\n- I had to check online where i was supposed to go next a few times later on in the game. I might be wrong but i don't think i skipped any important dialogue and spent a lot of time searching for the right unexplored room to advance. Turns out the right place was in one of the earliest areas in the game and you were supposed to use a skill you got from a boss. A little later when i got the ability to flip things around, i suspected i had to find some random room and use it to be able to continue. I consulted internet and what do you know, i would have spent an eternity trying to find the correct place. I don't need an arrow pointing me to the next objective but a little text box or something in the pause menu giving me a hint would have been nice a few times.\n- I would have preferred pixel graphics. It was so much easier to tell where the hitboxes were on the older metroidvania games. I swear i've gotten hit by thin air quite a few times in RotN.\n- Overall the animations are bad in my opinion. There are things that look very good but most of the time things just look awkward and clunky. Another reason why simpler graphics would have worked better.\n\nIt's a good game. Not great. Good. Bugs need to go and DLC needs to bring more content to the main game. Not just different minigame modes like the Boss Rush. A minor buyer's remorse because of it's price. I enjoyed Hollow Knight slightly more and that game is 15€.\n\n7.5/10",Recommended
It's Castlevania but not.,Recommended
"Not much of a review writer, but as a huge castlevania fan (especially order of ecclesia, which is kinda relevant for this game). This game delivers, a lot. I'm not much for kickstarters, so I didn't back there. However I have no regrets buying this game at all, I cleared all achievements (which to be fair isn't very difficult, just takes a little bit of time). But as a castlevania successor this game is amazing, it's every bit as good as every castlevania out there, with some much needed QoL changes that make it a lot easier to play, like switching between preset gear and skillsets on the fly. \n\nAs for the actual game, it starts out decently difficult on normal, with you becoming pretty damn op pretty quick and by he end of the game nothing can stop you, especially once you get your hands on certain combo's. I have yet to finish hard mode, but it's a lot more difficult so far. The gameplay is a mix between symphony, dawn and mostly ecclesia. Interesting story, beautiful music, magnificent art and level design, nice and dark lore as well, fitting for the successor of castlevania.\n\nIn closing, if you are into things like Castlevania/metroidvania's this is game of the year material, at least for it's genre, so buy it, you will not regret it. 9/10.",Recommended
The first crowd funded game to live up to expectations. Kinda wish there was some more graphical polish making it looks more hand drawn but other than that I don't have any real complaints. At times the game is pretty directionless and it's easy to get lost.,Recommended
"This is the only game I've ever backed on Kickstarter. I knew the risks and kept my expectations low.\n\nI'm very pleased to say this might be my game of the year.\n\nIs it perfect? Hell no. Miriam still screams with every attack like it's women's tennis. The characters are still uncanny valley in dialogue cut-scenes. And the dialogue itself is occasionally cringe.\n\nBut it is pure, '90s kid fun. Other 'vanias like Hollow Knight might objectively be a better game in terms of depths and challenge, but I enjoy this more. Bosses require a bit of observation but aren't rage-inducing. Farming for gear is optional but rewarding. The map is big but not confusing.\n\nWith NG+ & the DLCs, I can easily see this being a 100+ hour game. And that doesn't include offline time spent listening to the gorgeous soundtrack.",Recommended

What a horrible night to have a curse!\n\nps. I recommend you use JP voice (if you understand Japanese) because the English translate are a bit off and sometimes not make sense.",Recommended
awesome game! castlevania nostalgia!,Recommended
"Bosses can be extremely hit or miss and sometimes the exact thing to do next ain't very clear, but overall I had an absolute blast and am looking forward to all the additional good stuff that's still to come to this already very complete package",Recommended
"I'm about 5 hours into this game, and when it works it has the makings of a great Igavania game, however, in it's current state I can't recommend it.  I've fought 4 bosses so far, and 2 of them completely glitched making them trivial.  The 2nd boss glitched and did not move after the first couple attacks, and the 4th boss I got stuck through the floor and wound up behind the boss where it couldn't hit me.  I have also crashed 3-4 times, and in a game without quicksave or checkpoints, that is a major time loss each time it happens.  I want to love this game, but right now it's at an early access level, not a complete game.",Not Recommended
"Major props for Mr. Igarashi for turning this much delayed project around and proving his detractors wrong!\nThe game is a lot of fun and well worth the money. All though the artstyle could be better, here's to hoping the planned sequel improves on what's already built in this very solid foundation of a game.",Recommended

Castlevania in all but name.,Recommended
"This game is a treasure.\n\nIf you're new or seasoned to the metroidvania genre, I highly recommend this. It's fun, lengthy for the first playthrough, and has some nice additions for speedrunners. Not to mention all the free DLC coming our way later, Igarashi and his team really outdid themselves. The passion poured into this is clear.\n\nIf you grew up with SotN, this game is more than recommended, it is required. It is imperative. It reminded me of how much I loved it and all the surprises it had. This game does play very, very similarly to SotN + Aria of Sorrow. That said, it takes the best elements of both and combines them into something fresh. I had fun just making Miriam into an utter monster through the permanent food bonuses, permanent skills, and grinding them out to make the Nightmare difficulty a breeze, solely for the pleasure of playing it and mastering the timing all over again. [spoiler]The Accelerator shard you get towards the end of the game is the most fun I've had playing a metroidvania literally ever, and actually makes you want to replay on higher difficulty.[/spoiler]\n\nI could gush about this game, but much of it has been said already and needn't be restated again, with the exception of my undying gratitude for the creators of this game. Thank you so much. But no, I want to point out something else that I don't think the internet has caught onto yet. \n\n[spoiler]Iga: I see you calling out Sakurai. At first I thought, as a Smash player, I'm just seeing signs where they're not. If you uncovered this spoiler, get ready for some John Madden shit.\n\nThe coins bearing the Smash emblem, the silver one with a snake around it--Snake, voiced by David Hayter, is in your game and in Smash--coincidence? The gold coin bearing two dots, representing the echo fighter (or perhaps two characters, Alucard and Miriam). Another coincidence? Maybe.\n\nThen I beat OD/Alucard and went back to his room. He's wearing a mask? I did just beat him up. Wait a second...\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/SRwDA1z\n\nThat's a Waluigi nose and mustache mask. The nose is a different color and the 'stache has an additional bend on it, but it is otherwise identical in length and angle all around.\n\nAnd neither character is going to acknowledge its existence.\n\n... You slick bastard.\n\nAlucard is an assist trophy already in Smash. I have expressed my displeasure at this ever since the release video of Richter, where they show Alucard as an assist. I was so mad. Waluigi is best known in Smash for being the meme of a character that will never get a spot in Smash.\n\nI don't know what you're trying to say here, be it an expression of your own displeasure, a statement of unfortunate fact, a callout to Sakurai himself or--wishful thinking--an easter egg spoiler of things to come long since agreed upon in the shadows, but whatever the case, I see you referencing Smash and equating Alucard to Waluigi, and I love you even more for it. Man after my own heart.[/spoiler]",Recommended

I gotta say the past few months waiting for this game were almost torture. Then the game finally comes out and man i can't begin to express how much joy i felt playing this game. It has been years since a game enthralled me to such an extent. Also the first game in a long time where i felt compelled to get every achievement. This game is worth it in every sense of the word.

Should have a better difficulty progression.\n- Progression in the game is hindered by obscure tips. You need to pay a lot of attention to tips that get told to you only ONCE and then scout all over the map to find an item that will allow you to progress.\n- Has tons of hidden references and attention to detail. Loved those things.\n- On some parts it looks like IGA copy pasted his old game design and just updated the graphics. Some areas, items, weapons and skills are IDENTICAL to previous games.\n\nWould recommend for sure to any metroidvania fans.\nOthers might want to check reviews first.\n\n.",Recommended

"TL;DR:\nA glowing recommendation to everybody who likes metroidvanias. Even as a skeptic when it comes to kickstarter projects, this is by and far the best outcome out of one of those campaigns to date. Buy it or at least put it on your wishlist.\n\nWhat a wonderful game! I only experienced the metroid-style castlevania games (SOTN, the Sorrow games, etc) in the past few years, so I didn't particularly care for the kickstarter back in 2015. That said, as a non-backer, I am 100% satisfied. Having just finished my first playthrough after about 12 hours, I was having fun throughout, gathering abilities and equipment, getting comfortable with the castle's layout and learning the enemies' patterns.\n\nA few minor nitpicks I've experienced:\n[list]\n[*] Before you get more movement abilities, some of the platforming felt just a tad too precise. I got used to it after a while, but it was kinda annoying to fall down a tower after painstakingly climbing it because I've misjudged where the platform ended.\n[*] There are three kinds of very basic sidequests: finding somebody in the castle, crafting (or finding) a certain item, and killing a certain number of enemies. Obviously sidequests aren't necessarily what you play metroidvanias for, but I thought I'd at least mention it. Fighting, collecting and exploring are the focus.\n[*] The visual style is not perfect, which I can totally live with given the budget and focus on gameplay, but some people might be under the impression that a current-gen castlevania successor should be polished par brilliance. Like I said, I don't mind it, and it is a very stylish game, but especially the human characters had an air of... how to put it... ""PSP era"" qualities to them.\n[*] The shopkeeper will sometimes, but not in a predictable manner, tell you in general terms where to go next, but I still got a bit lost from time to time. I personally made it through, but I think maybe an option to make those hints clearer, like the puzzle difficulty adjustment for the SH series, as well as choosing when to get the info rather than relying on a chance to get the hint might have been a more accomodating way to handle this.\n[/list]\n\nAgain, these are absolutely minor gripes, I decided to post these instead of the list of pros because then we'd be here all day. I can only wholeheartedly recommend this game to anybody who has ever found enjoyment in the dungeon crawler or metroidvania genres.\n\nPS: The IGA Back Pack is a nice bonus for fans and those who want to support the company, as I now have, but is just an (admittedly really nice) extra boss fight. If you're really worried about price to value, I'd recommend you skip it.\n\nPPS: This is disregarding all post-launch content. I don't even care. I've spent €35.99 and I'm absolutely satisfied that I've already got my money's worth, anything that comes after this is just a bonus for me.",Recommended
"By all means, this is a modern interpretation of the old Castlevania games, and especially Castlevania Symphony of the night. This game takes all positive elements of the Castlevania series that fans know and love and absolutely expands on them. With similar abilities, spells, weaponry, and even familiars. You'll find the reminiscent enemies, bosses, and secrets hidden within the walls of the castle. I haven't even backed this game in kickstarter, but the day I picked it up I could not put it down. I spent 3 whole days playing this game, got 100% map completion, max level, and finished the game thoroughly and I STILL want to play it over again. I picked this game up ON A WHIM without even knowing what it was and I was more than pleasantly surprised.\n\nFor my endgame setup, I used a chisel throwing spell, skull necklace, risk ring, and int boost level 9 (for faster casting) to melt everything.\n\nThis game is bar FAR worth $40 (though I got a 10% discount) and you know what the best part is? This game is finished but has MORE in game content and playable characters to experience in the future. Thank you for this wonderful experience Koji Igarashi.

"After Konami soiled itself by turning their oldest IP's into a effing pachinko machines, modern Castlevania creator Koi Igarashi decided to take maters into his own hands. As a result we now have Bloodstained, another crowdfunded success story.\n\nWhile everyone heard about legendary Symphony of the Night, handheld titles such as Aria/Dawn of Sorrow are now considered as one of the most polished titles in series. Bloodstained borrows heavily from them, while adding a robust layer of complexity in player customization.\n\nEverything you would expect from Metroidvania is here. There are mountains of weapons and weird monsters to test them on, item shops, save rooms (this time — really close to boss rooms), teleport rooms, secret rooms, sequence breaking, puzzles etc. Even map looks exactly like you would expect. Where Bloodstained stands out however is more player-friendly approach to build customization. You can freely swap to entirely different loadouts with gear and skill presets. Perhaps you want one build for general exploration, or item farm, or XP farm, or glass-cannon-kill-boss-ASAP build. This saves so much time on tedious menu-hopping. There is also pretty robust crafting system present, where you can manufacture everything from armor, weapons and jewelry, to various types of food for stat upgrades.\n\nBloodstained received some major graphic overhaul few months before release and sadly — it shows. At best, I can say that presentation wise it is very uneven. Some places look fantastic, while others feel like they could use another polish.\n\nThis game is everything that was promised and it does execute classic formula very well. Good old Castlevania, almost a decade after last proper game.\n\nRecommended",Recommended

This is the Symphony of the Night sequel we've all been asking for and deserve.,Recommended
best game after castle vania: sotn\nits like new and improved castle vania..,Recommended
"If you enjoyed Castlevania SoTN, you will enjoy this.",Recommended
"Man, I needed this in my life. It plays a lot like Aria of Sorrow and if you like metroidvanias this one is not to be missed.",Recommended
"Ótimo jogo, seja pra quem já é fã de Castlevania, seja pra quem é novo nesse ""estilo"". Jogo difícil na medida certa. Tu morre mas não necessariamente quer arrebentar o controle haha.\nVale cada centavo! No aguardo das free DLCs agora.",Recommended
"If you like Symphony of the Night, you'll like this game as well. I mean this in more than one way though. It isn't just similar to SotN. It's pretty much a remake, with Aria/Dawn of Sorrow's soul system included. 8 out of 10 areas are more or less the same, design wise. You have your clock tower, your underground cavern, your library, your citadel, etc. etc. Now don't get me wrong, I absolutely LOVE this game. It just felt a bit too much like SotN. It kind of feels like the game they WANTED to make around SotN's time but couldn't, so they made it now. I give this game a 9.9 out of 10. the minus 0.1 is due to the similarities being a bit too much. There's even more patterns that are the same, but that would include spoilers, which I'm not willing to do.\n\nI know it won't be for years, if at all, but I really.. REALLY REALLY hope they make a sequel. Would like a game just like this, only without the exact same structure as SotN. I mean, after all, when you know exactly what do to next because you played a DIFFERENT game, you can't help but feel like it's too similar.",Recommended
"this game is the BEST since SOTN and Now This ? WONDERFUL~ games like this shall exists more than any other crap games , best collecting , Soundtrack and even change characters looks , Damn i love it , hoping for more games like this one , keep it up !",Recommended
This is my first metroidvania style game and it was damn good. I was hooked from beginning to end. I strongly recommend it.,Recommended
"I'm a backer of this game and I was prepared to be disappointed, but I have to admit that Igarashi and his team have delivered. This is exactly the game they said they would make and exactly the game I wanted. Are you looking for a great Castlevania-style game? You've found it.",Recommended
"I'm a huge fan of all the Metroid titles. I tried most of the Metroidvanias on PC out there and they just didn't compare, yes even Hollow Knight was dissapointing. \n\nBut when I played SoTN I knew this was the Metroid-like game I was looking for. Bloodstained is SoTN 2.0, addicting gameplay, huge castle, little bit of farming for materials, badass music, epic boss fights, it has it all.\n\nMy only complaint is weapons are garbage compared to magic which is a bit lame you never really get to use your sword or mace because magic just outclasses it in everway possible.\n\nIf you're a fan of Metroid or Castlevania this is a MUST BUY",Recommended
"[h1]Praise and nitpicks from a mainly satisfied Igavania fan[/h1]\nI backed this when it was first announced on kickstarter and I have been a fan of Symphony of the Night and the other Igavania games for roughly half my life. I was not disappointed. Though the many delays and changes were frustratring, I think the finished product is highly polished and well worth the wait. I find that the game is a pleasant mix between nostalgia and new elements, and I was continuously surprised by how concepts from older Igavania games have been innovated or given an original twist.\n\nAs a big fan of the gimmick from Aria/Dawn of Sorrow and Order of Ecclesia where you collect and use the powers of monsters, I feel like Bloodstained has taken the best of this concept and improved upon it with the ability to upgrade shards and sell off your surpluss. This increases the value of defeating old enemies whilst backtracking, and adding to this are the respawning silver treasure chests. Bloodstained does a lot to make the backtracking more rewarding, which I think will be appreciated both by fans and enemies of the backtracking in other Igavania games.\n\nTaking my time to leisurely explore and doing a minor amount of grinding, it took me roughly 31 hours to complete the game on Normal mode for my first run-through. I had two crashes during that time, and otherwise have not experienced any bugs or glitches.\n\nI did note a handful of typos or missing words, and on three or four occasions the text dialogue did not match up with the audio dialogue. That's as far as my technical issues with the game go. Keyboard and mouse control are not nearly as bad as I feared they would be after playing the backer demo and the retro prequel, but the user interface implies heavily that the game is intended to be played with a controller. As someone who grew up playing on console and only made the switch to PC gaming a few years ago, I found the keyboard controls acceptably comfortable with some minor reconfiguration.\n\nI thought my major gripe would be with the underwater mechanics, but you eventually unlock an ability that vastly improves the underwater movement and combat, before actually needing to deal much with the underwater areas.\n\nAt this point, having just finished my first run-through, the only thing I am really missing a lot in this game is the ability to upgrade gear, in addition to crafting. I would have liked to be able to improve the armours, accessories and weapons I have, since a lot of the better items have visuals that I don't enjoy. I spent much of the game wearing comical glasses because they had the best stats. I don't mind looking goofy during 'serious' cutscenes, but there were a lot of cute or cool items I never wore because they simply had no benefits. An alternative fix to this would be glamour slots, like in Terraria, where you can wear one armour for stats and one armour for visuals. This is especially relevant since only one item I came across will change the appearance of Miriam's default dress. That said, I am very happy with the customisation options for hair, skin, eyes and clothing colour. I was missing a white dye option, and would have liked to be able to unlock more dye options over time. This brings me back to item glamours/gear enhancement; there is one scarf you can dye, but it does not have the best stats, so what is the point?\n\nThere are also mechanics around the shards that could be explained better, such as the difference between rank and grade and what the shard's grade affects. But all in all, this is a very beautiful and very addictive Igavania style game that I hope will go on to see a lot more love and DLC (hopefully even sequels?) in the future.",Recommended
If you are a fan of the Castlevania series. Bloodstained as the spiritual successor to it lived up to the hype. It was able to offer the best of the Castlevania Series. On a side note hoping for a bigger map (seems a bit small compared to the previous games.. here's hoping for an expansion/DLC !),Recommended
Its everything I was looking for in a game. Unfortunantly the xbox controller stopped working for it. Unless i get a fix soon I don't think I can deal with this,Not Recommended
"Finished the game with 15 hours in game.  The game is solid for 35 bucks (I bought the game for 20 bucks) . It's a solid 7/10\n\nGraphic: Can't ask more, the graphic is on point. I do have the feel of old style and modern at the same time. Bring back so much memory :) \n\nSound: I like the ost, but honestly they just repeat the same  every time. So I was listening to music instead\n\nGameplay:  A LOT OF BUGS.  I meet raw 6-7 bugs such as graphic bug, item drop on the air bug, headless Mirana and many more.  They did patched it in next ver, but the item graphic still there.  \n\nGame has very few interaction, and POORLY telling you what to do. Most of people compare this to SOTN but please this is 2K19. Not many people play game and enjoy spending 3-5 hours looking WHERE TO GO.  We are in the 2k19, Good game is the one with friendly Interaction. So player can feel reward, or don't feel any lost.   \n\nGame pass on my most idea type of RPG, they have side quest, dungeon crawling type.  Doing side quest, grind items-> craft shit to be better. Very simple, yet very rewarded and effective.  The beauty of 2D.5 style, yet the majority what you do in game is fighting demon and collecting their shard - A very interesting mechanic, allow you to strength and explore your style- as well as level up to get better stats.   Boss design also very good, they are unique yet will give you a very challenge fight on Hard difficulty even you think you get good gear.\n\nVerdict:  The control keyboard support IS TERRIBLE. This game is meant to play on controller, though I do appreciate if they can add the KB support if they want to release on steam. \n\nI find myself spend 15 hours into the game, sometime I lost because I dk what to do and have to use FAQ ask question. But overall I like the game and would give it 7/10 :)",Recommended
Like the game alot. like the exploration. hidden area. and collecting shard.,Recommended
"Great game.\n\nIf you love Metroidvenia-genre games you need to get this.\nThere is a lot to do, a lot to explore, a lot to grind (if you are into that) and a lot of love put into this project.\nThe cutscenes are a bit weird looking because the animation are weird in them but the gameplay and the animations during gameplay feel just right.\nIf you ever played any castlevania you will love this.\n\nMy only issue is, that some weapons, like firearms, need a bit of balancing but that's where my complains stop. \n\nCurrently working on 100%ing the game after clearing the final boss, still having a blast.\n\n[list]\n[*]Gameplay 9/10 but with that Castlevanian feel that has been missing for ages, so 10/10 for some people. \n(Weapons need a bit of rebalancing) \n(Techniques feel difficult to pull of and don't feel that rewarding. They are however not needed to complete the game)\n(The gameplay feels good and ""just right"" anyways.)\n[*]Story 8/10. A game that has a story, if it's good or not is for you to decide. The lore of the universe is dope though.\n[*]Art 9/10. 2.5D Graphics pushed to their limits with the budget and time that was available. Looks stunning but there are a few textures here and there that overlap. Nothing gamebreaking.\n[*]Soundtrack 10/10. Awesome Orchestral score for every biome.\n[*]Map design 8/10. A lot of reasons to go back to older maps with new powers to find something hidden. Absolutely great to revisit older parts of the map. Only downside is, that there is no more Map left after ~15-20 hours.\n[/list]\n\nMy personal enjoyment of this title is immense and I just want more and more of this game. There are some DLCs in the works because of Kickstarter goals. I have high hopes, that these will be meaningfull additions to the game.\n\n\nA Controller is recommended but not neccessary. You can absolutely play this game with Mouse+Keyboard.",Recommended
This game will restore your faith in the wonder and magic of what video games can be. \n\nIt is essentially a love letter to the aesthetics of 90's gaming which both old and new players will be able to appreciate.\n\nHighly recommended.,Recommended
"**DO NOT BUY THE DLC IF YOU ARE BUYING THE GAME DIRECTLY (what it adds to the game is minimal at best, even if it's content that was originally backer exclusive)** \n\nThat being said, Bloodstained is an absolutely wonderful game. Kept me glued to my screen for 60+ hours and I haven't even started Hard or Nightmare modes yet. Very reminiscent of more modernized Castlevania games such as Symphony of the Night, Dawn of Sorrow, and Order of Ecclesia. Great voice acting, tons of references, and a slew of weapons and spells to keep you entertained.",Recommended
"If you love Castlevania, you will love this game.",Recommended
"Absolutely incredible.\n\nI've played Symphony of the Night, Aria of Sorrow, Dawn of Sorrow, Harmony of Dissonance, Portrait of Ruin and Order of Ecclesia. Castlevania has been one of my favorite series for such a very, very long time. It hurts to say that this might be better than all of them. There's so much love and care put into it. It feels like a game from another era with how much vision and passion floods every single aspect, as opposed to the corporate focus-tested trash that floods the market nowadays. \n\nIt's not perfect -- no game is. But its charm and ambition is more than enough to cover its flaws.",Recommended
"Totally Dracula X Symphony of the night CLONE and when i say CLONE i really mean it.. same enemies, weapons, animations, familiars (even some characters). Even same secrets....",Recommended
"It's basically the perfect Castlevania game. If you're a fan of Symphony of the Night or Aria of Sorrow, then this is that, but a bit better, and in 2.5D. The game is incredibly fun, the music is phenomenal, it has well-designed bosses, lots of weapon options, and is up there as one of the best Metroidvania games I've played.",Recommended
"I normally don't write reviews but I felt compelled to for this game alone.  This game is absolutely amazing so far!  Granted, I'm only 3 hours into it but just the sheer amount of attention to details and other things I've noticed makes this feel like a love letter to SotN.  I'll be back once I finish the game for a full review but so far I'm loving what I'm playing right now!",Recommended
Really fun and deep metroidvania style game. I loved symphony of the night back in the day and this feels very similar to that playstylle.,Recommended
"This game just feels right. As a Castlevania fan (my favorites being SoTN, AoS and OoE), I cannot recommend this game more highly. \n\nIt has elements mixed in from all three games. A large map to explore, a Soul-system, a large variety of weapons to choose from, side-quests and crafting. For those that don't enjoy side quests, the game doesn't go out of its way to make you do them, and most of them are cleared simply by progressing and beating enemies. \n\nIt's a great modernization of the formula. Cutscenes are rough, but the voice acting is surprisingly good. The visuals might be hit or miss, but I personally love how some of the colors in this game shine. Aesthetics. \n\nBloodstained: [strike] Symphony [/strike] Ritual of the Night is an amazing game.",Recommended
"EDIT: Can probably ignore most mentions of bugs, as recent patches have fixed most of them. Changed my review to a recommend as the bugs were the main issue I had with the game.  \n  \nGreat game, but in it's current state it crashes often enough to make me not want to continue playing, alongside progression stopping/slowing bugs such as items falling through the ground or just not being interactable(cant be picked up for 15sec to a full minute after dropping). \n\nThere is also a distinct lack of information in the game, with basic character stats having zero explanation of their purpose anywhere and some combos being hidden(no way of knowing how to do them, not even bookcases that tell you how to do them, other than trial and error).\nMost items are pretty vague in their description with things like ""increases frequency of critical strikes"" but no way of knowing by how much so you cant tell if its even worth it or not.  \n  \nTLDR; Id say the game overall is really damn good, just held back by some outdated design choices(omitting basic information just because thats how old games were) and some bugs, such as items not being collectible after dropping, random crashing/freezing and the game ALWAYS launching on your second monitor if you have multiple.  \nPurchase at risk of your own sanity, possibly wait for a patch or 2 to fix some of the above issues.",Recommended

"So, as many people here, I don't usually do reviews of the good games I play, but Bloodstained deserves all the praise it can get. A lot of games today don't quite gives me as much fun and nostalgia as Ritual Of The Night. \nThe art and graphics are just beautiful, using Unreal Engine was a great choice form the developers and the visuals are just gorgeous. \nThe music: god damn amazing. For those that loved Symphony Of The night and such, you'll be awed in each new area that you discover. The music fits the location every time and is just beautiful to listen to. \nThe story in itself is quite basic but still decently written and varied for a game where you bash enemies most of the time while trying to level up your character etc... \nThe gameplay now. Oh dear Jesus it is Goooood! The flexibility in character customisation is pretty darn awesome and varied. I won't spoil much here, because discovering new mechanics is also part of the joy in that game, but you just always find a power or weapons that is quite unique and refreshing. All spears don't attack the same, all sword don't strike the same way. You even have some tekken/street fighter like techniques for most of the weapons, which are unique to each of them and gives even more variety to the gameplay. \n\nA lot of good for any gamer in this game, even for first time players that are not especially old nostlagia guys like all the fans of the Castlevania series ;) \n\nBUY - THIS - GAME\n\n\n",Recommended
"This game is so much fun and lives up to it's expectations. I noticed people experiencing crashes but luckily I haven't had any!  I will be doing a more detailed review after I finish the game, but overall so far so good. It is worth the buy. Do it.",Recommended

"Game is far more than I had hoped or expected, especially for a kickstarter style game.  Phenomenal!\n\n",Recommended
"You will either love or hate the art design, but the gameplay and everything else in between is amazing. The size of the content is massive, and there's a lot to discover and follow-up on for absolute completionists.\n\nAll of this said, I hope Igarashi gets to make another one of these, but with more polish and a less-divisive art style. Definitely worth paying for full price, but even better that it's 10 percent off.",Recommended
"This game gets so much right. As a spin-off to symphony of the night so much feels like it was taken right out and improved, Small things, like moving the dash button to the shoulder button, and huge things like the weapon play, shards, and the fact that there are multiple areas such as ships and villages in one big map. Every single addition put in this game feels like its meant to be there, and I honestly have not found a single flaw yet, besides the fact that the game crashed once, and that trying to bunny hop gave me carpal tunnel",Recommended
buy ittttttttt,Recommended
Very good game. some bugs but not game breaking.,Recommended
I bought this game on steam and I had a sore back that needed rest so i could not play it for long. Ended up buying on my xbox one aswell to play in bed. Amazing game and worth every cent!,Recommended
"So Bloodstained gets a recommendation from me because the game play is fantastic.However everything else about the game is fine at best to mediocre at the worst. Whole bunch of random bugs, model and texture quality varies wildly, at least two points where there is no indication of how to progress, etc.",Recommended
"Anyone who has played a Metroidvania style game knows exactly what they should feel like, and Bloodstained absolutely nails it.\n\nEveryone keeps drawing Symphony comparisons and rightfully so, but know before you dive in: this game plays more like Aria of Sorrow/Dawn of Sorrow, with the Enemy Skills you obtain through Shards being a major component of gameplay. \n\nCannot recommend this enough if you've enjoyed a Castlevania game in the past 20 years.",Recommended
This is just what I had been waiting for since Order of Ecclesia. I hope Iga keeps making these games.,Recommended
"This game is Iga's love-letter to Symphony of the Night. If you loved that game or any of the GBA-DS Castlevania titles, you will love this game as well.\n\nKonami believes Castlevania is dead; let's help IGA prove they are wrong!",Recommended
"Great game. Definitely up there with Aria of Sorrow and SoTN! Base difficulty felt a bit easy at times, but the game itself is still very enjoyable since each run can be different based on luck with enemy drops. Fightstick recommended if you got one, but that could just be personal preference since most Metroidvanias / Platformers just feel really comfy with arcade buttons.",Recommended
"Feels and plays like a modern Castlevania game (SotN to OoE).\nBuy it.\n\nWhat I want in a future new release:\n* A bigger bestiary (will happen eventually)\n* More unique enemy room patterns\n* Improved enemy behaviors (things that happens when they don't see you, silly attacks)\n* Better animations\n* Less wax\n* Skeletons\n(will update if something is missing)",Recommended
"I feel compelled to say something for this game.\nThe reason I bought this game was because I saw the trailer where the developers and Iga looked at criticisms given to them by others, then improved the game on it. The amount of sincerity to make a good game shown in the trailer made me very interested in the game itself, and sure enough, the gameplay corresponds to the love put into the game.\n\nVery solid mechanics, very addictive gameplay, and as someone who has never played any metroidvania games nor igavania games in particular, this was my entry to the small subgenre, and I wasn't disappointed. The music and sound design is nothing to scoff at either, they work together with the engaging gameplay to keep you engrossed.\nAnd of course, I need to give credit to the punishing gameplay. What I mean by this is that usually in games I get very greedy. I explore too far too fast, I try to grab whatever I see, and I don't like to throw things away. In this game, there is no auto-save, so you have to make it to the save rooms to save your game, however, being the greedy little shit I am, I've died upteenth times by now just exploring new areas without saving, even having to fight a boss twice because I didn't save due to greediness.\n\nAlso, there are a ton of different weapons in this game, each offering a slightly different way for you to approach the combat, so you'll be able to find the one for you. This, combined with the shard system essentially creates a game whereby there's so many different mechanics and combinations for you to discover, and more that I myself have no idea about(yet, I'm still playing).\n\nFinally, I just want to say I paid almost full price for the game and I feel it's definitely worth it. This was a successful kickstarted game, and they delivered greatly, so support the developers and let them make more good stuff.\n\nNow excuse me while I go back to the game.",Recommended
FRIKN HELL THIS IS WHAT I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR MY WHOLE LIFE! \nTHANK YOUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU!,Recommended
"Wow, where do I even start. This game's got:\n- Amazing Gameplay\n- Amazing Music\n- Amazing Story\n- Amazing Weapon/Shard System\n- Amazing Protagonist and NPCs\n- David Hayter\n- (On that note) Excellent voice acting\n- Fun and interesting game mechanics both new and old to Metroidvania titles\n- A huge map to explore (It's frickin huge)\n- Very fluid animations for general movement, combat, and monsters\n- Secrets crammed in every corner (Quite literally in some cases)\n- Tons and tons of awesome weapons to wield\n- Many cool monsters, challenges, and puzzles to complete\n- Super cool, interesting and tough Bosses to fight\n- Made with love and devotion\n\nThere is so much more to the game than the list above. Any fan of Castlevania will love this game. You really aren't a Castlevania fan if you dislike this game. Iga did a wonderful job. Michiru Yamane is one of my favorite composers. I am sooo excited for the online play to come. I'm so excited for the 13 free DLC's to come. I am so excited to play this game with my friends and continue to play this game throughout the year.\n\nThank you Iga for following your dreams and doing what it takes to show your devotion to the fans. It takes a lot of courage and will to follow through on the things you love. Thank you for loving Castlevania enough to leave Konami and make what I hope continues to be a successful franchise! If you haven't bought this game, please do yourself a favor and give it a go! Even if you have never played a Castlevania game before, this is a good place to start.\n\nAnd as much good there is to be had, a good game does not come without it's flaws. There are a few glitches and things that made me chuckle and a little worried but nothing spectacular. One was when the seaman drug a Morte through the door in the opening scene instead of the Morte dragging the seaman. Another glitch was when I was fighting the [spoiler]Twin Dragons[/spoiler], I got smashed through the floor and was able to beat the boss from behind. And there are a few sound glitches, one in [spoiler]Glacial Tomb[/spoiler] sometimes when you use Accelerator Shard through the teleportation door the music wouldn't play. And when the [spoiler]Bael Boss[/spoiler] uses the electric attack as you give the final blow you can hear the electric sounds during the entire ending cut-scenes. I can imagine these will all be bugged out eventually.\n",Recommended
"i give this one a 3 outta 5\nit seems everyone else really likes this one but i just think its good but not great...\n\ngameplay is what to expect of castlevania successor, platforming, blugeoning, cool boss fights.\nsoundrack is really good though so theres that\n\nwait for a sale if u unsure",Recommended
"Incredibly good for what it is. Takes most of the best parts from SoTN, Aria, Dawn, Portrait, and Ecclesia and makes it into one game. A second game like this in a series would be even better without all the baggage from Kickstarter and the events happening by proxy in the 4 years it took to make this game.\n\nThe only complaints I have are ultimately minor.\n\n-I wish the castle was less horizontally spread out, as you get a less cohesive and connected map compared to if it ultimately ends up being squarish. Despite this being IGA's biggest castle, the Somavania castles feel more ""full"" and connected in comparison.\n-Some of the Kickstarter influences bleed out of the setting and experience a little. Things like the portraits are fine, but others like the dozen craftable backer weapons just stick out like a sore thumb. Why couldn't these be like rare drops spread out across the game instead of part of some checklist?\n-Some performance issues, but I assume with time these would get sorted out. I'd like to return to the days where transitioning between rooms was instant all the time, but this is the price they paid for 2.5D. Still not nearly enough to detract from how good the package is overall, though.",Recommended

"I did receive this game for free, as I had backed this on the original Kickstarter at the Collector's tier. Say what you will of my possible bias.\n\nSo for the quick and dirty, here's the Pro's and Cons, with a longer write-up for those that care or have time.\n\n[h1]Pros/Cons[/h1]\n[Pros]\n[*]Castlevania:SOTN spiritual successor directed and produced by genre creator, Koji Igarashi\n[*]Music composer Michiru Yamane\n[*]Built with Unreal Engine plays and looks very well (disregard art/design, as I'll make my points later)\n[*]Contains classic formula, reminiscent of Castlevania: SOTN, with updates and additions seen from the proceeding titles in the series. Ties in what made the series, while also using and improving on some of the mechanics used in previous games that Koji  Igarashi produced.\n[*]Multiple game modes (Classic Adventure with multiple difficulty modes, Boss Rush, Speed Run, and additional playable characters) to offer some replay value.\n[*]Solid 12+ hours of gameplay and content. Much longer if you scour for secrets, completion of side quests and item collections. Much shorter if you speed run it, obviously. As of this, I've sunk about 30+ hours from completing side quests and trying to 100% the collections.\n[/list]\n[Cons]\n[*]Minor bugs (more on this later)\n[*]Art&Design is not what many may appreciate. I'm listing this as this seems to be a common gripe. I can understand it on some aspects, but overall I think it's fine. There is a few things where it looks inconsistent, though I think this is mostly a knit pick.\n[*]Gameplay like Castlevania, which some players familiar with more modern games may not like as with the restrictions on attacks or how the story and progression is handled.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nPlainly, it's basically Castlevania:SOTN, all in but name. They got similar areas, characters, abilities and whatnot. There is an expanded system for spells and abilities via the ""shards"" which can make some interesting things that can in some ways break the game in terms of difficulty. There is also a ""techniques"" system for the weapons, so you have a bit more variety and options, which also helps make some weapons still relevant to collect/use unlike in Castlevania:SOTN or even like in COTM. There is crafting and ""cooking"" which can also add an additional level of stat improvements, which is another way to add a level of progression and power-leveling, and not regulate all stats via items.\n\nControls are fairly spot on, and reactive. My only complaint is the use of the Directional and Manipulation shards as they can feel a little awkward to use/activate. Would've like the options to ""toggle"" some of the Manipulation shards, instead of the ""press and hold"". Directional shards can be very useful given the ability to aim in all directions, but doing it while moving can be tricky, as you can only do so either using your movement direction to determine the direction, or using the aim control, which I found a bit hard to use on a controller, but surprisingly easier to do with a keyboard and mouse setup. Now, I say this as per the default controls. The game does allow a fairly large option for control configurations, so this point may be moot.\n\n[b]Bugs[/b]\nAs of this review, there are a few bugs that are pretty troublesome.\n\nOne being that when an enemy is killed along a wall or in terrain, the bag drop will ""float"" and you will not be able to collect it unless you make sure you're underneath where it would drop to, or be within range. This will take about 5-10 seconds of standing there as you're waiting for it to ""disappear"" but you can still collect the items if you managed to do what I mentioned earlier, though sometimes you may not. How this made it past into production is kinda puzzling to me, as this is pretty common occurrence, although replication may be a bit tricky. That said, there's both the issue and workaround.\n\nA second fairly common bug is that depending on certain actions performed before entering water, such as sliding, you are then unable to do any actions in the water. Currently, the only work around would be to do something that changes your action state, like getting hit, or changing your shards/weapons. Alternatively, you can also use the wayward stone to warp back to town, if you have one handy that is.\n\nA third bug is that the game can crash if you are collecting a shard while interacting with a bookcase. It's fairly consistent, and alarming.\n\nOther bugs, which have been resolved, or I only hit once were the issues of missing Miriam's head, which then locks the game in menu, and you cannot do anything but force quit, however that may have had to do with the beta save files.\n\nI do hope these already reported, or is known and just is a patch away. With how common some of these are, and some of them being pretty serious, I'm surprised they got through QA, though there could have been some reasons as to why the fix is delayed. Just hopefully they'll get fixed in the upcoming content patch.\n\n[h1]Music[/h1]\nAs composed by Michiru Yamane, you can definitely hear a lot of the similar choruses and melodies of the influencing series. However, since this is not Castlevania, she obviously had to make sure the tracks aren't using the same songs, and thus come up with some more original tracks. Some of the tracks you can tell are very reminiscent of certain melodies and areas. Admittedly, they are not as memorable to me, but perhaps that's more of a case of it being new, and also the case of having to be original.\n\n[h1]Art/Design[/h1]\nFigured I'd expand a bit more on the art and design of the game. For the most part, it's very good. They've done a decent job to make the areas look unique, interesting and enjoyable to explore.\n\nThe characters are pretty interesting, though I must say that they still seem very ""stiff"", such as Johannes, as well as looking kinda cartoonish. My main gripe for his design is his feet (they're like clown shoes). For Miriam, my gripe would be how her scarf doesn't really flow and flutter as I would expect, and in many cases, just clips down into her, which kinda defeats the point of the fancy design options for the types of scarves you can collect (why didn't they have the physics collision enabled, like they had with the hair?). I would surmise that since this is a 3D modeled game, and this is the first time for the studio involved, perhaps things will look stiff and rough. Hopefully in their next project, they'll improve and things will look better and or more consistent.\n\nThe enemies are pretty numerous, though there are obvious palette swap iterations, which is a common thing for games like this. Some might argue that the AI is buggy still, and maybe, but so far I haven't noticed anything completely off or weird compared to other games like this.\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nAll in all, I would say this is a rather good entry, and considering this is the first game outside of Konami, I'm hopeful Koji Igarashi will be able to make another, either this as it's own franchise, or possible return to help out with the Castlevania series, as he's alluded to being open to the possibility. I would recommend this it anyone that is a fan of the series or of the genre. It's definitely worth the current price, and will be a steal on any sales that may come.",Recommended

Also there's a boss that steals your gold for health, and the cap on him is a little ridiculous when you are in NG+. The grind can feel a little boring at times too.  And once in a while I run into some frame rate drops. But all of that is overall pretty small compared to how great this game is.

"[b]This is one of the first Side-Scroller games I've ever played[/b] and i gotta say, this game is a LOT of fun! For newer players to this genre, Bloodstained can be a bit difficult but once you start getting the hang of it and start crafting more powerful gear and armor you'll be able to breeze through enemies... at least on Normal mode. \n\nBloodstained offers a variety of weapons, unique gear, shard casts (think of it like spells) and moderate character customization. Each level is unique in layouts but with the same idea, slay the Demons, collect their shards/loot drops. You have different shard types and abilities, all unique. They either assist you in combat, protect/shield you or cause damage to enemies. You can also enhance your shards to make them last longer and or more powerful. Gear can provide stat boosts and each Sword, Blade, Knife has differences in damage/speed and some have unique boosts/abilities. There's also cooking which can give you additional stat boosts. Bosses at first can be overwhelming but once you learn how to dodge their attacks and do the most damage, you'll get through them fairly quick. Demons are all completely different and unique in their abilities and attacks. Some can be annoying and others can be frustrating. Oh and i forgot to mention.... [b]There's also Demon Cats[/b].....[b] An Instant 10/10 right there![/b] \n\nAll in all, i didn't expect to be this glued to Bloodstained especially since i haven't really touched this genre before.

Is slaying demons and learning about a fun and interesting world that's on the brink of all out demonic invasion that only you can stop something you're all about?\n\nThen this is the game for you~\n\nFor the TL:DR \nPros: Great Soundtrack, Solid Controls, Stellar Graphics, and some Character Customization options.\nCons: Can get grindy if you're trying to complete the item list, shard list, and recipes for items and food as the shop doesn't carry items that drop from monsters (I'm going to test to see if selling a monster drop item adds it to the shop inventory) and some of the new areas you head into in the late game have very steep scaling.\nVerdict: Get it if you like metroidvania games because this is a wonderful game that will give you more than a few hours of fun.\n\nFor my actual review?\nFirstly I backed this project since its time on Kickstarter so I'm likely a little biased but I'll be as fair and impartial as I can.\n\nUpon first starting the game the audio was a bit loud but easily fixed and the start screen and music set the tone before you even get your first glimpse of the game play and mechanics. Miriam is fairly no nonsense and makes quick note of her own shortcomings and reliance on others aid before she immediately sets off to start stabbing, slashing, clubbing, kicking, and whipping the denizens of hell right back from whence they came (I recommend going with the boots because even with lower damage numbers the boots spam out damage ludicrously quickly) and once you finish the first boss battle you realize that you haven't even made it into the castle.\n\nThe town can cause a lot of downtime because the unique cooking, crafting, and quest mechanics added to the game are rewarding if a bit time consuming (Kill quests am I right?) but even these are fairly benign as you're likely going to kill hundreds of demons on your quest to figure out where to go, what to do, and how to get those items to make your boots of ass kicking even better boots of ass kicking so the occasional rewards from the side quests are a nice diversion. Until you get to the old lady that wants you to bring her food... ugh... She's the most frustrating Quest line because some of the recipes she wants you to bring her are VERY time intensive to farm materials for. \n\nIf it weren't for some of the mechanical changes and the map being smaller than SotN I'd have no complaints about how grand everything feels but the 17 hours I've put in I've seen most of the map and to be fair I put in HUNDREDS of hours in SotN just to find those last tenths of a percent for map completion so it does feel a little condensed. That complaint aside? What there is is GORGEOUS! The rooms are wonderfully detailed, atmospheric, and in conjunction with the soundtrack makes each locale feel unique and impart a unique feeling with every new discovery. The calm music of the forbidden waterway to the frantic metal of inferno cave are well paired and makes each red door you find a treat to find out what's beyond.\n\nAs of writing this I've only reached one of the endings but I must stress that you should take the time to find everything you can because if you reach the first ending and walk away you're missing roughly half of the game and multiple other outcomes.\n\nIf you've managed to get to the end of my fangasming over this Kickstarter dream com Recommended? Congrats, get this game, and good luck on your quest to discover the truth that kicking demons in the face can be as cathartic as it is exhilarating.",Recommended

"[i]Disclaimer: I backed this game at the Alchemist's Treasure tier. You're welcome to speculate if this affects my opinion of the game, it doesn't.[/i]\n\n[H1]The Castlevania Konami refused to give us. The Castlevania we deserved[/H1]\n\nI'm about half way through my *first run* and my appreciation for this game just keeps climbing. That is not to say it's 100% bug free (I've had a couple of cases of being caught ""between rooms"" and needed to wiggle Miriam about for it to work out which room to render) or without the odd rough edge here and there (the animations are what they are, in some cases they're a little janky) but...\n\nI don't [i]care[/i]. I can forgive a little lack of polish. I can forgive a little tiny bit of jank. Because this is Castlevania. It's Castlevania in everything but name. It's got everything you could possibly want, a massive map packed so full of secrets that it's literally Turtles all the way down, it's got so many easter eggs and witty little nods that there's going to be at least one joke [i]per hour[/i] that'll land with you. If you're into your nerd culture, the jokes will probably range from ""Hrr"" all the way up to full on belly laughs. Finding my first literal *bit coin* made me grin, I'm not prone to happy expressions when I'm trying to pull a game apart.\n\n[H1]This game set out to do one thing. Be the next Castlevania. It achieved that goal with surgical precision[/H1]\n\nThis is dyed in the wool Castlevania mechanics, side on, pseudo-2D in this case (it plays with the camera on occasion in some neat ways) with a modern coat of paint and a very well thought out art style (the two protagonists are gonna get Cosplayed something fierce), the music is something else, and if you buy the game and unlike me, are not getting a physical copy of the sound track, buy the damn thing on Steam. This is one for your collection. \n\nYou, starting off as Miriam, you get to unlock the second Protagonist later on, work your way through a -massive- set of areas in a super metroid style of unlocking bits of territory by gaining new skills and tools, most of which will serve multiple functions and help you in different ways.\n\nYou'll get access to a vast array of weaponry, swords, daggers, and maces are for those who like their combat in the missionary position. For those who like their combat kinky, feel free to explore the wide selection of boots, whips, rapiers, greatswords, and guns (with multiple ammo types). There will be a style that you gravitate to, and within each category there's enough variation that you won't get bored any time soon. That's not even counting comedy options like Toy Boots which as well as being a weapon, will squeak as you run, like, squeaky toy squeak.\n\nThen there's the ridiculous number of equipment options (armour sadly is not updated on the model, but helms, accessories and scarves *are*) along with a customisation suite that's remarkably fleshed out, allowing you to make Miriam very much your own hero as you delve deeper.\n\n... and then there's the shard system, which is absurdly deep, along with familiars, the book system. A cooking system which makes Cook Serve Delicious go ""Waaaait a second, are you sure you're not trying to take my job?"" and a crafting system which means you'll be kept busy farming for those sweet sweet bits of loot that let you smash past the next boss.\n\n[H1]IGA's playing the best of Castlevania's past and present, and boy does it sound good[/H1]\n\nThe controls are tight, there's no jank in the movement, jumping is precise, combat is exactly where it needs to be for Castlevania, the enemies are varied and come with plenty of ways to keep you on your toes, bosses are tough enough that if you're not prepared they'll send you packing, but if you _are_ ready for them, with a bit of practice they fall over nicely. The difficulty at normal is pitched just about right for new entrants and people with a bit of rust, for experts though I suspect they'll blast through Normal quickly (or even skip it, see commenters below) and then ramp up to Hard for their next run.\n\nFor people who want to take things slow and farm for shards and see everything that is available, the game will let you take your time and won't force you scurrying towards any particular boss, just enjoy the ride, and most definitely stop to enjoy the level design. This is one you won't want to miss.\n\nTo Koji Igarashi, I only have two words - Thank you.\n\nTo everyone else...\n\nVerdict: [b]Essential[/b]",Recommended

The Inferno Cave theme was about the only one I can stand back and call great\nI'd say this might be the best Igavania and at worst I think most would agree this secures a spot in the big 3 next to Symphony of the Night and Aria of Sorrow\nVery excited for whats to come from the (free) DLCs and possibly mods",Recommended
"So far i was steadily following the Kickstarter updates throughout the years, the same developer who made Symphony of the Night also made the new series of Bloodstained.\n\nI was really interested on seeing how its project was going, since 2015 when its kickstarter was started it reached over 5.5 millions on funding (in quite REAL SHORT TIME) and i was interested on seeing how Igarashi could do a masterpiece without the chains that Konami had on the project development.\n\nThose damn leashes on him surely ailed his main goal for years and now we see it on Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night.\n\nThe gameplay is a mix between SotN/DoS/OoE which to see the new elements, weapons, accesories, magic, are quite new and i can see it was clearly a challenge to develop and have new ideas on it.\n\nNow im starting to think AAA are fucking up gaming with their shitty standards and short time given on games, this is the living proof it REALLY takes time to make a good game with innovative elements, altough i see the current price on the IGA back pack im kinda jealous now that i didnt backed the game on time...\n\nMistakes were made but oh well...\n\nComing to rating the game:\nVisual: 10/10\nStory: 7.5/10 (its kinda weird the story at this point, lets see how he develops the next chapter on bloodstained)\nGameplay: 9.5/10 (some combos get mixed up so its ugh...)\nMusic: 11/10\nVariety: 10/10\nReplayability: Quite replayable\nDifficulty: Easy to learn / hard to master (3 choices on difficulty normal, hard, Nightmare)\n\nNow we gotta wait for the free DLCs to put on the alternate costumes on Miriam (i hope there are more than 2 coming) as well the other bonus modes.

Scratches that Castlevania itch real good.,Recommended
"Ideally, I wouldn't recommend anything at all and just put my thoughts here, but ultimately ""not recommending"" it comes closest to my feelings toward with the game, as disappointing as that may be. Like, the basic loop of exploring and killing mobs is pretty fun, but I've not played many games with such high highs and such low lows as Bloodstained. Looking back at it with the knowledge I have now, I would've rather spent my time playing something else, but that is not necessarily Recommended for everyone. A lot of people seem to enjoy this, so that may well be you. So here are my major issues with the game. All the good stuff you probably know. You smack around monsters, you jump, you hit walls, that sort of thing. Wholesome fun!\n\nOne of the most basic and surface level things about Bloodstained RotN is that it doesn't have as much character as Symphony of the Night and the gameplay isn't as tight either. Now, it may be unfair to compare this game to SotN, a game that many consider a classic, but, believe me, this game truly invites the comparisons. \n\nA few years ago, I played SotN for the first time. Despite being pretty dated and kinda bloated with mechanics, it is still better than this -- as much as RotN tries to exploit your nostalgia. Not only does it constantly hit you over the head with references, it just directly copies stuff from previous Castevanias. From enemy types to weapons and even story beats. Sure, it's nice to go down memory lane, but this game takes a little too much. There's literally a spike hallway near the bell tower. Like, come on. As a result, it feels like something I've played already but not quite as well made. \n\nLike I said, the lack of focus that marred SotN is in full force here as well. I could deal with it in that game. The superfluous-feeling mechanics were relatively light. Sure, the game wasn't as streamlined as Super Metroid, but it was still great. Here, it's a lot more egregious. The game, the bosses, the enemies are designed around the bloat. With bloat I mean the crazy number of abilities in this game. There are simply too many active and passive abilities for its own good and juggling them is e a pain. The designers must've recognized it and put in a shortcut menu so you can quickly access different builds, but it's a band aid at best. Screens absolutely full of enemies or enemies that do screen-filling AOE attacks necessitate using abilities that feel like you're cheesing the game. On top of that, grinding out shards or materials is just not fun. It's busywork when I'd rather get back to the meat and bones of exploring further. even the quests are a grind. By the end of the game, they have dozens of chests that only contain measly amounts of gold instead of weapons or armor. The items should've been in there, rather than being locked behind grind.\n\nBut more than anything else, I don't understand why they decided to double down on the amount of time you have to spend in menus rather than streamlining this. It's a choice, I guess, but not one I agree with. Imagine that all those traversal abilities in SotN like mist, bat, bat echo, and the dog were all mapped to the same button and you had to equip them every time you needed to use them for something minor -- oh, and the same button is shared by the blood sucking ability and all your other active skills. Like, what were they thinking? I can't agree with that choice. The water section is the absolute worst with this, but the nuisance of equipping different skills to traverse this one little obstacle and then going back to your usual setup is a constant factor.\n\nThe entire water section is test of patience. There are no redeeming qualities. I don't think even people who really like Bloodstained can disagree here. It should not have been designed the way it is. Moving around in the water does not feel good. The designers must've played the OG Ocarina of Time and loved the heck out of the Water Temple, because boy do you spent a lot of time equipping and unequipping abilities in the water area. \n\nOverall, the map is not nearly as compelling as Symphony. Not just the layout but In terms of cohesion as well. The areas feel like completely different levels in a game rather than something that's supposed to be located in or around a castle. It doesn't really make sense how all these distinct areas are tied together. Maybe there's some deep lore that justifies it, but in gameplay it feels disjointed, it doesn't have a distinct sense of place. In addition to that, some areas look really good (graphically) while others either look bad or are incredibly dull. In terms of exploration, some of the later areas are truly a pain to go through. I hope you liked SotN's flea men, frogs and bats, because this game is packed with them. Packed. \n\nAnother interesting point of comparison: Bloostained Curse of the Moon. That had really fun those boss fights. I had the polar opposite experience with RotN. Mostly not fun. They've got too much health, ridiculous abilities that take off half your health bar and are super difficult to read, just generally a RNG fest when it comes to patterns. I don't know if it's better on normal, but on hard the boss fights just actively suck the fun out of the game. I dreaded each one after a while. Some of the extra abilities they get are nuts. Literally 100% to 0% stun lock combos. Challenging in none of the right ways.\n\nOn the subject of sound and music, it's cool that they got the Castlevania composer back on board, but the soundtrack is barely there. It does not have the presence of what you'd think of as a Castlevania soundtrack. Very muted, not at all ripping, strangely mixed. Again, very little character to it. The sound design in general is not fantastic. There are no soul-piercing howls like when you kill a zombie in Symphony, no satisfying sound effects as an enemy explodes into flames. Nothing really stands out. Enemies whimper out of existence.\n\nMy personal enjoyment sank low enough that I wouldn't recommend the game. Again, perhaps it's just the hard mode that's such a pain in the butt. Normal difficulty was too easy, hard mode has too much BS. Ultimately, I would not have even started playing the game if I knew what awaited me. I'd rather have played something else. It's an okay game and a lot of people will love, love, love this. But I cannot get behind a lot of the design choices this game made -- especially when there are many other great games in this genre already on Steam that I think come with less caveats (e.g. Hollow Knight, Elliot Quest, Ori and the Blind Forest). If you've played all of those already, give it a shot -- especially if you liked the GBA Castlevanias, I think. Or play it if you're not too susceptible to the things I described above. It's totally fine in that case. Maybe it's this crazy heatwave that's getting to me. I probably should not be sitting next a PC that's running pretty hot.",Not Recommended
"Kick Starter Success, after a number of delays. And full disclosure, I did back this and I am a massive Castlevania fan, so I'm probably more than a little bias in this review.\n\nBloodstained: Ritual of the Night, is everything you want from a Castlevania game. Exploration, cool art style, secrets and fantastic music. Is it flawless? Absolutely not. But it's a fantastic game that is addicting, like all Metroidvania style games, be them the Metroid Series, Castlevania or many indie games that emulate them.\n\nStory: You play as Miriam, a Shardbinder created against their will by the Alchemist Guild after they started losing power in the Industrial Revolution. Ten years ago, your creators screwed the world by summoning the Legions of Hell to Earth, but they were defeated. Fast toward to today, and the Shardbinder Gebel, your old friend, has revived the Demon's Castle to remake the world after seeing the evils of mankind. Now the last Shardbinder must defeat the Demon's Castle.\n\nIt's a serviceable plot with some very likable characters, such as Miriam herself and the Demon Slayer Zangetsu (voiced by Solid Snake himself). The game is relatively light on story for 60%, as it's usually only brought up after beating a boss or at the start/end of the game, not bogging down the gameplay with cutscenes. \n\nThe only criticisms of it are spoilers, so I won't elaborate, but if you've played a Castlevania, you'll predict how to unlock the Good Ending. In addition, the final plot point feels slightly forced to me and lacking the kick similar points in the past have provided.\n\n\nGraphics: Colorful, stylish. The game is 2.5D, and uses it very well in a certain boss fight. Lovely colors, very few technical glitches (although I did lose Miriam's head for some reason and the game crashed because of it). However, the 2.5D perspective can sometimes cause you to undershoot platforms.\n\n\nSound: Very good. Very Castlevania. The voice acting is another thing to touch on. It's fantastic. The actors do a great job in this game, especially David Hayter in portraying the anger and weariness of Zangetsu. The music is fitting and there are a number of pieces from Curse of the Moon in here too.\n\n\nGameplay: The Gameplay is simple: you enter the Demon's Castle with minimal weapons, Shards (your magical abilities you obtain from Demons) and abilities. You head through the map, killing bosses and enemies to acquire powerups such as Double Jump, in order to proceed further into the Castle. You are rewarded for keeping a paranoid mindset, as normal looking walls could contain a secret with a Health Max increase or an ingredient for food/weapon crafting.\n\nAh yes, I should mention that. The game has a crafting system, where you take raw materials to either make weapons, cook food or increase the power of your Shards. Food is a healing item that, when eaten for the first time, will give a flat stat increase from then on. This system is where the chunk of your stats will come from. If you're under leveled but have good food stats, you can overcome low levels.\n\nThe variety of weapons is amazing. Spears, Katana, Great Swords, THE WHIP, and guns, are but a few types in this game. Each weapon type has it's own moveset and special moves to unlock. You'll probably end up being like me in most Castlevanias and just equip a Whip even though it's trash tier until you get the stronger ones. \n\nHowever, in gameplay, I have to talk about a topic I get a bit hot under the collar about: Difficulty. If I hear one more person say ""Symphony of the Night was Harder and had more Mechanics"", BULL. It did not. SotN was easy and so were it's bosses. This game is on the easy side, like many of it's predecessors. I didn't die much in it...except for the optional bosses and the final three bosses. The game is forgiving and with Health Potions, spammable magic abilities and certain abilities, you can break most bosses easily.\n\nYet, if you're wanting a harder game from the start, change your savefile name upon game start to ""NIGHTMARE"" and it'll set the difficulty to Nightmare mode, which is far harder.\n\n\nFinal Verdict: The game is easy, yes, and while visually stunning, I did randomly get framedrops. Not consistently but they were there. Except some minor issues with the story and difficulty, the game is worth picking up and supporting. If you like Castlevania, then grab it. Like Metroid? Grab it. If you wanna spit on Konami's Corporate Greed? Grab it. If you grab it on a Sale and love it, grab the IGA Back Pack, as it's just giving you access to the content the Backers get for free for backing the project for the same price. \n\nFinally, the developers listen. They redid portions of the game just because in the Demos, fans and players HATED it so much. They take criticism well and put the gamer first. \n\n9/10. Too many small issues to give Perfect 10/10.",Recommended

Igarashi).\n\nGraphics are definately a category that divides all of the players. Personally i didn't mind since i understand the monumental effort the team would need to undertake. though i did notice : texture clipping, textures not covering up the void ( under the bridge rocks ), textures being in the wrong place in the foreground.\n\nby no means can someone say that this is horrible, but it does look rough in places.\n\nSince there is no way to ""paint"" the map i needed to take a picture and paint where i've been with each progression skill (much like Portrait of ruin, Dawn of sorrow, order of Ecclesia).\n\n1. major gripe is the use of Motions for the special moves, as a person who is laughably bad in fighting games doing quarter circle attack is a challenge onto itself. could have been alleviated with a augment button ( ex. LB + attack )\n2. another gripe is with the mobility shards themselves. as a person who relied heavily on offensive shards having to switch ever so often is annoying. they should have had their own category. i found myself breaking my pace by having to switch builds ( with the shortcut system ).\n3. Lastly, after a point it gets hard to tell what you need to do / where to go.\nfor example there is a room in the cathedral where the only way to progress is to take huge chunks of damage while trying to cast a directional shard.

"This is a terrific throwback to Castlevania which longtime fans of the series are bound to enjoy. There is no marked departure from the DS games in terms of game mechanics, which as I have noticed seems to have rubbed some series aficionados the wrong way, but bear in mind that this is a Kickstarter game and that it was pitched to backers from a nostalgia-laden angle. The developers played it safe and the final product is an absolute delight nevertheless. My biggest gripe is that the castle could have been fleshed out some more but as someone who may have been spoiled by timeless classics such as Baldur's Gate and other RPGs that keep you busy for well over a hundred hours per run I may be too harsh on Bloodstained. If you are still on the fence about it, the developers will be squeezing out free post-launch content over the next few months (I suppose) so that should help shore up the core experience and strengthen its replay value. All told, I can hardly get enough of the world Iga and Co. have created for us so I am holding my breath for more story-related content and expansions in the foreseeable future.",Recommended

You can have 5 different abilities equipped at any time for each different category of abilities. \n\nThe combat is solid. There are a few parts of the game that do feel a bit janky. There are bugs, some of which may be game breaking. Unfortunately I have hit a few of them, but I didn't hit enough for it to ruin my enjoyment.

"Everything it needed to be, with some decent quality of life improvements over the original formula.\n\nIf you're into any of the Metroidvania style Castlevania games, you're going to love love LOVE this. It plays exactly how you expect it to, so you know what you're getting into already. It's definitely worth full price.\n\nIf I had any complaints, it'd be\n\n- The game is not well optimized for PCs. It'll run, but if you're not satisfied with the default options, then you may have problems. The game does seem a little blurry and washed out unless you go into a config file and add a couple lines. (Go to pcgamingwiki for this information)\n\n- There's a glitch that happens when you backdash/slide off a surface. It eats your jump. This isn't a problem late game, but when you enter a water area for the first time, be wary. If you slide/backdash off a ledge into water, you're stuck. \n\n- Dismantling things is pretty necessary if you want to 100% the game, and it is a hassle. It gets expensive with the item you need, and it's only mitigated when you can farm them late game. Making it pretty much pointless to use until then. I don't mind the farming, since it can go by pretty fast with the right equipment, but that isn't an excuse. I shouldn't have to gather stacks of 99 alkahest just to be able to dismantle the stacks of 9 weapons I farmed just to get two materials I need. Alkahest needs to either get a crafting recipe, become cheaper, or make it an item that pops up in the silver chests.\n\nI could probably come up with more, but I'd say these are the most important. You can safely ignore these nitpicks and enjoy the game all the way through. Potential GOTY, I hope there's DLC. Well done Iga, you proved us wrong. :)",Recommended
"This might be the best ""IGAvania"" game to date, which is a high bar. It's certainly the deepest one, with countless systems to optionally grind for (and amazingly, they never feel overwhelming, since they're contextualized with easy-to-grasp concepts like borrowing books from a library or cooking food.)\n\nThe gameplay is a progression from the ""Sorrow"" series, with each of the nearly 100 enemy types being able to drop a magic ability, and the firearms from those games have returned but with much, much more effort put into them to make them a viable alternate weapon type. The biggest addition to combat is techniques, which are Street Fighter-esque special moves that appear on various weapons, and if you hit enough enemies with them you ""master"" them, which transfers that technique to all weapons of the same class. Katanas have SIX techniques, so weaving in all these special moves skillfully into battles is great fun and highly rewarding. The music is up to the high standards of SOTN's soundtrack. No complaints there, and it has some real standout tracks.\n\nThe only real problem with the game is a very bumpy difficulty curve (some bosses will die in seconds, others will mercilessly kick your ass,) a lack of polish with the cutscenes (editing and directing especially,) and there's some very unintuitive moments required to progress. The method of getting the Recommended ending is something I never could have discovered without googling since it required me to do less damage to a boss, which is hopefully something they're planning on fixing since it seems unintentional.\n\nI played through it pretty much nonstop, and when I wasn't playing it, I was thinking about it. If you're even vaguely interested in the genre of action RPGs or metroidvanias, this is the new gold standard, so do yourself a favor and pick it up.",Recommended

"It's very good. Not perfect, there are glitches, some crashes - be sure to save at every opportunity, never lost more than 20 minutes (and that only once) because there are a lot of checkpoints, but still - and such things.\n\nBut it's good. There's a lot of stuff to do, the castle is fun to explore, and it's overall well put together with a lot of though put into (most) of the game.\n\nI'd have to say the biggest thing the game does wrong is it is too easy, haven't actually died once - or even come close, honestly. Although I've heard the higher difficulties are more of a challenge - FYI, there's a password you can put in (look it up) to unlock those higher difficulties from the start. Wish I knew, but if that's you're kinda thing, maybe it will be helpful information.\n\n8.5/10 Right now, likely to raise higher as the rest of the game's stretch goals filter in - half the reason I funded this game was to get a Metroidvania to play with my brother, after all.\n\nSorry about the lack of detail, I can only really manage to get worked up and talk at length and detail about things I dislike, and there just isn't a whole lot of that here.",Recommended
"Great Game , Good job Koji",Recommended
"[h1]Prologue: disclaimer[/h1]\nI've been a fan of the Castlevania series since #1 on the NES. The series however has fared badly under the mismanagement of Konami's pachinko-delusions. Koji Igarashi split with them a few years ago and promised a spiritual successor to the great (metroidvania) games and Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night (and its companion game: Bloodstained: Curse of the Moon which is more akin to the linear games). Iga-san has delivered, in short.\n\n[h1]Feast of recognition[/h1]\nIf you have played any Castlevania game that Iga had a hand in, you will find familiar elements: great music, beautiful scenery, varied enemies (with some redeco variants), tight controls and a boatload of fan-centered references and easter eggs. The attention to detail is phenomenal and you'll be having a laugh at the many fun surprises that await. Yes, familiar voice-actors are included, yes there are hidden areas and bosses, yes you get to spend more time collecting shards and items than you'd do collecting ALL Pokémon... And you'll love it.\n\n[h1]On its own?[/h1]\nDon't get me wrong here, but this is a question many non-CV fan gamers may have: Is Bloodstained a good game in its own right? Or is it just fanservice for the Iga-nuts? Frankly, the answer is a resounding YES! Even if you wouldn't know Castlevania from a rubber ducky and have never played one of the older games, Bloodstained is a phenomenal game.\n\n[h1]Nag, nag, nag[/h1]\nIf I am to level any complaints though... Presuming you have played Curse of the Moon, you'll recognise the bosses from that game. Plenty of other ones, but... they're all in here too. And [spoiler]Glutton Train[/spoiler] looked a lot better in 8-bit style. Less weird pulsing/liquidized effects. Later game features some dunno where to go moments and [spoiler]Den of Behemoth big enemies need to drop a shard for the entry, without these being an actual new shard. And demon #44 is not fun to farm for his shard either[/spoiler].\n\n[h1]Final verdict[/h1]\nI'd say this game is worth getting. At [u]full[/u] price no less with the dlc. Just be mindful that in terms of difficulty it can be as hard (or harder) as Order of Ecclesia.",Recommended

"I'm conflicted about this game.\n\nFirst of all, I bought this game thinking that I would be able to play as Zangetsu - a manly man. He is advertized as a second playable character, but apparently he's not implemented yet. Instead he will be released as a free DLC later. ...which makes buying and playing the game NOW pointless, since I'm not interested in rebeating the game again.\n\nSecond of all, there's the horrible, horrible grinding: Hours and hours of entering a screen, killing one monster, being disappointed when the ingredient or shard I need didn't drop, exiting the screen, and then entering the screen again for another go. That's what half of Bloodstained is about, if you want to do the horribly repetitive side quests. There's a counter keeping track of how many monsters you've killed, and I think mine is something like over 7100 monsters. Are you honestly looking forward to killing 7100 monsters, which is roughly about 70 monsters of each type? It's not technically REQUIRED of you to do that, but you want to get the quest rewards, don't you? There's an NPC that will ONLY hand out ""Grind this monster."" quests, another that will have you grind for food ingredients, and another that will have you grind for other ingredients, and then there's the technique mastering ""quests"" that doesn't even give you so much as an achievement, and there's no other side quests at all. No, there's actually ONE non-grind quest - how could I forget.\n\nThird of all there's the bugs and the crashes. I've suffered some, but thankfully key items didn't disappear for me, and I was able to finish the game. Others were not that lucky, and had to restart their playthrough from the beginning. You might want to delay buying the game until those are fixed.\n\nNow for the good parts: The graphics are good (for a Castlevania game), the music is good, and there's no lack of content. When I didn't have to grind for ingredients, I loved the transmuting and cooking system. It's just that the drops are far too rare.\n\nI wish there was a middle option for voting, but if I am to decide, the obnoxious grinding ultimately soured me. I don't want to see another flying golden cow, or another Ocypete bird for as long as I live.",Not Recommended

"A worthy modern Castlevania. My biggest gripe is the need for balance patches. There are some shards that vastly overshadow the rest of them, to the point there really isn't much choice if you want to play optimally. Another major balance change needed is disabling invert for all the optional bosses. None of them care to attack you when you're on the ceiling, and it makes all of them very easy to beat.\n\nCurrently about a 12 hour experience to beat it, but I spent closer to 35 100%'ing it on normal. I plan to revisit harder difficulties after balance patches, assuming we get them.

GOTY for me\n\nEverything good about Castlevania franchise here. This game is the combination of Symphony of the Night, Aria of Sorrow, and NDS Castlevania games at its finest. If you played any of them in the past, you'll realize this game implemented only good things from them and made it work very smoothly. It's basically all Castlevania games combined together, even story and characters, but done perfectly. The only difference is the name. It does require a lot of grinding for those who run 100% on everything, especially when it comes to perfecting your items and shards, but besides that, I really see no problem in this game. The old lady giving you quests for all those different foods is pretty annoying, but completing all of them will repay you with a super crazy and op item that makes all the effort worth it.\n\nWhat's even more exciting is there're 13 FREE DLCs coming. I completed 100% map, quests, and ultimate build for Miriam, but it's still not over. I might have to downgrade her a bit since her build is way too op at this point, but it's still very exciting to see what's coming next.\n\nIf you are more of a retro Castlevania fan like from Simon Belmont to Richter from Rondo of Blood, they already released the game for you last year: Curse of the Moon. It's also another great game for Castlevania fans, especially old school fans, so no worries.\n\nTo put it short, this is the 2019 Game of the Year for me. My only regret is by the time I first found out about this game, Kickstarter backing was already over.",Recommended
Exactly what we all wanted this game to be.,Recommended
"Okay, after 100%ing Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night, and spending a couple days (yeah I'm fast) thinking it over, I think I'm ready to write out my thoughts on this.\n\nWith Bloodstained, the summary of this review is: it was worth the wait.\n\nIt's a metroidvania (some people are saying 'Igavania' now but whatever). You play Miriam, a cute girl on her first canonical adventure! Through exploring the world (mostly a big castle), you'll find monsters who drop ingredients. You can find other ingredients around the castle, in chests or sometimes in walls. You can talk to a farmer at the home village who'll grow crops for you if you provide him with seeds!\n\nOnce you've got the ingredients, you can start cooking. Miriam starts off as a pretty terrible cook, but as you progress through the castle you'll occasionally come across cookbooks which will teach Miriam new recipes, allowing you to cook more interesting and innovative food items. These can range from rice dishes to creative meaty hot pots to a nice hunk of juicy prime steak. Cooking food is one way to make money, but it's also necessary to complete specific requests made of you - and each time you eat a specific meal for the first time, you gain some permanent bonuses. Cooking has never been so much fun!\n\nOh, yeah, and there's something about saving the world, a fistful of cool weapons (I loved the guns the most), tons of awesome spells you can steal from enemies, interesting pieces of gear, trinkets, cosmetics... and all designed by the metroidvania master himself, Koji Igarashi.\n\nThis time around they don't really hide from you any of the 'cool moves' your swords and stuff can do. You can find books which clue you in on the exact motion on the d-pad you gotta do to get a thing out of your weapon. So if you input 236 on the d-pad and attack, your sword might throw a fireball or whatever. In other games, you'd have to buy a book or whatever that maybe tells you the specific move for a specific weapon or just guess it, and in some instances guessing it was all you had. Bloodstained has all (or most of at least) the techniques Miriam can learn and use on bookshelves scattered around the world, and you can still just guess moves if you think your weapon has something cool to play with.\n\nThe areas are all 'cool I guess'. Most are pretty much what you expect from 'the castle' but there are a few that at least stand out quite well visually. Traversing them is at least pretty fun, but I noticed the removed the thing where you jump backwards on receiving damage which I think impacted the level design somewhat... on the plus side, no more annoying enemies waiting for the on the other side of a gap! On the other hand, well, things are a bit more dull. It reminds me of Symphony of the Night where you walk into a room and there's basically just a bunch of guys standing around, basically waiting for you to show up. Not really a problem, but very typical of this kind of game.\n\nActually getting around the world is at least plenty of fun, and as your options open up you get that wonderful feeling of growing more and more in power until honestly you're trivialising everything. Some people aren't into that, I think it's fine, after a certain point you will completely outlevel everything and no matter what gear you use you'll obliterate anyone you fight in a few hits. I kinda like that.\n\nThis is maybe the first game in a while that's drawn me in so completely. I kind of was hesitant while downloading, thinking, ""oh gee I loved Curse of the Moon because it was a classic style game, this is one of those metroidvanias"" but I ended up loving it.\n\nBloodstained: Ritual of the Night will probably be my 'Game of the Year' (for whatever that's worth).",Recommended
"Okay, so let me open this by saying I have never played a 2D Castlevania before and I've barely even played one of the 3D ones. Still, I ended up buying this one because I saw the passion of the developers and all the positive reviews and pretty much all my friends played it and said it was good, so I figured I'd give it a shot.\n\nI ended up enjoying it much more than I anticipated, despite not having any sort of nostalgia to work off of. It simply is a really good game in its own rights.\n\nFor me, it tackles the same itch Dark Souls does. Not necessarily in difficulty (although Bloodstained is more difficult than most modern games) but in the methodical combat and the careful exploration.\n\nIt softlocked once so far, but otherwise, it's been running flawlessly.\n\nNot poop out of 10.",Recommended

"[h1]A Slavish Homage to a Classic[/h1]\n\nKoji Igarashi made a promise years ago to deliver a new game that Konami thought fans no longer wanted of their own Castlevania franchise. Now, halfway through 2019, he has successfully delivered on that promise, and I'm delighted to say it was worth the wait.\n\n[b][u]Tried and Recommended Gameplay[/u][/b]\n\nIf you've played almost any post-Symphony of the Night 2D Castlevania game, you'll be intimately familiar with the mechanics at play in this game. Despite its many resemblances to Symphony of the Night itself, the gameplay is more akin to the handheld titles such as Aria of Sorrow. Your character will level up as you defeat enemies with a variety of attack methods at your disposal, starting with the most basic in the form of your weapon. Weapons come in a variety of shapes and sizes, from straight swords to boots, or greatswords to whips. Each weapon type has a different speed and attack shape that lends to a distinct feel, and you'll likely find the type(s) that suit you the best rather quickly. Certain weapons of each type also have 'techniques' that can be executed with fighting-game style inputs, and if performed often enough, will be unlocked for all weapons of that category. An example would be a katana having a move to deflect incoming melee attacks with a parry; if you execute the parry often enough, all katana weapons from then onward can execute the same move.\n\nYour other methods of attack come from spells, known in this game as 'Shards'. Almost every enemy in the game has a small chance to bestow its 'Shard' upon you, and they come in 6 flavors: Conjure, Effective, Directional, Enchant, Familiar and Skill shards.\n\n[list]\n[*]Conjure - These shards are a simple button press and have various effects, from launching a projectile in front of you to summoning pillars of flames.\n[*]Effective - These shards have you hold/toggle a button to provide various effects such as a dash forward or the ability to pick up objects in the environment. These are extremely varied in their functionality.\n[*]Directional - These see you holding your character's arm out in a direction with the right stick and pressing a button to activate a directional attack, such as launching a fireball or sending a spiraling skewer outward. There are some utility shards as well for this.\n[*]Enchant - These are passive shards. Having one equipped will bestow its effect until you unequip it. These can be upgraded to max rank to become a Skill shard.\n[*]Familiar - These shards allow you to summon a creature to follow you and attack enemies alongside you. These shards can level up independently of your character level as you play with them following you.\n[*]Skill - These shards are mostly utility and part of the game progression, though Enchant shards can be upgraded to become Skill shards. Skill shards are always active unless manually toggled off.\n[/list]\n\n[b][u]A Bit of a Grind[/u][/b]\n\nGetting the shards is a bit of luck, with the default drop rates for most falling at around the 4% mark or lower. This leads to a lot of  grinding if there is a shard you want in particular. The same can be said for item drops, though there are accessories and stats that can alter these numbers more in your favor.\n\nA large portion of the items in the game are only accessible via crafting at the Alchemist, who also allows you to cook dishes that can permanently increase your stats, and the same person who upgrades your shards with various materials you've acquired. Items you don't want to keep can be dismantled for materials if you'd like, or sold at the shop for gold that you can use to buy anything you've previously crafted or consumables like potions.\n\nThis is a mechanic that can be enjoyable if you don't mind grinding for materials, but it's not necessary as treasure and enemy drops will periodically drop weapons and armor for you to use that can hold its own, though it will be more difficult than if you put in the work to get better armor or gear through alchemy.\n\n[b][u]Presentation Isn't Everything[/u][/b]\n\nThough the game came off looking very rough just a year ago, they made a marked effort to improve the game visually. The results of this facelift is a much more pleasant looking game, though one that is still not entirely gorgeous. There are times where the game looks quite nice, but it also has a lot of areas that look rather uninspired, even considering it's being fairly derivative of a past title in the first place.\n\nThe music is actually quite nice, though it never matches the best that Castlevania has had to offer in the past. Voice acting is overall very good, if not hammy, but it's clear this was their intention and not a mistake, as the story itself is quite silly. The game's sound effects are all quite nice, as well, with heavy weapons sounding distinct from light ones, and spells having a good heft when they need it.\n\nThe game is also fairly buggy despite the clear effort they put into polishing the game during its delay, though they're all minor. During my playtime I encountered bugs where enemy item drops would clip into walls and touching them would not grab them, though leaving the area afterwards would then acquire the drop. I also encountered a bug with swimming in which my character could not attack or jump out of the water, effectively soft locking me into having to create a Suspend point save and reload. There were also occasions where the camera would behave strangely or I could control my character for a couple of seconds after death, but none of these bugs made the game less enjoyable.\n\n[h1]Fans of Exploration Focused Castlevania Titles Shouldn't Miss Out on Bloodstained[/h1]",Recommended

"This game is amazing. It honors the legacy of Symphony of the Night (as well as other GBA Castlevania titles), and it surpasses it. I have backed many kickstarter games and they have all been disappointing. However, this title is without question the best game that has come out of Kickstarter. \n\n+ Gameplay: 10/10. This game makes grinding fun.\n\n+ Sound: 9/10. Audio sets up theme perfectly, though some tracks are far more memorable than others.\n\n+ Graphics: 8.5/10. This definitely could be improved, especially during the verbal sequences but during gameplay, it looks amazing.\n\nIf you want to reminisce about the golden age of 2D games, there is simply no better option out there right now.\nNote that this review is prior to any of the DLC content is added. However, even without it I am already more than happy with the title.\n",Recommended

"Oh My God!!!!!!  I played for 35 minutes and had to stop to gush about this game.  This is probably what every fan wants from a castlevania game, even though its NOT castlevania.  Its produced by Koji Igarashi, who produced all the great Castlevania games.  My favorite, Castlevania Symphony of the Night, and a bunch of others.  If you want the best of every castlevania game in one game, look no further.  This game is beautiful!  Everything about this game is a spiritual successor to the castlevania series. Music, playstyle, monsters, everything!   I love the fact they created this game without Konami and Konami will probably be kicking themselves after they see the revenue and fan love this game is getting and will get from new players, who aren't even familiar with the castlevania series.  My hats off to Koji and all the developers and people who came together to make this game.  It is a Masterpiece!  Buy it, if anything I said rings Recommended to you.  Its worth every penny and more!  They are also going to be adding A LOT of extra dlc content, FOR FREE!  Take that EA!  oh, PS, no surprise mechanics in this gem.  lol.

"I'm a backer.  This game is everything that I've wanted and then some.  If you are expecting some earth shattering game that will move the entire industry forward or think Hollow Knight already did what I said, this game is probably not for you.  Or maybe it is, because I would recommend it to you anyway.\n\nIf you liked any of the exploration based Castlevania titles or Metroidvanias as we all liked(or used to like) calling them then play this game.  Buy it immediately.  It takes a lot of the good of Symphony of the Night, the Sorrow Titles, Portrait of Ruin, and even some aspects of Order of Ecclesia.  The soundtrack is divine.  If you played Curse of the Moon at all, you'll be rewarded not just with cameos and returning characters, but with returning songs.  The remixed versions of the songs from that game were my favorite tracks by far.\n\nThe game is probably one of the easier titles Iga has made, but not nearly as pathetic as Aria of Sorrow or Harmony of Dissonance.  Thankfully, the other difficulty modes take care of that.\n\nThe game is ""short"" in that it's a good length for a game of its ilk.  10 hours is more than normal for a first time playthrough, but people like me who get the exploration and collection bug will obviously take a lot longer.  Not to mention that stuff about the ""13 free DLCs"" are all the stretch goals that have yet to be put in the game.  However, the game is complete enough without them.  Think of those free DLCs down the line as a nice bonus.\n\nLook, Konami flat out refused to give IGA a basic budget to make a game for years.  If you ever felt that his previous titles felt cheap and cut too many corners...that's because they were due to the fact that he was forced to.  Then he asked us to help him make this game.  We did just that through kickstarter and what we ended up with was one of the best kickstarter titles ever made.  It stands proudly next to Hollow Knight(Which also got its expansions as Free DLC by the way), A Hat in TIme(similar, but one was paid), Freedom Planet(2 expansions got cancelled), and Shovel Knight to name a few of the more famous games.\n\nBUY IT.",Recommended

"[h1]8/10 - Something Old is New Again [/h1]\nIt is a great mix of the best features of the modern era of Castlevania games. Gameplay wise it is most similar to Dawn of Sorrow & Order of Ecclesia. The gameplay and story start off slow, but within a few hours the plot picks up to it's standard Castlevania pace, and you can tailor your gameplay exactly how you want to play with tons of flexibility in spells and abilities based on ""shards"". It had a few bugs in the early hours, but those seem to be all worked out (benefit of being on Steam). It is better than most Metroidvanias, even if Hollow Knight still wears the crown.

"IF you haven't played Castlevania: Symphony of the Night before, then i have great news. There are now two awesome games i'd like to recommend to you.\n\nIt's Symphony of the night at it's core but bigger and better in almost every way. Lots of monsters lots of rooms lots of strategic turning around and jumping away to the nearest save/warp room. I like almost everything about this game.\n\nHowever it has the same problems SOTN had as well. The menu system is clunky, action is cut frequently by needing to change out shards, testing out new weapons and armor is tedious, there was an attempt at a quick menu but you have to unlock it, and it's weird and i never used it. The soundtrack is nothing to write home about, nothing particularly stood out that didnt immediately remind me of a better symphony of the night song. the visuals range from gorgeous to lol, sometimes in the same shot. \n\nFinally, I don't know how much more or less i would have enjoyed this game if it weren't for the ps1 game. A lot of the problems i found with it i probably wouldn't have noticed if i weren't consistently comparing it to the old game, and i tried not to do it but there are so many glaring similarities between the two (that librarian's voice is prettty deep isnt it?) that it's hard not to do. As it is, i loved the first game and of the 3 days i've had to play it i've put in about 17 adult-with-things-to-do hours in it. \n\nI'm gonna 100% it (or 200% if it's as much like SOTN as it is showing itself to be) but afterward im probably gonna pick up sotn again and play that.",Recommended
Great game!,Recommended
"I was so skeptical of this game because of the numerous kickstarter failures, but Iga totally pulled through.  The old memories of Symphony of the Night and Aria of Sorrow just flooded back, it's so very good.\n\nAll the old mechanics are almost perfectly recreated, the attacks, the abilities, the enemies, everything is nearly perfect.  Then on top of that they added new mechanics that give you more ways to level up your character and give you tons of things to collect.\n\nThe combat especially feels so good.  All the weapon types have their own little quirks that you can take advantage of and none of them feel bad to use.  You get excited when you find a new piece of equipment, and that's so rare these days.\n\nIf you held a gun to my head and told me I had to say one bad thing about the game, sometimes you run into roadblocks where you have no idea where to go next.  I kind of like that the game doesn't hold my hand and show me the next area, but maybe some people don't like wandering around a castle for 2 hours trying to figure out where to use the item you just got.  If you're like me, you actually get a lot of gratification figuring that kind of stuff out.\n\nI'm totally blown away, I thought it was going to be good but it blows good right out of the water.  I beat the game but I'm still playing because unlocking the achievements is an entire other game in itself.",Recommended

"I've been (somewhat) following this game's progress, and the final product is, I have to say, a breath of fresh air in a world where trailers are great but the game itself is mediocre at best, atrocious at worst. This game did the opposite of that, and mad props for it, this is how it SHOULD be.\n\nThe game itself is very much what you'd expect from a Metroidvania game (for obvious reasons) and plays quite well, I personally haven't played a game like this since Order of Ecclesia, so when I saw the gameplay after it got released, I picked it up.\n\nDo I regret it? Absolutely not. It definitely scratches that itch that's been bugging me since the Lords of Shadow series dropped. Don't get me wrong, they were fine games (fine as in serviceable, whether you liked them or not was up to you), but they weren't Metroidvania.\n\nThat being said, there are a few niggling things that bother me about this game, but to its credit, some of them are series personal problems, and not game-breaking bugs and the like.\n\nFirst of all, pacing. This is a very common problem in blind runs of Metroidvania games, where you can't access an area until you get an upgrade, then spend three hours trying to find the exact spot where you need to be. It doesn't help that the map is bog-standard and has no helpful tips or design that helps differentiate between areas. A simple colour change for different areas, and a small marker for areas that require an ability and this problem instantly vanishes, and it doesn't even have to be shoehorned in via a cutscene or the protagonist talking to themselves. However, this game has a particular part where you need a certain ability [i] that is not a boss drop [/i] meaning you'll figure out how to proceed accidentally by killing the right enemy. So if you're unlucky and don't want to ruin the experience with a walkthrough, you're just going to be frustrated until the solution presents itself, which does not come as a relief, but as a ""WTF, HOW WAS I SUPPOSED TO KNOW TO DO THAT"" moment. A spot of bad form in an otherwise decent game.\n\nMy second problem is enemy balance. Some enemies have moves that come out lightning fast or cover a lot of ground, meaning you won't actually dodge them unless you were already moving away from them. Your character is not fast and backdashing doesn't create a lot of space, so you're going to be jumping a lot, which is fine, but if the enemy decides to do a certain move, you are GOING to get hit, regardless of your positioning. There aren't a lot of enemies who can do this, but the ones that do feel cheap instead of difficult.\n\nWhich brings me to my next gripe. FARMING AND HEALING.\n\nWhy, oh why, is there a crafting system in this game? Grinding is NEVER fun, anything that halts your progress is NEVER fun and LIMITS ON FARMING is counter-productive and actually makes a mechanic that has no business being in the game EVEN WORSE! Why the heck is there a limit to healing items, WHEN THERE IS A WAY TO FARM AND CRAFT THEM? It makes no sense! This is perhaps my biggest beef with the game. You can craft by farming resources, but the stuff you craft is generally not worth making (except for buffing your skills, this is DEFINITELY worth doing), weapons, gear, etc. all worthless, you find better stuff on the map and Spells/abilities are better than weapons anyway. In fact, due to the previous problem I listed, Spells are actually VASTLY superior to weapons, since you can use them from range, they come in all forms of damage and have multiple effects. The drop system in previous games in this genre was ALWAYS OPTIONAL, you never HAD to grind/farm for anything (except in Aria of Sorrow, and tellingly, that was never a problem again until now).\n\nHonestly, if you're going to limit healing, don't put in a system that encourages players to grab as much loot as they can, it results in a lot of backtracking, further slowing progress.\n\nHOWEVER:\n\nDespite my major beef with these three problems, I still FULLY recommend the game. I even give it the full price approval rating, something I don't often do, it's that good and hopefully the first in a line of titles.",Recommended

"Hailing from legendary producer and game designer Koji Igarashi and his studio Artplay, it is no wonder that Bloodstained feels like a worthy successor to his work on the previous partial namesake of Metroidvania, the Castlevania series post-Symphony of the Night.

Where Mighty Number 9 flounders, Bloodstained rises to the top. Igarashi wanted to make Castlevania, but Konami didn’t have the interest to let him, and here we are.

"[h1] The Introduction [/h1]\nIn many ways, the production journey of “Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night” mirrors that of “Mighty No. 9,” though the final fate left uncertain until now. In fact, Koji Igarashi was directly inspired by the success of Keiji Inafune breaking from the monolithic studios and their legacy IP to recapture the essence of what made those games so great in the first place. Where Inafune looked back to his work on the MegaMan franchise for “Mighty No. 9”, Igarashi drew upon his experience with Castlevania as the inspirational cornerstone for “Bloodstained.” Both artists called upon fans with speculatory prospects; both received resounding shouts of support with record-setting Kickstarter campaigns; and both lingered in a frustrating limbo for quite some time too. Yet, while the journey of ‘Mighty No. 9” unfortunately ended up a cautionary reminder of limitation and tempered expectation, the final destination for “Bloodstained” is a restoration of faith in those grand, lofty ambitions of capturing lighting in a bottle again.  \n\n\n[h1] The Full Premise (In A Digestible Summary): [/h1]\n“Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night” is a nicely complex (and of course convoluted) story in a batshit crazy and historically-influenced-yet-totally-fantasy world. In this quasi nineteenth-century setting, alchemists wield incredibly dangerous knowledge and exert great power over the very forces of nature… even Hell itself. Nevertheless, their influenced waned in the advents of the Industrial Revolution.\n\nIn a bid to restore their former glory, The Alchemical Guild long experimented on vulnerable individuals with involuntary procedures forcing demon crystals into their bodies. Some called it a blessing, as each shard added allows them to call forth great demonic powers. Others recognized the curse, as the corruption slowly destroys their essence and inevitably renders their bodies entirely crystalline. Our protagonist is one such person, a Shardbinder. \n\nAn orphan victimized by these Alchemists, Miriam has vowed to use her cursed gifts to strike back and defend those in need. It’s been a decade since the inner circle of the Alchemical Guild first opened the Gates of Hell, and when she joined the charge against their demon hordes. While ultimately successful in sealing the threat, Miriam has remained frozen away in time these last ten years. Here our journey with Miriam now begins as she finds herself awakened when another Shardbinder—her former ally---seeks to reopen that pathway to Hell and unleash all its fury upon mankind.\n\n\n[h1]The Game’s Offerings: [/h1]\nWell, the promised spiritual successor to “Castlevania Symphony of the Night” is a promise come Recommended. Here’s what to expect of this Metroidvania:\n\n* The traditionally MASSIVE Castle of interconnected rooms, filled with so many secrets & secret paths that the intrigue of exploration itself often dictates your path (and thoughts of treasures only the dedicated explorers might uncover) \n\n* Those base RPG mechanics (usual Vit/Dex/Int/etc stat numbers) which you can amplify with gear bonuses.  And, as always, you level based on your experience murdering the shit out of everything. While some aren’t fond of RPG leveling in Metroidvanias, it matches the SOTN roots. Many others (cough cough) appreciate the potential trade-off spending time to level through bottleneck areas that otherwise might end their game. For those hardcore players there’s always more advanced difficulties and speed runs where the field gets leveled.  \n\n* A series of side-quests with item rewards from the citizens hiding out at your base area. Their presence gives an added life to the area as your “claim” and even a slight sense of progression as one grows crops you choose and you’re checking in to complete/take-on quests. \n\n* All kinds of weaponry (whips indeed) and demon magic are available. You’ll discover some specific combo attacks per weapon class, but it’s magic that really steals the show. While health is static (barring potions/save rooms), your MP slowly regenerates allowing a nice mixture of powerful magic-as needed among your flurry of blades.\n\n* Each magic category has its own bind to activate in combat, and within each category there’s a litany of powers to discover that can be switched in-and-out at will. Most you’ll find at random, as combat drops from specific enemies, which both stack in power with each found and can be updated based on related item-drops found.\n\n* Intricate alchemy/crafting options are available for all those item drops, as well as a store to rid yourself of extras or fill ingredient gaps. There’s even a cooking system that plays into side quests, where each new food tried offers permanent stat boosts.  \n\n* The 2.5D approach here is absolutely the way to go. While purists may dislike the move away from 2D given the inspirations, it’s a cosmetic alteration offering killer character models and beautiful cutscenes while enabling the same classic gameplay functionally.\n\n* A backstory of high stakes with character revelations doled out as you progress. Alongside the normal cut-scene story development, usual game interactions (store/craft/upgrade) are accompanied by casual chat providing additional characterization and clarifying background details.\n\n\n[H1] The Style and Themes: [/h1]\nAs a spiritual successor to “Symphony of the Night” (in case the full title “Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night” didn’t bang any bells for you) there’s obviously a large amount of dark Gothic elements in the game design. Like Castlevania, it’s really more of a 17th/18th century setting paired with an exploration of the Gothic ruins and citadels built centuries earlier.  There are some interesting commonalities with actual historical works too which very much surprised me. They even reference John Dee, and demon categorization is based on the Lesser Key of Solomon and the 72 entities it cataloged.\n\nHowever, it’s really how the game diverges from the Castlevania setting that yields the most interesting design and thematic elements. Aside from the obvious inclusion of alchemy, much of the setting seemingly harkens to “Fullmetal Alchemist,” including the underlying body-horror and the emotional weight of transformations and dehumanization. And the fantasy setting probably helps rationalize the other more modern influences, like the transition from ""Gothic"" to ""Gothic Lolita"" with the fashion. Or the sexy kickboxing, which didn’t really take off until centuries after originally introduced in the middle ages. \n\n[h1] The Miscellaneous Mentions: [/h1]\nIf you want to [u]jump right into the hardest difficulties[/u], there’s a classic cheat code by naming your character “NIGHTMARE” at the start for all you hardcore fuckers out there. Not me, I’m glad normal is do-able enough to squeeze my simple ass through. (And you can actually change the name back right after too, showing some other smarty-pants design)\n\nThere’s [u]a shitload more content coming up too [/u]  with 13 free DLC available that cover speed runs, boss rush, and outfits unlocked by the bonus Kickstarter tiers. The very next one being an update for the second playable character voiced by none other than 'Big Old Solid Naked Boss' himself, David Hayter. \n\nOh yeah, the map! [u]The mini-map is amazing: [/u] sure it goes on/off, or you can fully change the size, transparency and even location all over the screen as you track custom targets. This is the new gold standard.\n\nThe review got cut off, [url=https://steamcommunity.com/groups/WeirdWonderfulGameWatch/discussions/5/1643166649093781099/] though you can finish here [/url]\n\nAnd checkout [URL=https://store.steampowered.com/app/692850/Bloodstained_Ritual_of_the_Night/?curator_clanid=32660416] Bloodstained on Steam now!\n[/URL]\n\nFor more recommendations please check our curator: [URL= https://store.steampowered.com/curator/32660416-Weird-Wonderful-Game-Watch/] Weird Wonderful Game Watch [/URL]",Recommended

"Plays like a culmination of the systems seen in Symphony of the Night, Order of Ecclesia and Aria of Sorrow.  I am very, very pleased with how this game turned out.",Recommended
"This game is exactly what it aims to be, a very good side scrolling action RPG that continues the legacy of another series that shall remain unnamed. It does everything right, and it comes together oh so well. Well worth the price tag, even when not on sale. Looking forward to those future content updates and the additional playable characters!",Recommended
"thank iga bring us a so fantastic castle, really thanks.\nthank unreal engine and devs make my i3-4170 gtx750Ti pc can run with full ultra graphics at 1080p 60Hz in full process. it's not only a nice igavania game but also a nice unreal engine example.\nthank composer michiru's music.",Recommended
"Don't think there's anything I can say that hasn't been said by everyone else already. If you loved Igarashi's Castlevania games (SotN, the GBA games and all the NDS games) then you will love this. Bigger, longer, more fun and turned out to be way better than I expected it to be and the game isn't even finished yet. Lots of free DLC coming to bump the replayability even further than it already has. \n\nGreat game you can just pick up and play and grind to full completion.",Recommended
"Outdated gameplay \n\nIt looks gorgeous, but ignores the super basics of interesting gameplay\n\n1. This drove me up the wall, I can't attack upwards or downwards. I've got all these weapons but I can only attack using horizontal angles with my basic attack?  You can equip a basic weapon, the gun and your special ability allows you to aim around at all angles to fire a bolt of magic, but with a gun you can only fire horizontally. \n2. Weapon animations are the exact same for every attack you do. There aren't any combos, it doesn't feel like you are doing anything different than spamming the light attack in streetfighter 2. \n3. Story is REALLY cliche. I'm a magical girl that was cursed by blah blah blah and my adopted brother who I trust is a bad guy, I don't believe it *Gasp*. \n4. Graphics are hit or miss. For the most part, really good, but cut scenes are weird looking\n\nSummation: \nIf this game was released 20 years ago, it would be amazing (minus graphics of course). Today, it ignores the last 20 years of gameplay decisions and evolution in favor of making head scratching combat design decisions.",Not Recommended
"I will keep this short and sweet, as I could write about this game for what seems like hours on end;\n\nThis is the Recommended spiritual sequel to SOTN, by the genius who designed SOTN himself. Do yourself a favor and play it. You won't be sorry.",Recommended
"Amazing game, I highly recommend it!",Recommended
"TLDR: It's fantastic and exactly what i wanted. Iga knocked it clean out of the park.\n\nOk so for the non-spoiler-y review, The game is incredible. It's gorgeous and plays exactly how it should, has a wonderful mix of several other vania games and i can hear bits of SoTN music thrown in with some of the tracks in here too. I'd recommend it to anyone and everyone as it's now my favorite metroidvania and one of my favorite games I've played in the last decade.\n\nNow for the spoiler-y bits.\n\n I am kind of disappointed that the inverted castle isn't it's own thing, you just get the ability to invert yourself and flip everything through the existing levels but it's a pretty big map as is. There's so many little nods to SoTN in here, like using the high jump on the librarian (O.D) multiple times, the waterfall bit in the map is nearly identical to the one in SoTN, though alas, no shoes to make yourself taller it seems. While i haven't finished the story yet, it does carry around the same way SoTN did, where you can finish it early and get a not-good/unfinished ending, or you can keep going, fight more bosses, uncover more lore and eventually get the good/Recommended ending.\n\nAll in all, i highly recommend to anyone who just likes good video games.",Recommended
"The game is amazing, IF you get to play it long enough without it freezing and having to be closed via the task manager.\nBecause the game doesn't autosave but oldschool save points, you can loose quite a bit of progress this way.",Not Recommended
Amazing game! \n\nYou should buy this game because it is just like the classic Castlevania games!,Recommended

"For Castlevania fans, this game is a dream come Recommended. 10 years after the excellent Order of Ecclesia comes this, the very first Igavania high definition console 'Vania. If you like Symphony of the Night, or Dawn of Sorrow, you will love this game. There really isn't much to be said. Recommended, there are some rough spots, the cutscenes are little rough, but overall just an incredible game. If you ever wanted an HD version of SOTN, this is the closest you will get. It feels like 20 years passed in the blink of an eye.\n\nFull disclosure, i backed the kickstarter for this, but when it started getting good early reviews, i had to double dip and get a Steam release. Looks/plays incredible on Steam.",Recommended

I was broke during the crowdfunding stage of this game. Years and years I waited waiting in the shadows. Now it is released oh boy it is so good. I never imagined that I'd be able to play another masterpiece from Igarashi again.,Recommended
i havent had this much fun with a game in a long time. makes me want to play games more often again.,Recommended
"My favorite improvement this game makes over other Metroidvanias is the loadout system. You can set up gear loadouts on the menu, then hold down L trigger and quickly swap to them with the Left Stick. I never liked swapping gear to suit a situation in Symphony of the Night because it took so long. But in this game I had fun setting up the quick swaps.",Recommended
"As an original backer back in 2015, This game is everything I ever hope for. Worth every penny and all that time waiting. \nIt's basically SoTN from PS1 with lots of new items and mechanics. If you like that game you'll definitely love this.\n\npaid 60$ and still think it's worth the price. Kudos to Igarashi-sama.",Recommended
It is Bloody Awesome! 10/10! Would buy Again!,Recommended
"This is probably the only Metroidvania I've ever played that I could not put down as soon as I started. I enjoyed the heck out of my first playthrough, and I'm having fun blasting through New Game+ as well.",Recommended
"Koji Igarashi managed to combined almost all Castlevania games into two games which are Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night and Bloodstained: Curse of the Moon.\nHe really payed all his efforts to produce a perfect and a complete Metroidvania game!\nAlso, he brought legacy team members such as the wonderful pioneer composer, the one and only Michiru Yamane!\nShe managed to produce Gothic rock soundtrack carries it all forward on leading a powerful soundtracks and soothing tunes. It can shift from calming and lovely to threatening to pumping you up, depending on where you are, each soundtrack creating a personality for the battle or location you’re exploring. The quality of the music is nothing but a legend created by a legend. Her touch ties an already-excellent game together.\nThis game is simply a timeless gem indeed.",Recommended
This game is dope. Play it.,Recommended

"This is a huge, massive punch in konami's face, fuck konami, IGA is still on his track. This game gives me a nostalgia yet brand new experience from every perspective, it's symphony of the night but fancier. Idk its a good thing or not, the music in the game is so identical to SOTN's soundtrack. the game do have some minor bugs but it doesn't really bothers you. 100/10 the Recommended Castlevania sequel people dreamed about.",Recommended
*dress description promises translucent appearance\n*farming for mats to make that dress\n*dress uses default model with no translucence at all\n*finishes the game anyway cause it's fun,Recommended
This game is the only game where I feel the need to 100% Complete it because of godamn good it is,Recommended
"-It has been a while since I've gotten to experience that classic metroidvania feel, and while I very much loved Hollow Knight, it didn't exactly scratch that itch, more so it stood on its own merits to give me a completely different experience altogether. Which is why i personally do not want to compare the two nor choose one or the other. If you are looking for a game that has solid world-building, a well-developed ensemble of chars, and an engrossing atmospheric set of areas, then you go with HN. However, if you're missing that freedom of customization, the experimentation wide array of abilities, classic vampire hunting aesthetic, and fast paced combat this is definitely the game for you.\n\n-The graphics are definitely a huge upgrade from the previous version, and I can definitely say that they tried as much as they can to put in the work in making the atmosphere of the castle a lot better. \n\nPROS:\n\n-The story is very run-of-the-mill Castlevania style which takes bits of elements from its spiritual predecessors like Symphony of the Night, Aria of Sorrow, and Order of Ecclessia. Nothing deep, but serviceable as gameplay is really thee main draw of these games. To give credit though, the lore bits you find flesh out Miriam and some of the other cast a bit more than most other games of its ilk. As much as I like Shanoa, I am glad that Miriam didn't turn out to be a completely carbon copy of her with even less emotion as I thought she might've ended up. She interacts with the cast more and is given more backstory than most Castlevania protags.\n\n-Gameplay is solid and harks back to the style of Aria/Dawn of Sorrow and Order of Ecclesia with the shard system (Seriously guys. Stop calling this SOTN. Personally am getting sick of that game and ONLY that game and super 4 being talked to death when there are plenty of gems in the series). There are 5 shards that can be changed, and one that can be obtained that allows you to switch equipment sets on the fly, allowing for plenty of customization. \n\n-The controls are tight and move/respond as other metroidvanias do. Seriously, the people who call the game slow have never played a castlevania game in their life. The speed is fine and animations will only look slow due to the 2.5d graphics and/or you being slow/bad platformers. \n\n-Miriam's char model is for the most part customizable.\n\n-Lots of weapon types exist in the game with a plethora of special abilities that make them worth experimenting and grinding for if you are into that, allowing for a myriad of playstyles and this will only become a further positive once NG+ is made available so that you can run through the game with an assortment of these weapons.\n\n-Free DLC. More playable chars, more modes, and frikin coop coming soon.\n\n-Shovel Knight is in this game as a familiar, and as a playable equip armor.\n\nCONS\n\n-The soundtrack has some decent tracks here and there, but overall, the score imo just feels weak and generic. The voice acting is also pretty mediocre, with the Japanese ones being a bit better in terms of delivery. As much as I love David Hayter's Snake, he honestly just doesn't do a whole lot for Zangetsu.\n\n-There are still some minor glitches here and there. Main ones I have experienced include a softlock when I open the menu too often, monster drop bags being frozen in suspension for a couple of seconds, and some sound glitches here and there. These shouldn't kill your experience and I have no doubt they will be addressed. \n\n-Depending on your shards, level, and equipment the game can become far too easy as many bosses feel like they can be bruteforced. Healing items feel a bit too accessible and can easily be abused, taking away a lot of challenge and needed strategy required to beat these bosses. Granted, there is a hard mode which I have yet to try, so maybe that can provide a much better challenge for veteran players.\n\n-Story could be a bit better. As I mentioned it is pretty run of the mill, but considering they went to put in some effort into developing Miriam and Gebel's origin story I feel that a lot of the cast could've gotten some screentime as well. Some major villains in the late game don't get a lot of screentime or development to make their roles and their bossfights as climactic as they could've been. The end game areas also feel a bit too short and don't even so much as have  much worthwhile loot either aside from some room keys that unlock certain boss monsters. Gebel as a character is also heavily under utilized and gets kicked back hard later in the game.\n\nOVERALL\n\n-The issues I have with the game for the most part are minor with my biggest gripes mostly being the lack of difficulty in bossfights (at least on normal mode) and the end game feeling a bit lackluster in terms of map length and story climax. Gameplay however is just plain and crazy fun. The shards are easily the best iteration of the Tactical Soul System and Glyph System and the weapon variety and skills that come with each type knock Dawn of Sorrow's take on it out the stratosphere. Seriously. Very good, fast, and responsive combat.\n \n-The game is solid and really live up to what the fans have been missing for the last couple of years. I would say the numerous delays were well worth the wait. If you have been meaning to scratch that castlevania itch, this is definitely the game you have been waiting for, and with the DLCs coming in to further add to the serviceable amount of content it has already, this is definitely worth the $40 pricetag. \n\n8/10 for me. You did it again Iga. Take notes AAA devs. This is how you respond to criticism, and I can only hope that this game and many others serve as an example. I can wholeheartedly say I am eager for a sequel already and hope that this is not just a one note thing. Bloodstained has what it takes to be the new Castlevania and I hope it does become so in the near future.",Recommended
"Honestly I'm quite happy with this game.\nIt has been years since I hadn't played a new Castlevania game (I don't consider the 2 reboot games to be Castlevania games) with the last games being Aria of Sorrow, Dawn of Sorrow and Order of Ecclesia and since Order of Ecclesia released arround 10 to 11 years ago no new Castlevania game had been released.\nBut the long drought ends now.\nBloodstained: Ritual of the Night is a Castlevania game in everything but it's name. If you enjoyed Castlevania games up to and including Order of Ecclesia there is a really high chance you'll enjoy Bloodstained. Everything in this game is a love letter to ""old"" Castlevania games From the mechanics, the esthetic of the game and the musics so much so that once I finished the game the first time I was half in glee to have been able to play a ""New Castlevania"" and half cursing Konami for not releasing any new Castlevania in any forseeable future...\nAnyway this is a great game and any Castlevania fan will more than likely enjoy it. As for the ""is it worth the 40€ price tag?"" question, yes it is well worth it.",Recommended

"SUMMARY: A not-Castlevania game that's as Castlevania as it gets, delivering everything people loved across the series, with a big focus on SoTN/Ecclesia/Soma arc methods.  Craft items, get weapons, steal monster's powers, fight bosses, and explore a giant surreal castle.  A few janky bits here and there can be irritating, but the game delivers pure fun and fulfills everything it promises.\n\nTo summarize this game to fans: It's like the Castelvania series was a band, and another band popped up that hit all the riffs, licks, and stylings you loved and then some.  So if you like Castlevania games, you'll probably be happy.\n\nFor non-fans, well, this is a Metroidvania game of exploring a gothic castle, fighting monsters, making items, getting powers, and finding new paths.  Based on the game series that inspired the genre, it delivers.\n\nNow, let's get to the details.\n\nAs per sort-of-Castlevania protocol, you're a woman with a mysterious past, able to adsorb the powers of demons summoned into human forms.  Your goal is to defeat a fellow survivor of horrible occult experiments by breaking into the warped castle he inhabits before he devestates the world with monsters.  A variety of colorful allies help you in this endeavor.  It's Castlevania standard.\n\nSo let's break down the game:\n\nExploring: The castle is weird, glorious, surreal, and beautiful.  It's got winding paths, hidden areas, backtracking, and surprises.  Traversal is pretty easy with the help of teleport spots and the map, and is well-thought out - it feels less grindy than some incarnations of this genre.\n\nFighting: Fighting is a big part of the game, and it comes with a huge variety of weapons, moves, armor, ""shards"" that grant powers, and so on.  A lot of the game is learning your favorite moves and equipment.  Combat has janky moments, but is mostly straightforward.\n\nMonster Powers: Sometimes when you kill a monster, you steal it's ""shard"" and get powers related to that monster.  A large variety of shards are available, and some are unlocked through specific actions.  These add all sorts of extras to combat, and you can improve them.\n\nCrafting: Potions, food, and equipment can be crafted with materials you find - and once you make something you can buy it in the shop.  Plus these activities can help fulfill quests.  Crafting is straightforward, and the use of materials you find makes monster-mashing fulfilling - as you're always finding stuff to use.\n\nQuests: The ruined town you're based in has various people to send you off on quests for more loot and options.  Some of these are their own challenges, from crafting items to killing certain monsters.  Some are purely helpful, like crop growing.\n\nIt's a huge, HUGE pile of stuff, like an overloaded gift bag.  It's all fun, wild, and there's a lot to do.  You're always unlocking new things, finding new equipment, making new equipment, and so on.  In some ways it's overdone, but the series that inspired it was never one for subtlety - the game enjoys it's excess.\n\nVisually, the game looks great.  Nice environments, some really beautiful architecture, and good character designs.\n\nAudio-wise, you've got the great music you should expect from not-Castlevania, and some nice audio bits for the monsters.  Plus the voice acting ranged from decent to good.\n\nA man may be a miserable pile of secrets, but this is a joyful pile of beloved game elements.\n\n\nSo who is this for:\n* If you like Castlevania, just buy it.  You're going to anyway.\n* If you like the Metroidvania type games and somehow never played a Castlevania, buy it.\n* As for anyone else who somehow has had experiences with neither genres, it's a good action RPG with plenty of exploring and crafting.\n\n",Recommended
"A very enjoyable experience, the game captures the atmosphere perfectly, combine with the amazing soundtracks the game had me constantly on the edge of my seat. Although the gameplay is solid and well balanced, certain areas do get on my nerves sometime but overall does not impact the experience this game offers. I highly recommend this game.",Recommended
"It has been a while so I think its time to update my review. Overall I love the game. If I had to compare it to the previous metroidvania castlevania games, I would prefer this over all of them. With the exception of one thing, it doesn't have any of the problems I have had with the previous games.\n\nCharacters:\nI am not biggest fan of the cast. I love their design but the characters themselves are very simple. There are 3 characters I really love though. Zangetsu due to him being a tsundere voiced by Solid Snake. OD because he is basically Alucard with a bunch of Jojo references.\nAnd finally our MC, Miriam. I love her design and I love her character. At first I was worried that she would be just a Waifu whether be it too cheerful or too emotionless (japan really needs to stop this waifu shit). But she is not a waifu. She is a character. She has her cute moments and sad moments. I like that. She is no Estelle Bright but she is very good non the less.\n\nControls:\nSmooth as butter. Miriam feels really nice. Running, jumping and attacking all feel right.\n\nThe map:\nThis is really impotrant in a metroidvania I find. TimeSpinner for example had a really lackluster map. That being said Ritual of the Night feels just right. Every area has a lot to explore and the game never feels like a linear line.\n\nThe presentation:\nI really like the way the game looks. Every enemy has its own death animation too which is a really nice touch. The music is amazing as well. \n\nThe secrets and details:\nThis game has a lot of small details and secrets. I won't spoil them but its the same kinda attention to detail that I loved in SOTN.\n\nThe shards:\nI love the shards system, its really great. its basically the aria of sorrow system which I always loved. The  alchemy system is also very nice. You can make weapons or upgrade your shards for additional effects. By the end of my 100% run, Miriam was basically an over powered Jojo character.\n\nThe difficulty and the bosses:\nI don't like this. The game is too easy. Some people say ""Oh its the CHOICE of difficulty. You make the game as hard as you want it to be by NOT USING certain stuff"". This kinda thinking I never liked. I have these options I should be ENCOURAGED to used them and still have a challenge. Its the same problem SOTN had. The bosses are basically damage sponges waiting to be killed. Why dodge the boss when I can obliterate them in mere seconds.\n\nWhy  go out of my way to make Blue Rose which requires SO MUCH materials to make when I can just make Crisseagrem which requires less materials and is MUCH better.  The game needs to be balanced. Order of Ecclysia for example did a fantastic job with this. You could get super strong but if you didn't pay attention the bosses could still beat you very easily.",Recommended
symphony of the night with anime tiddies\n\nbuy it,Recommended
"An absolutely great game, however there are a few things that should be addressed.... \nIf the game has a tendency to freeze, there should be an option to send in crash reports so the devs can actually do something about it. I've been having freezes at the dumbest times and I dunno why, when having luckbased farming in a game you shouldn't be able to just lose it all to a random freeze. (Backup autosaves on screen transition in case of crash if they can't be fixed?)\n\nAnother thing is loot getting stuck in places you can't get it, because the loot isn't granted on touch it seems (Why?). This is a VERY common thing to happen. And this isn't about killing a mob in a wall, it's just loot falling on the wrong corner of the environment as an example.\n\nAnd the last complaint would be controls occasionally getting stuck, especially related to water, I've had softlocks from being unable to do anything at all in water, and had no warp stones to get away from it. Mostly just randomly all buttons doing nothing, but had one where I charged my melee weapon in water and I just never swung it. Just kept the weapon over my head and no controls responded anymore, couldn't jump out of the water, couldn't finish the swing.\n\nOther than that, -very- recommended for anyone enjoying metroidvanias in mostly Castlevania spirit. Love the game.",Recommended
"I'll write more when I'm not playing but I must say- This is modern SotN and if that was your favorite in the series, this one will surely be your new fave...",Recommended
"This game is just all around fantastic... What can I say? I'm a huge fan of Symphony of the Night, probably one of my favorite Castlevania titles ever. This game is it's spiritual successor in every way. The music the combat everything is just perfect. I cannot state how much I love this game! 2 hours in and i'm already wandering around like a doofus figuring out where to go but man do i enjoy every second of it! This takes every element of the later GBA Castlevania titles and mixes it all together. The soul dominance from Aria of Sorrow adds a nice touch of variety to the combat that they've added to this game. If you loved Symphony of the Night and even the newer style GBA Castlevania games then what are you waiting for?!?! This game is it! The graphics music and combat are all 10/10!!!!!!!! Worth it!",Recommended
"i dont normally write reviews but god damn i feel so happy playin this game. shit hasnt been this real since 1999. yall know what the fuck im talkin about. Symphony Of the Gottamn Night hasnt been this lit for a minute. they brought every Iga combat or ability system they could think of. All the physics? Yup. Can you still backdash to go faster than walking? Yes, but it works slightly differently. Can you farm enemies for badass weapons? Of course my guy. Animation canceling by attacking midair so you can sneak in a free hit as soon as you land? Hell yeah, Iga wouldn't leave you hanging. Can you jump off of an enemys head by doing a down kick after your double jump? Yeah, for fucking sure. Dummy big map to explore + more weapons and armor than you could dream of? Yeet. Can you get souls and upgrade them like them fuckin gameboy ones i cant remember the name of? You're god damn right you can son.\n \nBut I hear you. You're a real one.

"[h1]What the Alchemists did was to reshuffle our bodies. What I intend to do is to reshuffle the world. I'd say I've earned the right.[/h1]\n[b]-- Gebel[/b]\n__________________________________________\n\n'Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night' was the first game I kind-of pre-ordered since Dark Souls III back in 2016. In fact this is the only game I ever even backed via Kickstarter some years ago.  \nYeah, I was 'kind-of-hyped' for the release - to put it very mildly.\n\nI grew up with Symphony of the Night/Circle of the Moon/Dawn of Sorrow/Order of Ecclesia/... and in the past years I played nearly all of the Indie titles that luckily still keep the genre alive nowadays.\nValdis Story, Guacamelee, Axiom Verge, Salt & Sanctuary, Hollow Knight to name some of them. So many hours of fun, so many fantastic titles, such a great mix of the well-known Metroidvania formula with interesting new ideas and settings.\n \nHowever, if I had to make a short comparison: after playing Bloodstained for some hours now, this game really feels like 'coming home' after all those years. This is neither me saying that the other titles were no fun (which they definitely were) nor that they messed up the formula (which they definitely did not) but instead it is the fact that Bloodstained feels [i]exactly[/i] like the Castlevania games I gew up with.\n\nThe combat. The exploration. The areas. The items. The soundtrack. The atmosphere. \nYup, they nailed it. 110%.\n__________________________________________\n\nThe visuals may look a bit strange at first glance but you get used to them quite quickly. Some of those close-up character models during conversations and the 'kind-of-out-of-place' Poltergeist/Backer portraits aside it is a beautiful game with an amazing soundtrack (plus more than just solid voice acting!).\n\nSure, the game needs some more polishing (e.g. some wall colissions are weird) and there are a few glitches every now and then (e.g. items get stuck in walls/floors, random crashes when reading a book (happened to me once)) but overall this release is definitely on the safer side, especially compared to some other launch experiences in the past years.\n__________________________________________\n\nI'm 17 hours in so far. The map is unfinished, I've only seen the bad ending and my collection of enemies, items and shards still lacks a lot of entries. Oh boy, I am happy.\n\nAt the moment I don't even want to move on. I simply pump up my luck stat to max and grind for missing items and shards. And I love every second of it.\n\n[b]EDIT:[/b] 30 hours on the clock now and I finished the game with the good ending somewhere around 25 hours. Grinding is still fun, plus now I'm even more hyped for the new characters and the other DLC. In the end the game's exactly what I wanted: a new Metroidvania with the good-old Castlevania vibes!",Recommended
"Order of Ecclesia 2 with a hint of Aria of Sorrow and a dash of Symphony of the Night, how could I not recommend it?",Recommended
"I can't recommend this game. It seems that the extra 2 years didn't help the game. The looting feels lackluster, feeling like you're not really getting good variations. I've been running with the same items for over half of my playtime. The graphics are sometimes jarring. Like the models for characters chatting look like they're from last generation. Your character is slow to move with no movement techniques to help you dodge and only 1 weapon slot so you can't even try to use a shield and single handed weapon. Your abilities don't feel like they have any power to them, most likely due to your character seeming weaker then it should be. At lv 40 I'm doing less then 100 damage, which is scaled to the enemies around me but feels like there is no power behind it.\n\nThe aesthetic is good, though. I love the theme that the game is running and the overall art design. When the combat is in its element it's fun to play. Wondering the map is pretty fun, running through new areas feels nice and fun to explore. (Until you get to a part like I did where you're running around the map for 5 hours trying to figure out the next area. Only to find out you needed to talk to an out of the way npc with no hint that you needed to.)\n\nPeople say this is as good as SOTN, I beg to differ. This isn't SOTN, this game is Aria of Sorrow. Your character is more of a less mobile female Soma Cruz then she is Alucard. If you want SOTN, just go play the original. This isn't the game you're looking for. If you want a decent metroidvania you can try this later when we get everything we were promised from the kickstarter.",Not Recommended
"Is it as good as SotN? Almost. Is it a damn fine Metroidvania? Hell yes.  \n\nDisclosure: I'm a Kickstarter Backer. It was in-fact the first thing I ever backed on Kickstarter. I elected for the $250 tier and I have no regrets. \n\nRitual of the Night is a Kickstarter success story, make no mistake. I'm not going to into too much depth about how excellently crafted the various elements are. Others have done that much better than I could ever. Instead I want to talk about my experience playing it: When I entered the game's main castle, and I was floored by the joy of exploring. As I moved forward, the map kept unfurling more and more, offering more paths to explore and find all sorts of rewards! This is one of the most powerful moments I've had in gaming. Last time I felt it was playing SotN. \n\nNow for the negatives that I haven't seen others talk about: Combat feels off. This is something I need to investigate further, but it's some combination of: your hit-box being too large, your attacks being too slow, some of the awkward clipping with the environment, how short your post-hit invincibility is, or movement feeling to slow. That last one I know is a massive departure from SotN, as your backstep is used by Speedrunners to get through that game faster. Here, it's got a longer cool-down. I will say that my experience improved as I found new weapons, all of which offered new ways to play the game. That's a big point in its favor. What I explained in this paragraph is why I can't get behind the ""IT'S SOTN!"" Train. It just misses the target. \n\nAnd of course, there's the drama. It's Kickstarter, so of course there's drama. Drama I'm sure will surprise you to hear actually exists with this project: 505 Games is a dumpster fire of a Publisher**. It was a mistake for Iga to partner with them. That happened after the crowdfunding campaign ended, so I was locked in. It seemed like nothing bad came from the deal, despite my fear. Until a month ago, weeks before the game released, they announced the ""Iga's Backpack"" DLC. This was content advertised years ago on the original Kickstarter on the $60 Tier as ""Backer Exclusive Content"". This was 505 Games' decision, one that Iga fought against. Hey, I'm cool with this content being offered as DLC... Eventually. Not on release. The $60 backers got doubly screwed. What was advertised was a lie, and if you buy the game and DLC at full price that's only $50.  \n\n""But they got Curse of the Moon for free! That adds up!"" Curse of the Moon was a stretch goal. It was to be _in addition to_ the Backer Exclusive Content. Also IT'S NOT WHAT THEY BACKED THE PROJECT FOR. If you can't see the danger this behavior from 505 Games, there is no hope for you. \n\nIn conclusion: Buy this game and share the experience with your friends. Advocate for Iga to find a new Publisher, and avoid 505 Games' other works like the plague. With any luck 505 Games will go bankrupt before screwing more gamers over for their bottom line**. \n\n**505 Games is responsible for what I described above. They're also responsible for adding pay-to-win loot crates to Payday 2.",Recommended
"My expectations for Bloodstained were very low. From its Kickstarter campaign, which heavily relied on the cult of personality surrounding Koji Igarashi, to the early graphics being a massive step down from the concept art, to its prolonged development cycle, I was expecting Bloodstained to be a mediocre game that failed to live up to its predecessors, joining the ranks of Yooka Laylee and Mighty No. 9.\n\nInstead, Bloodstained ended up being one of the best metroidvanias I've played in years, and an easy contender for my GOTY. The combat is snappy and fluid, the music is some of Michiru Yamane's best, there are hundreds of weapons and equippables and shiny baubles to experiment with, and even though I've finished the game, I'll start on New Game+ the moment I'm finished with this review.",Recommended
"Had any doubts? Did you like Symphony of the Night, Aria of Sorrow and/or Order of Ecclesia? BUY THIS NOW!\n\nI am 20h into the game over at GOG (yes I bought multiple versions!) and have yet to beat it. No guides or tutorials used and I love it.\n\n( Full disclosure: Backed this game $500 + $125 because I believed in the project. Would have backed more but I was a Slacker Backer, meaning the $500 was the roof, and all other higher tiers were closed. I have been around since late start and aided people with theorycrafting and such. I play this game mostly on GOG, but have it on Steam too just for modding reasons. Waiting on it for PS4 and Switch, EU.)\n\nCastlevania: Symphony of the Night is my top 1 game ever.\nBloodstained: Ritual of the Night is my top 2 game ever, so far, fighting for its first place!\n\n- Super nice and tight control, both on keyboard + mouse or with my xbox controler.\n- I feel the grind is spot on, not too much.\n- I love the soundtrack, the music will become a beacon in history for sure!\n- Graphics are 2,5D. It looks pretty and nice. I did enjoy some areas more than others for the mood.\n- Secrets, items, weapons, craftings, food, holy mac&cheese there are a lot of those in this game.\n- Learn special moves that will upgrade your choice of weapon the more you use it.\n- Customize our character to a degree, unlock by exploring the castle.\n- Leveling up, as it should be in a Recommended Metroidvania.\n- Shops and alchemy, story to unveil and funny gimmicks on the way.\n- Biggest castle in any IGAvania to date.\n- Enough replayvalue to pick up and finish over and over again.\n- Difficulty settings, which will be unlocked either by cheatcode (google it) or by completing the game.\n- Best god damn game I've played in yeaaars.\n\nBeen waiting 20 years for this game, a Recommended metroidvania. First Recommended metroidvania (now called IGAvania) since Order of Ecclesia. Everything else have been ""meeh"". The term metroidvania have been watered down, now people call Hollow Knight, Guacamelee and Dead Cells for metroidvania, heck, even Super Mario 64 is a metroidvania these days.\n\nIf you ever loved the original metroidvania, the Recommended metroidvania. This is what you have been waiting for. Remember the term IGAvania, so you do not get confused in the future.\n\nThis also mark the first IGAvania that will have updates and bugfixes along the way. It is exciting times.\n\nAll hail 2D, all hail IGAvania, and thank you Koji Igarashi for this craftmanship of pure art.

Fantastic,Recommended
"I don't know where to start with this game. Castlevania: Symphony of the Night was my 2nd PS1 game after Crash Bandicoot 2 as a kid. Super Castlevania IV was my first SNES game. I've always loved the franchise and hated to see what happened to it without Iga's passion behind the wheels.\n\nEnter Bloodstained. I'm going to preface this by saying that I've heard that some people have had technical issues including crashes. I've experienced none of this but will throw that out there.\n\nBloodstained is an awesome throwback to classic Metroidvania games (particularly Igavanias) that nails virtually every aspect of the subgenre. The gameplay, music, and visuals all help to build an experience that manages to capture the feel of games like SotN, Aria of Sorrow, and Order of Ecclesia. The controls are fluid and responsive (and yes, backdash canceling and jump canceling from the old games still work), there's LOADS of content to get through, and lots of fun zones to explore.\n\nAll the good fortunately isn't met with equal bad, however. There's some annoying indie jank that rears its head, but overall I would say that my issues with the game are 99% minor gripes. Items can get caught on strange angles in terrain, making them impossible to pick up. You can stand in the room for a while and it'll auto-pickup after a bit so I assume this was known about and boilerplated before launch. Secondly, there's some really wonky level transitions in the game a-la Dark Souls 2, but the areas themselves are cool. You'll just go to a new zone sometimes and say ""Wait a second, how is it logical for this to be here?"".\n\nThis is a no sleep review that I'll prolly update later, but in short, I love this game, and I think it's a solid port of an awesome experience that's worth buying if you or someone you know is a Castlevania fan.",Recommended
Great throw back to Castlevania: Symphony of the Night.,Recommended
"So far this is the best game I have played in years. It's got all the best parts (for me) of all my favorite metroidvanias plus stuff I didn't even know I want in one.\nThe weapons, the powers, the riddles, the secrets, boos, enemies and oh my god the music all done to nostalgic and still innovative perfection. \n10/10.\n\nAnd yeah I'm a Symphony of the Night fanboy so take it with a grain of salt if you aren't.",Recommended
"Leaving aside the graphic and audio issue, this game is brilliant, if you loved SOTN please, do yourself a favor and play this game, it's exactly the modernized version and maybe better of it. You really won't be disappointed. \n\nI hope there is some update at least in the 3D models, feels very ps2'ish and low quality(look at the little girls arm and hands). It would have been the perfect if the game was in pixel graphics. And the sound effects, feels cheap too, the voice acting of the NPCs  in your base and some of the main character are very annoying, Feels a bit rushed and very cheap for a 2019 game.\n\nin other hand the music and the controls, are very SoTN and AoS 'ish.",Recommended
"I've been waiting for a SoTN/AoS/OoE/etc clone for a while and it's finally here. \nThis game has been really enjoyable so far.  I'm a fan of the mechanics, the ability to farm, the shards mechanic like the older game where you could steal souls.  \n\nAll in all, I'm happy with the purchase.  I was a bit apprehensive because the price was so high.  After playing for 8.5 hours, I have zero remorse. \n\nGraphics are fine, music is what I'd expect from a title like this.  Control input, I found some settings to help with latency and really haven't had any issues there.  I've run into 1 crash to desktop in the 8.5 hours so far.\n",Recommended

"I backed this game so I received multiple copies.  I am playing it on the PS4 PRO.  \n\n\nSo like anybody who knows how great SOTN was, I was also greatly anticipating this game.  It has absolutely delivered. Not only is IGA all over this game but its incredibly fun and has that charm that SOTN did. It oozes style and everything is great from the design to the details of the graphics and how Miriam moves and such.  I am about 20 hours in on the PS4 version and its really awesome.  To anybody who just wants a  great looking game and one thats a lot of fun to play with tons of style, great music and very cool easter eggs (so far!) regarding SOTN and IGA in general, I would very much recommend this game.  With all the free DLCs that are coming its gonna be a lot of fun to play for a good while.  \n\nVery fun game so far!\n\n\nThis game has delivered on all my expectations so far.  We all owe a huge thank you to Koji Igarashi for making this amazing game.  \n\nIga, from me to you,  Thank you!  I have waited 22 years for this game!!!",Recommended
"[h1]Bloodstained is a masterpiece for a lost generation[/h1]\n\nStarting out with Symphony of the Night, and working through the entirety of the 90's, up to 2011 on every single castlevania game made in that era, Koji Igarashi is quite literally ""daddy castlevania""\n\nThat said, this is his latest work, and quite frankly a crowning jewel on two decades of some of the best games in the genre, that both sparked an entire new genre and franchise which proved lucrative to both Konami* and Koji himself.\n\nFollowing corporate shenanigans, Koji was told there was no more room in this world to create yet another gothic action adventure game, and told him to busy himself with other things. Koji said no. Koji left. Koji was handed ~6m US by his loyal fanbase and Koji spent the last 6 years building this masterpiece.\n\n[h1]Actual review[/h1]\n\n--<> Story <>--\n\nBloodstained: Ritual of the night is, as mentioned before, a masterpiece in it's genre. There will be heavy referencing to other works he made so if you haven't yet, be sure to play those as well.\n\nIt follows the story of Miriam, a girl recently awoken from a decade long slumber, Jonathan, a member of the alchemist guild and close friend of Miriam and Gebel, one of Miriam's old friends with a troubled past.\n\nAlong the way, many other characters of interest are introduced in beautifully executed cutscenes which are very reminiscent of Symphony of the night, which is worth points all of it's own.\n\nThere's a good story buildup, Strong interactions whenever they take place, clear dialogue, humorous tidbits, drama, excitement, despair. The writing is on point and to the letter, creating an engaging plotline that satisfies to the very end.\n\n\n--<> Gameplay <>--\n\nThis is a treat to exposition on, and one of the reasons this genre of game does so very very well, regardless of what the corporate machine might say.\n\nIt's a 2.5D game this time, sharing both old and new mechanics that span two decades worth of creative engineering with the games in question. The soul system from Aria / dawn of sorrow sees it's return as the shard system, but fleshed out, more versatile and way more engaging than it's predecessors.\n\nAria / Dawn featured an Active, Passive, Channeled (sustained) and utility type. Bloodstained features all of that, a new directional active alternate and Familiar type.\n\nLets start with the directional active. It's a fully 360 degree aimable active ability that can also be used unaimed as a quick flick. This alone adds so much more possibilities to your arsenal, it's worth giving it its own little mention. Many of the progression abilities in this game hinge on this, but it neither feels gimmicky or uselessly added. Again, bonus points here.\n\nThe rest of the gameplay is as you'd expect if you're familiar with the series. You start off as an aspiring young maiden with a pair of boots and some personal effects, yet you end as a demigod, literally flying through areas, laying waste to anything that dares oppose you.\n\nIt has the item system seen in Portrait of Ruin most comparatively, the quest design from Order of Ecclesia and the overall layout of Harmony of Dissonance / Symphony of the night. Everything feels natural despite the transition to 2.5D, every living thing in it's environment breathes atmospheric righteousness and it's clear to see what two decades of experience amounts to.\n\nThe RPG system makes a return, as has been staple since Symphony, The clock tower, library and other such classic areas have returned as well, and overall it's done exactly the way it should have been. If you are already a fan of the series, you will absolutely devour this and enjoy every second of it.\n\n\n--<> Music & Sound <>--\n\nBeing labeled famous for its grandiose musical scores, upbeat strings and memorable tunes, it should come as no surprise that this once again delivers as one would have expected, given they have resorted to the original franchise's composers yet again.\n\nI could go on about how good this is, but take this as an example, and apply it to the rest:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRAQ-ZzOE4M\n\nIt is by any standard exactly as it should be, yet does not try to copy its older iterations, creating and composing an entirely new original score that is heavily influenced by it's predecessors, yet still manages to create and introduce an entirely original and excessively satisfying audial experience.\n\nThe game's sound effects are well decided upon, well crafted, feel right at home in their environment and bring everything together.\n\nSo, F*ck yes, bonus points.\n\n\n--<> Final Verdict <>--\n\nYou may have seen this at the first line of the review, but I'm not joking or exaggerating. This is a masterpiece in it's genre. It's a game born out of love and dedication towards two decades of creative worldbuilding, a story spanning many years and culminating in getting stopped by an entity that has no business deciding that for the rest of us.\n\nIt's the piece of art labeled as ""Spite"" yet portraying the most wonderfully shaped form you could imagine.\n\nIt's everything your mom warned you about when you were little, yet in a gentlemanly form that has no malicious intent.\n\nIt's everything that's right in the world in the face of adversity and hatred.\n\nIt's Bloodstained: Ritual of the night.\n\nIt's the most Castlevania game in it's franchise, and it was created for us by a man whose dedication knows no bounds.\n\nThank you Iga. Thank you so much.\n\n\nIf you want actual numbers, \n[h1]9.9/10[/h1]\n[h1]Goodest/Very[/h1]\n\nHands down the best 34 consecutive hours I've spent on any game since Nier: Automata. This was a 100% clear normal difficulty run, and i can only imagine how much better this will get when there's a challenge in the higher difficulties. Not to mention the extra content they have planned.\n\n\n--<> Everything else <>--\n\nThe few things that deserve it's own little mention. The nitpicky and extra information you won't read anyways :D\n\nOne of the minor downsides i could touch on here is what to me felt like not enough monster density. While this makes sense in a game that has vast and epic sized areas, it does feel a little off at times, but that's purely when compared to the other games (which quite frankly pushed the hardware they were on. No seriously, expect like 10 fps if you decide to fullscreen destroy 30+ enemies on screen :P)\n\nA personal dislike was the jumpiness of some of the cutscenes, which can be overlooked and justified by creative design choice, yet felt a little out of the blue ? They worked fine in the end, but i felt that they could have done this a little smoother.\n\nGameplay and mechanics wise, i would personally have liked a few more ""off"" type weapons. Remember how the valmanway was it's own unique entity in Aria ? Remember how Heaven's sword was the be-all end-all weapon in portait of ruin? Remember that in Dawn, there was a giant laser? All these little things are here too, but they're not their own thing. While excessively unique weapons have been lacking, the variety is still amazing, but i can't help but feel that there could have been just a little more in regards to this.\n\nAnd finally, the elemental roulette that so many of these games have done in the past. This has been heavily reduced, going from upwards of 12 different elemental types and resistances to far less in Bloodstained. Wind, Poison, Curse, Stone and Slow are all here, but they lack their own subtype, whereas Order of Ecclessia had all of these in great supply. Even Circle of the Moon had more elemental subtypes and while it's clear that it wasn't entirely needed, it also meant having less of each of these, which ultimately was a slightly disappointing choice, albeit a logical one. Gone are the days where forest armors exist and Axeman armors roam the streets, yet it falls into place quite right.\n\n\n-<>This review has been written out with love and i truly hope it helps you appreciate how much enjoyment can come from a medium such as this.<>",Recommended

"This game is a love letter to the Castlevania: Symphony of the Night fans.\n\nIgarashi has proven that he, and he alone, is the reason why Symphony of the Night was so popular.  Everything he's learned over the past two decades, he put into a solid game.  He added character development, homages to his previous games, added a ton of systems to keep you replaying the game, and more DLC than most high-end studios would ever dare.\n\nThis is the greatest Metroidvania ""sequel"" to date.\n\nSo most players are going to want to know: is this better than Symphony of the Night?  That is a loaded question.   Nothing can compare to the epic introduction of SOTN.  Ritual of the Night doesn't even try to imitate it, but it makes up for interesting characters, a substantially better combat system, more customization than ever before, better graphics, and an epic soundtrack that may one day be remembered as fondly as SOTN.   After all, no game has come close to SOTN in decades.   Today, ROTN has done just that.\n\nYes, you should absolutely buy this game.  Replay value, multiplayer, and so much more make this game worthwhile.\n\n",Recommended

"Had a pretty good time playing through this game. There's a clear amount of passion and love put into this game but ultimately the clunky gameplay kept it from being great. Never really felt like anything was particularly challenging as much as I felt like I just hadn't farmed enough healing items which made most of the game feel like it was just ""Hey buy a bunch of pizzas and you win!"" The movement and combat wasn't balanced or satisfying enough for me to want to learn it when ultimately spamming the same dirt-cheap AOE fire spell over and over obliterated literally everything except the two Zangetsu fights.\n\nThe progression is also worth mentioning, as there were multiple occasions where looking up the solution is basically necessary because of how stupid the solution actually is. A particularly nasty highlight was the point I had to backtrack to an old area to pick up an armor shoved off in the corner with as far as I was aware never being hinted to do so. Additionally most of the progression items end up feeling like signle-use keys for a locked door, with the only exceptions I can think of being the double jump and invert abilities due to their universal applicability.\n\nIt's a fun game to go through once for sure, although the price is kinda questionable for how much there is. Will probably never play it again as I didn't really have a good enough time to warrant doing so, but I definitely enjoyed my playthrough more than I didn't. If you're a fan of Symphony of the Night and it's associated games you'll be a fan of this, otherwise you'll probably have just an OK time with it. I would easily recommend the de-make of this game Curse of the Moon over this if you have no prior experience with Castlevania as it was a far more enjoyable (and cheap) game for myself as a newcomer to these sorts of games.",Recommended

From being able to craft, complete quests, diversify playstyles and more. The only thing has left me desiring is the announcement of another. Koji Igarashi has done it again. The man is a legend, his team as well. To anyone else who plays this game and enjoys it. I raise a glass and hope you didn't stop after just one ending :). There are so many secrets and references, easter eggs and silly bits that are subtle enough to not rob from the immersion. The characters, lore and atmosphere are rich and the soundtrack is just simply lovely. The level designer/s are nothing short of genius. Some of the map editing done here is a visual adventure in of itself. If you are considering buying this game and wondering if it is worth the money. I can honestly say without any shred of a doubt that if I knew what was inside this golden nugget I would of paid double. Bravo and enjoy everyone.",Recommended

"Given that this was a Kickstarter title I expected Mighty No 9 again but I was very pleasantly surprised as I found this to be one of the best castlevania/metroid style titles I have ever played.  I am at 25 hours and have 100% map exploration, 100% enemies found and all three ""endings"" acquired (first ending is a short scene before a game over screen and the second has no scene before a game over screen) so I feel like it is safe to say that it is one of the longer games of it's type.  Between the five shard types (of which you can have one equipped each) and the different main weapon types, I never felt like there was a best way to play and that there were a lot of viable options.  There are quite a few bosses throughout the game, though on the negative side several of the returning bosses from curse of the moon felt disappointing and far too easy, but on the positive side some of the hidden bosses were a decent challenge.  100% exploring the map was frustrating as after beating the last boss I was at 99.5% clear and had to continuously shift+tab between my map and a 100% clear map and look for the three rooms I was missing, but that isn't really a fault against the game and just a personal gripe.  If I had to summarize the game simply I would compare it to a combination of Symphony of the Night and Aria of Sorrow in the best ways.  Definitely recommended as far as quality is concerned, but $40 may be a bit much for some people.",Recommended

If you at all like Castlevania in it's peak this game is for you.\n\nIt was made with a lower budget than SoTN and that sometimes shows.

"You start with a lousy knife and ridiclous shoes that stabbing like a joke and kicking like an idiot.\nThe game gets more interesting a bit later. \nYou absorb shards which is skills from the mosters, and craft and collect items.\nFew more hours later you may fly around the castle and casting multiple magics with like a badass.\nAnd mostly, the Music of this game is best so far. \nContents are amazing. Collecting, Farming, Exploring, those are very interesting and also much more DLC stuffs. \n\nI have not played many of old Castlevania series, many of are even before I was born.\nIt doesn't matter if you know those old Castlevania series.\nIt's a good game no matter you're a fan of castlevania or not.\n\nA girl that has ability of Shanoa mixed with Soma, Casting a magic like Challotte, running around Much bigger size than Symphony of the Night's castle, with awesome musics. \nThat's my impression of this game. \nI just hope for later series of this game, I wish I wound not need to mention for more past castlevania series for this game.\nI'd like to say is a perfect successor, and no need to mention past anymore.\n\nThere's another game that has a retro style, ""Bloodstained : Curse of the Moon"".\nI also recommend if you're a fan of the retro Castlevania series.\n\nI wish they would have more illustrations than those 3d cutscenes.",Recommended

It's Symphony of The Night, but with dress-up, cute characters (I'd say going from sweet hot half-vampire Alucard to crystal-embedded pethicc-tite-licious Miriam was quite the upgrade, and don't even get me started on Dominique, holy canolli), Aria of Sorrow soul's system, quests, crafting, dress-up...

"not pretending to do a full review having only just reached the first boss after playing around and exploring for about 30 minutes. the game plays fine but a couple things bother me. first in the opening there is missing text during the conversation. second, leveling up halts the game just to show that you are leveling up and serves no other purpose. this takes too long when we could keep the action going instead. getting shards takes too long as well but at least the forced stop is giving us details of a new ability. its only a gripe because it interrupts the flow of the game. still think it worth a play",Recommended
This game has the basilard weapon so you know it's going to be good.,Recommended
"Bloodstained is a phenomenal spiritual successor to the Metroidvania titles of the past, brought to us by many of the same talents that have created many other famous Castlevania games over the years, including Symphony of the Night. If single player is dead, no one told the team that kickstarted this game, and that is a good thing, as this is an awesome 2D action platformer that is well worth your time and money.\n\nBeautiful graphics and character design, a stunning soundtrack, great animation and movement, interesting level design, and creative puzzles round out a 10-20 hour experience for the first playthrough roughly. Controls are very tight and responsive, allowing you to perform dexterous feats and find shortcuts early, making this game a speed runners dream. Bosses are reasonably challenging, but not overly difficult if you use items and power up your character properly using the simple, well-implemented RPG elements to level up, learn new spells, and raise your stats.\n\nThere is pretty good character customization as well if you ever get tired of your look.\n\nSome small bugs that I encountered included hair disappearing partially when unequipping a helmet that covers the hair, or items that cannot be picked up that dropped in a wall, though these are infrequent, and nothing game-breaking.\n\nOverall a fantastic game, heavily encouraging replay value with new game +, extra modes, and extra characters for subsequent playthroughs.\n\n",Recommended
Bloodstained might be one my favorite Castlevania games... if only it were called Castlevania. It wholly retains that charming 1997 weirdness of SotN but improves and modernizes it.,Recommended
"Special Note/TL;DR: I am a Kickstarter Backer. $100+ tier (280CAD). Worth every penny, considering this game already feels in danger of being as good as SOTN. Which i consider one of the best games of all times and a timeless classic.\n\nOkay, i'm 20 hours into it. 36% of map unlocked. Still on normal mode. grinding, finding amazing loot, and leveling all my shards and items. i feel amazing. Discovered a neat trick to travel to a ton of areas in a way i had not considered before. Feeling bad ass. Take on a boss and annihilated and died for the very first time... ""They looks like such big strong hands don't they?""\n\nThis is on normal. after grinding. I'm loving every second of it. The economy of the game is very well balanced. Risk/reward. Anything you pursue feels rewarding. It's slow to start (as SOTN was), but once you are in it after a couple hours, it's deep and doesn't let you go.\n\nI'm a Symphony of the Night fan, it's one of my favorite games ever. But i'm no blind fanboy. Even less of Kickstarter projects. I'm cautious and paranoid of bad business practices. That said, 20 hours in... It feels like SOTN in a way no other game has (including the portable Castlevanias). It has that magic that keeps me pushing forward. So many weapons and abilities and magics, and i know i'm barely scratching the surface. So many paths to leveling and progression. Get bored of one and then your like ""Oh, there is a ton of progress in this area! I'll do that for a while"". I've gone over the tutorial level more than a DOZEN times. It still feels rewarding. How is that a thing?!\n\nA more comprehensive review to come. For now, i feel like i've barely scratched the surface. If this ""Normal Campaign"" is all there is, the game has been worth it for me. There are still unlockable characters and modes and difficulties to discover. Madness.",Recommended
"This game is exactly what I was hoping for. We haven't had a good 'vania'  (iga, metroid, whatever you wanna call it) game like this for a very very long time.\n\nThe combat is nice and fluid, the animations are absolutely fine. I mean, you don't even notice them, they're that smooth, just like they're supposed to be. There are various types of enemies throughout the game, all with their unique abilities and weaknesses, many many ways to play this game and so many different weapons and abilities for your character that I simply lost count. Said abilities (or shards) all offer a unique way to play the game, so pick the one you like the most and I'd recommend leveling that one up.\n\nThe boss fights are incredible, the sound in every room blends perfectly with the theme of said room and overall the game can take anywhere from 12 to 17 hours to complete (story wise, depending on what you're doing) if you're a casual gamer who likes to take his or her time to explore every bit that this game has to offer.\n\nUnfortunately there are a couple of bugs here and there, such as being unable to get out of the water from time to time, getting stuck sliding between a small rock and minor things like drops that you can't pîck up. None of them are effectively 'end of the world' bugs, but be sure to stop and save at every save point that you can find just to be safe. I'm not just saying that because of the bugs, I'm saying that because the next room might just kill you..\n\nOverall, this has got to be one of the best games of the year in my book. If you have the money to spare and like similar games, this is probably the game for you!",Recommended
"I didn't think the game was going to be good at all, based on the trailers, so boy am I thrilled. Lives up to the best of the Castlevania games, with modern (mostly) graphics, and gameplay. Lots of cool new features and mechanics, but it really nails the feel of the Symphony of the Night, and the GBA/DS castlevanias, which, to me, are some of the best sidescrollers ever made. Am really glad this game turned out so good.",Recommended
"When I first wrote this review I said it is not recommended on Linux.  I still wouldn't recommend it on Linux unless you're willing to bash your head against issues for the time being.\n\nThe game is really fun though so here's hoping it runs better in Proton or Wine in the future.  I will be really disappointed if they make this game unplayable via Steam Play.\n\nIf you really want to play this game in Linux don't worry fam I got you covered.  My testing has revealed two workable options:\n\n\n1) Override the default dxvk configuration settings for Proton.  This does not completely eliminate the crashing but it seems to reduce the problem.  Create a file somewhere called something like bloodstained-dxvk.conf with the following options:\n\nd3d11.maxTessFactor = 8\n#d3d11.allowMapFlagNoWait = Recommended\n#dxvk.useRawSsbo = Recommended\n\nOnly bother trying to uncomment the other two options (#) if crashing is still too frequent.  Based on the related bug report in the dxvk github people have also reported that closing your web browser can free valuable memory and reduce the chance of crashing, although the maxTessFactor seemed to make the biggest difference for me.\n\nSet your launch options for Bloodstained to be the following (using the path to your bloodstained-dxvk.conf)\n\nDXVK_CONFIG_FILE=""/path/to/bloodstained-dxvk.conf"" %command%\n\n\n2) If you are still crashing too much you can try another option.  This worked without any crashes at all but at the expense of a much reduced frame rate and increased stutter.  Maybe your video card is cooler than mine and can make up the difference.  All you have to do is disable dxvk and fall back onto the buildin wined3d implementation.  Set your launch options like so:\n\nPROTON_USE_WINED3D11=1 %command%\n\n\nGood luck fellow stubborn gamers",Recommended

"I don't mean to be a wet blanket. Seriously, I don't want to be that person at all for those who are enjoying the game. I do want to be honest. \n\nAfter purchasing the game I feel out about forty bucks. I can only imagine how some crowd funded backers feel. If this is an example of what we can expect from crowd funding in the future I have a terrible feeling in my gut about the ""success"" of crowd funded games. The overall quality of the game is fine. It runs as intended. That does not stop it from being a soulless knock off of a classic.\n\nThere is virtually no substance or original artistic character included and it shows immediately and persistently; the ""gameplay"" just feels bad. It does not feel fun.",Not Recommended
"As someone who has beaten both games, I unironically VASTLY prefer Bloodstained: Curse of the Moon to this game. It has many of the same bosses but they are implemented with meaningful mechanics in Curse of the Moon.\nIn this game I was able to beat many bosses by standing in front of them and just auto attacking while spamming a spell that spawned a shield of portraits around me. Every now and then I might need to jump or run for a few seconds, but bosses had very few mechanics and didn't feel very lethal.\nWhile there is an impressive number of spells you can use in the game, as well as pieces of armor to customize your character, I never needed to try most of said unless deemed absolutely necessary (like awful underwater sections where you propel yourself with a jet, which is your only mobility for a time).\nThere were a host of other minor issues (like items dropping in places I can't reach, items falling through the floor, getting stuck in walls after casting invert, irritating infinite sound effect bug on the last boss...), but there's nothing gamebreaking.\nIf you want a good game set in this world, Curse of the Moon is legitimately very fun (hard and rewarding), I took the time to get every achievement in it I loved it so much.\nIf you want a good metroidvania on steam, I could recommend Ori, Hollow Knight, or Touhou Luna Nights.\nBut after all this wait (I'm an original backer), it still feels unfinished and like it missed some QA / polish in some areas. They may have incorporated too many shards (spells), weapon types / armor combinations, quests, cooking, alchemy, planting ... and given themselves too much work to balance everything and make every system fun.\nBacker inclusions also absolutely destroy any immersion (constantly seeing people's pets, portraits, and presumably some of these endgame bosses like the carpenter, that dont feel like they belong in the world at all).\nWeapons can't be aimed up, down, and they don't change in the air. They just have that one hit in front of you. And some even have dead zones, like the spear can't hit targets immediately in front of you (Good luck if you're on a tiny platform) but will hit things a foot away from your front. Considering how little each weapon can do, their misgivings really stand out.\nCopy-paste quest dialogue, game is sporadic with whether or not it wants to mark npcs on your map. The gear/spell quickswap slots are nice, at least. The map is also large and at many times I wasn't clear where exactly to go next, which was enjoyable.\nI know this is rambling but again, there's no major issues, the game just feels bland. Not upsetting, but not fun. It exists, there were some good ideas, and you can see a lot of work went into it. But many tiny issues are distracting and the bosses are a massive disappointment with few and largely ignorable mechanics, as opposed to Curse of the Moon with many of the same exact bosses and feel much more rewarding to beat in that game, and even had berserk phases when they get low on hp.",Not Recommended
"Bloodstained is both Iga's love letter to his fans and a 4+ year old passion project that was funded by them. As a result, it has all of the polish you'd expect from his work; crazy yet polished mechanics, fun and interesting environments and weapons, and RPG elements manage to be simple but fun with a decent amount of depth as well. Even the story, something Iga isn't exactly known for, is really well done this time around. I won't spoil anything, but I will say that there's TONS of content packed into the game as it is, and as of this review they're planning to add even more! I'm really proud to be a backer, it was worth every damn cent.\n\nTL;DR - Bloodstained is the best Castlevania game to ever be released don't @ me.\n",Recommended

"Bloodstained is exactly what it was advertised to be and what people pledged their money for: a new metroidvania game part of that great series that started with Symphony of the Night.\n\nThe game follows the same action-RPG canvas of the series but with a few twists. Aria of Sorrow souls system is back in the form of shards, but the ability to use up to 5 different types of shards at once allows for great freedom in making your builds (not to mention the super useful ability to switch builds on the fly by making loadout presets). The weapons are grouped into 5-6 classes; all weapons within a class have the same animations, but individual weapons can have special techniques with fighting game-like input commands that can be mastered to become available for all weapons of the same class. And finally there is extensive crafting & cooking to buff your character or to make new equipment.\n\nThe castle map is sprawling and allows you to access many different areas from the very beginning. Beyond that it's classic metroidvania gameplay - explore until you can't anymore, then figure out what is needed to progress (on that note, I really like the new take on the abilities required to proceed). The game doesn't hold your hand too much in that sense as some of the solutions aren't that intuitive, but it's part of its charm; the game is filled with secret rooms - or even entire levels - that require to patiently check every wall or to have a lot of luck.\n\nIn terms of visuals, the devs made some huge progress since the betas. Thanks to improved lighting, the backgrounds now overall look luscious, colourful and stunning with a few exceptions. Sadly I can't say the same for the character animations who are either goofy or non existent, but thankfully there are very few cutscenes to watch in the entire game. Oh and the music is still Michiru Yamane, no need to add anything else.\n\nI currently have only two main issues with the gameplay: 1. normal mode is really too easy aside from a couple bosses, and 2. a NG+ is heavily needed to make use of all the late game unlocks (but this one is already confirmed to come with future updates). Other than that, I can't wait to come back to the game for the free DLCs.",Recommended
"This game is bloody awesome! if you liked the portable Castlevania games or SOTN (Symphony of the Night), you will like this one just as much. This game is pretty much on par with any of the metroidvania Castlevania games in terms of content and replayability.\n\nThere are some gripes here and there, but which game doesn't have those? im too lazy to go into detail with all the things that I like or dislike about the game. I got what I asked for, that's all what matters to me personally.\n\n9/10",Recommended

"While the game is overall good, not great, but good, feeling incomplete and rushed in numerous places combined with the visual, auditory, and gameplay glitches makes this impossible for me to recommend. \n\nStarting with gameplay, I won't go too in-depth since there's still time for patches, but some hitboxes are wonky and you can get hit by an enemy while being behind them, and the game is also prone to crashes or other bugs that render it unplayable, like at one point my screen went completely black and I had to force it to close through task manager.\n\nWhen it comes to sound there isn't too much to complain about, the music is probably the best part of the game, most of the voice acting is good and the sound effects mostly fit well. There are, however, some certain sound effects that are completely out of place and make me wonder what the developers were thinking. The most prominent examples being the walking sounds of the Wolf Man and Buer, or Craftwork not making any sound at all when it jumps and lands despite being a large boss. I also encountered several auditory glitches, especially towards the end of the game, in one case the sound effect for one of the final bosses' attacks repeated endlessly until I died, and another time the music kept playing after I'd beaten it for most of the ending cutscene. \n\nNow for the graphics, oh boy. This is somewhat of a mixed bag, because some areas like the Garden of Silence and Forbidden Underground Waterway look great, while others (Infernal Caverns, Den of Behemoths) are basically re-skins and even ignoring that fact, still look bad on their own merits. \nWhen it comes to the game in motion some parts of it look great too, in motion it can be great, but then there are other aspects of it that are absolutely awful. The character's facial animation ranges from okay to terrible, depending on the character, some of them don't even have the right colors inside their mouths. \nThe cutscenes are generally terrible, with mediocre animation, lacking effects, sometimes no sound effects at all where there should be some, and awful camera placement and movement. It's also notable that the transitions between dying and re-spawning barely exist and there is none in the boss rush mode.\nAlso, the set-pieces are generally poor and uninteresting to look at for the boss fights, and some other significant areas. The spots you fight bosses like Craftwork, Bloodless, and Gremory in are barely any different from the rest of the areas, and there's little to no build up to their fights either. On the topic of enemies, a ton of them area also re-skins of enemies you fight earlier in the game. I don't mind a few of these, but I think this game takes it too far, and some of the enemies aren't even animated properly, like chains and hair freaking out in the animations, or the tails of Lili's being completely stiff like the animators forgot to animate it, or at least give it physics instead of being completely stiff.\ntldr; Even with the improvements made from the demo, the visuals are only decent and in some places absolutely terrible.\n\nAs for the story, it's okay, but there are some problems with it. The early parts of the story like Miriam's amnesia aren't brought up at all, most of it is shown via drawings that look like they're from a book, which isn't inherently terrible but isn't able to show the characters when they're young. There are also a few plot holes, like [spoiler]how a ritual is performed to send the castle back to Hell at the end of the game in the very center of it, but the characters are outside of it the next moment with no explanation[/spoiler], and there are also poor writing choices. The prime examples being that [spoiler]so many of the important characters die when we haven't had any time to grow affectionate of them and care when they die,[/spoiler] not allowing for potential sequels with character arcs over the course of multiple games, Zangetsu being a jerk to Miriam without proper explanation, etc.\n\nOverall, while the game's not bad, it's a let down for something that raised 11 times its goal even not counting the numerous technical issues it has due to poor writing and design choices. I really wanted this game to be great, and while it's overall a good game I wouldn't rate it higher than a 7 out of 10 even ignoring the technical issues. I may re-write this later if some of the problems I mentioned are addressed in patches, but I'm pretty sure that by the end of the patches the game receives Curse of the Moon, a mini-game that was a stretch goal, will still be better than the main game the IndieGogo campaign was for, and that really saddens me. If you're looking for a truly great Metroidvania at a lower price, get Hollow Knight or AM2R instead.",Not Recommended

Why use arial? Why not use a more stylized but still readable one? \n-Borrows a little too much from Symphony of the Night. Would've liked some more original ideas. (My opinion)\n-Directional inputs for techniques is extremely annoying. I'm particularly bad at them, but I don't understand why you would keep this mechanic when a single ""special attack"" button would work fine. i.e.: Dark Souls weapon arts.\n-Johannes's feet are hilariously big\n-The textures look weird/bad in some areas\n-A few bugs (like minimap alignment during the twin tower section and giants)\n\nMy criticisms are mostly small nitpicks that personally bothered me, so the pros outweigh the cons by a large amount.\n\nOverall, VERY good Metroidvania. 8/10, maybe higher with some updates and fixes",Recommended

"Cons - It's SotN. Like, the enemies, controls map, music, everything feels like it was changed just barely enough to technically call it a different game.\n\nPros - It's SotN. They took one of the greatest games of all time and improved on it. After 20 years and countless playthroughs, it's incredible to have the feeling of playing it for the first time again.",Recommended
"Yes, its good",Recommended
"Beautiful graphics and a great metroladavnia game. Much like Hollow Knight for anyone who really enjoyed that game, which makes sense due to the fact that Hollow Knight was inspired by Igarashi. You have to use your head at parts and it's not so straight forward all the time. My advice is to think outside of the box and make sure to utilize ALL of the abilities you have, even ones you haven't had to use often or for a while. You may find yourself running around confused at points, but that's all the more fun. So far I've only played on normal and I'm about 45%+ through the map, but the demons are fair to fight. I'd say for those of you who really like challenges, feel free to up the difficulty.\n\nVoice acting is great. I prefer the Japanese version, so don't forget you can change the languages in the menu (I really recommend the Japanese voices.) Overall a very great purchase, so much so that I bought it for myself and someone else to enjoy!",Recommended
"You do not need anyone to tell you how good this game is. If you will like, it will feel right. Trust your gut. I did and it has consistently EXCEEDED my expectations. 100/10 would buy for friends.",Recommended
"Very much a Metroidvania experience. Gorgeous graphics & animations, solid soundtrack, tight controls, lots of abilities and traversal tools, several merchants/quest givers to interact with, plenty of content with discoverables and multiple difficulties. The voice acting delivers. Nice map, can scroll in/out and add/remove markers. The minimap's scalable, too. Save system works as expected, though there's a nice Suspend option that works like the PS4's sleep mode. Recognized a PS4 gamepad with no major issues (button prompts are for XBOX, but it's minor since it's all in menus). Backed it on Kickstarter, did not disappoint.",Recommended
"Wow im glad i invested in this game, closest thing you will ever get to a synthony of the night sequel, tons of weapons and spells, each enemy drops a spell and theres over a 100 enemies. Graphics are like a hd 2.5d ps2 game which i love because it feels nostalgic, give it a go if you love metroidvania type games.",Recommended

"I am thoroughly enjoying this game.\n\nHOWEVER\nThere are still some minor blips that need to be polished. On my end, it's mostly audio issues. Adjusting the audio settings kind of helps but there are short little buzzes from time to time. Maybe syncing? Not sure how to describe it.\nI don't have any big quarrels with the graphics. Sometimes there's missing text during cutscenes but it's usually just one word and there's voice acting to cover this.\n\nHaven't finished the game yet so I still have analysis to conduct. But so far, it's great, if Metroidvanias are your thing.",Recommended
"A pleasant throwback to games like Castlevania Aria of Sorrow & Order of Ecclesia. \nIf you're going to buy this, be aware that this is not a game that I can recommend for its story, but gameplay wise it's quite fun.

This is so trying to be a ""great adventure"" that even the worst Castlevania could be considered as Shakespearian in comparison.\n□  Very Bad\n\nGameplay\n☑ Very Good : It's so nice to experience this kind of metroidvania-style again, if you remember the Power of Dominance from Soma in Aria of Sorrow, this is very similar to it. Absorbing souls of your ennemies to learn their abilities, crafting weapons/armors, upgrading your souls.\n\n",Recommended

"So far I'm loving this game. Feels great, looks great, sounds great, satisfying equipment management and progression, tons of build and aesthetic opportunities, and it really feels like a proper successor to the Castlevania series. I backed it on Kickstarter, and I'm so glad to have helped contribute to this masterpiece. \n\nDon't mind the quirky bugs, like stuff being a little slow to res in or start an effect, the post-gap jump wall gibs having one spin out uncontrollably on the far left, and a few unclean lines in the edges of the minimap. Do watch out for the Eye of Horus making drops not appear when you kill enemies over half a screen-width away!",Recommended

"It's a bit buggy at the moment (not nearly BethSoft-level buggy, but it's got some issues), so maybe hold off a few weeks for some patches, but definitely get it.  If you've played Igavania games before, you know what to expect.  It's better than the DS games.  The map could use some work (why does it not center on my position automatically?).  \n\nWhen I saw video of the gameplay I thought it looked a bit sluggish, but playing it it doesn't feel sluggish.  I think it's just because of the 3D animation.  If you're not controlling it, you can't tell that it's actually quite responsive.  That was my main concern prior to playing it.",Recommended

"Ok, i will not go into detail about what the game is and its mechanics because other people did a great job at that. But instead I will list some pros and cons on gameplay and my expectations since i have previously enjoyed a couple of games made by Koji Igarashi. (Based on singleplayer playthrough, at point of this review i completed around 75% of the game)\n\nPros: \n\nClassic castlevania gameplay\nMusic is very good\nBoss fights really feel like boss fights \nCharacters: (this is a matter of taste of course) Some are a bit bland but they fulfill their purpose in the game. But most of the main characters were designed well, and do a great job at complimenting the story. I personally really like how they designed Johannes, he looks really trustworthy and loyal but on the other hand, he is an alchemist and almost too friendly, so i still don't trust him\nVoice acting is pretty good, from what i have heard, both in English and Japanese. ( i played mostly with Japanese voices) \nIn depth crafting mechanics + cooking\nThis game takes a lot of great ideas that made castlevania titles special, and put it all in this game (cooking, alchemy, lending books, optional quests, puzzles, interactions with environment)\nThe puns and hidden references (there is a lot if you know what to look for)\nThe game is quite well polished, most animations look great\nStory. For an action rpg the story is quite well written, i love the dynamic between the most important characters of the game\nScenes before boss battles are great\nOther game-modes\n8-bit hell\nAlthough the game is short, the replay value is really high with different characters and new game+\n\nCons: \n\nThe length, i like grinding materials, I did a lot of material farming and crafting/cooking. Also i spent quite some time to try and not skip any secrets, so i'm taking longer than most people. The average player will be able to finish in around 20-30 hours i would estimate.\nSome bland characters. I am not saying this is terrible, but it would have been so much better if characters like the farmer and exorcist lady had a little personal questline and backstory.\nThe village. This feels like a missed opportunity to me. It will be very rewarding to complete some requests for materials and build the town back up, attracting some more people to it, like a blacksmith or a cook. Or at least have some progression in how and when you unlock people for you village. It makes people appreciate the progress they have made i guess.\nThe game could use more diversity in items, bit of a shame with such a good crafting system (i basically have been using the same weapon for the whole game, although i upgraded it twice. Upgrades looked the same as previous versions. So this is a miss (the game also encouraged me to stick with 2-h because i was able to get the skill quite high early in the game\nTwin dragon tower. This was my least favorite area of the game, camera was feeling a bit off. And the format of this map does not work well for a 3d area.\nThe time between bosses felt really short at times. I think most people would not mind going though a few more rooms that kind of look the same, with the same enemies. Just to make the journey longer, and it will give you the feeling you are travelling from one area to another. And it is an hassle to get there. And when you do, i would always be so glad to finally see that saveroom.\nThere is a water area right next to a desert area?\n\nThe conclusion: \n\nI both had a lot of pros, but also cons. So i feel like i have to say this: the pros are things i really love about the game, the cons are more like areas the game could improve. I wonder what they are planning and how long they will keep updating and improving the game. \n\nThis game has a lot of potential, like a diamond in need of just a little more polish. As the game is now i would rate it a solid 8. \n\nwould rate +0.5 if they but some more depth to the village and villagers\nwould rate +0.5 for more item variety and mob variety, making you experiment with different weapons and shards\nwould rate +0.1 for a layered top-view map for 3d areas, and putting more distance between the water and the desert\nwould rate +0.9 for more exploration and random little secrets, making the game longer and putting more time between boss fights and a little more puzzles. The game feels light on puzzles for a castlevania title and the ones i found so far were pretty easy to solve. \n\nIn short: I think the game is great, and i hope it will become a masterpiece like some of his earlier works if the developer continues to polish this game to perfection.\n\nI normally do not write reviews, so i hope people enjoyed or found mine helpful",Recommended
"A VERY good game. If you were wanting more Castlevania, this is basically it, and it is unashamed of that fact. It does have a few bugs (item drops glitching out, occasional crashes), so I hope there's a patch soon, but overall, DEFINITELY worth the wait.",Recommended
"Was expecting to refund this game after testing it for a bit because there are a lot of metroidvania indies out there I can get for a fraction of the price and if the gameplay's gonna be more or less the same, why should I buy this?\n\nLong story short, tried it for a couple of hours, passed the 2 hour mark without realizing but didn't regret it. \n\nOne complain I have would be how I can't use my ps4 controller for this but that's not a big deal. I'm gonna get an xbox controller for this",Recommended
"I was really excited for this game but once I started playing it, animations and combat felt really clunky, it's in between good looking and weird and just feels souless. The main Character looks like a prostitute who I really never felt like playing as. Story is boring and the graphics are just odd. The music is good but it doesn't seem to interact well with the environments. Most of the times it just feels that enemies are all the same even if they look different. I remember when I used to play SOTN, sound effects would click in place with Alucard's animations; you don't get that same feeling here. Somehow the game feels barren, aiming for an intriguing art-style that just ruined the game for me.",Not Recommended

"Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night is a game in which harks back to the days of the Playstation Era, where ""Metroidvania"" or ""Igavania"" games flourished. Playing this game will trigger the nostalgic sensations that you held when you were younger, while providing a genuinely unique experience for those who have not been a part of that time. \n\nThe progression of the game is smooth (save for a point or two due to obscurity) And the crafting system (Both for equipment and skills) is something in which will have you eagerly returning to your hub to see what you can create next. \n\nThe mechanics of the skill system is interesting, and just a touch tedious- But those who do not seek to get the most out of their monster skills will have no problem enjoying what they find, and utilizing them effectively.\n\nThe story of the game is good, and it helps that the voice actors who portray their roles do so seriously. It adds depth to the characters, and makes them believable in their own way.\n\nWhile I was not hyped about this game, I can say that it satisfied my needs for it's price point, and when I return to it at a later date I'm told there will be even more I will be able to do, due to FREE DLC and extra characters.",Recommended

It's a really great and quality game that I've taken my time with and still haven't finished. \nThere are however some bugs that need fixing and there needs to be a bit more polish added all together. \n\nThis is NOT a Mighty Number 9. \nThis is just a good game with some minor problems. Would recommend if you like Symphony of the night or Aria of Sorrow.,Recommended
"A quick disclaimer; I have not played any Castlevanias beforehand, the closest comparison I have being Metroid Fusion (GBA).While this means that the mechanics of the game might be new and fresh to me, they may be repetitive for some who have been around to play those older titles. With that out of the way...\n\nThe game can be challenging at times. Bosses can sometimes feel like they're damage sponges, and the game can be stingy with healing items and save rooms. The distance between save rooms can also prove punishing for the incautious wanderer, who may lose an hour of play simply because they forgot waystones were a thing. But all these things are a difficulty thing, and mostly stem from my stubbornness about using consumables. Overall, the game feels well designed and executed, and the minor objective complaints I have lie mostly with minor bugs and the way cutscenes are framed. That aside, everything feels like it should. I'm told, that in Recommended Metroidvania fashion you can even perform sequence breaks later in the game.",Recommended
this game is awesome,Recommended
"Miriam, squeeze my hog.",Recommended
"Igarashi-san is the best at his work, I'm enjoying everything about this game. Congratulations!",Recommended
If you are a fan of the genre you owe it to yourself to buy this game. It's everything I ever wanted it to be. I really have nothing bad to say about it. Well worth the wait and I can't wait to see what all the FREE DLC has in store for us. I'm personally looking forward to the rogue like dungeon mode and seeing what it has in store for us. \n\n10/10 Excellent!,Recommended
"This game has a terrible start - But man, once you get past the introduction, this game owns bones. It's pretty much SOTN and Dawn of Sorrow but with only the good parts thrown in.\n\nStory blows - But it's castlevania level writing, so who cares? When it comes to a metroidvania, it's pretty enjoyable. Game is spot on except some skills (Shards) feel insanely overpowered while others feel worthless. Def a good buy after a love patch or two to tweak everything out.",Recommended
So for my first Metroidvania game experience i'd say this game is worth it by a long shot. I've never been the biggest fan of platforming styled games and this game I got hooked on very easily. I've been more of a open world rpg kind of guy but this game despite being sort of 2d gives me a great feeling in the rpg kind of way. So if your new to this sort of genre and want to give it a shot i'd say do it since this game has quite a bit of content and has more coming along the way in free updates. So I give this game a thumbs up.,Recommended
"If you stay still and press up for a few seconds your character will do a JOJOpose, \nAlso you can drop a stone stone mask and put it on your face while doing it. \n\n11/10\n\n\nAside from that the game is actually very good and the soundtrack is the best.",Recommended
"I didn't expect this game at first. But holy shirt! This is the modern version of the Castlevania: Aria of Sorrow(暁月の円舞曲). \n\nIt has everything the Aria of Sorrow has. Souls, abilities, a lot of useless flavour items, huge maps to explore.\n\nIt also great that landing and back dashing cancel the attack animation so I can chain the attacks. Just like Aria of Sorrow.\n\nAlthough Aria of Sorrow was great at that time, it was restricted by pathetic platform like GBA. and sequels are also bad because of the platform(Nintendo DS). Now this game is released for PC and it's really great for solid FPS and high resolutions.\n\nMy only complaint for this is that it doesn't have GNU/Linux.\n\nAlso, there are some bugs as of now. Some of the shards doesn't work at all. I confirmed that healing doesn't work. A shard that can highlight the destructible wall can be improved to rank 9 to be a passive effect, but it randamely disabled.",Recommended
"Got the game, and when I finally got to play it, I realized 16 hours have passed since I started.\n\nAll in all, this game is like a combination of all the Castlevanias you might know from the Nintendo DS times, Symphony of the Night and some touch to make it be not-Castlevania in name only. It's one of the if not the best Castlevania game on the market. Almost all the elements from Castlevania you all know and love are in the game, including certain weapons, abilities and level designs. The only con I've noticed is a somewhat linear progression, which however probably will be sequence broken regardless.\n\nBy the time I'm writing this, the game has been out for almost 50 hours. I have 23.7 hours on record. You do the math.",Recommended

I backed the game because I have been dying for a pc/console Castlevania game ever since falling in love with Symphony of the Night.  Since then, the only 'real' Castlevania games have been on handhelds.  This game solves that problem.\n\nIt looks great, it plays like classic Castlevania.  The core gameplay is there, hits the nail on the head.  Controls are perfect, tight, precise.  There are hundreds of weapons, shards, craftables, items, so many things to do and collect.  This is the Castlevania game we've been waiting for, albeit without the brand name that Konami has neglected and disrespected.\n\nRIP Castlevania.  Long live Bloodstained.",Recommended

"Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night\nby ArtPlay, DICO, Monobit, and 505 Games\nGenre: Metroidvania/Igavania\nRelease: June 18, 2019\n\n-----\n\n(Full disclosure: I backed this game during its Kickstarter campaign at the $28 level, and last year upped my funding to $100 to have access to the beta backer demo and receive the Alchemist’s Treasure physical reward.)\n\nKoji Igarashi has a long and storied pedigree of making amazing video games. The most famous games he's made have been in the Castlevania series, which task the player with exploring a massive castle, defeating many demons (and the monsters that attend them, of course) and collecting large amounts of items, including abilities required to explore areas of the castle that players had to pass up earlier.\n\nThe Castlevania series, for all intents and purposes, began as a standard linear side-scrolling series on the Nintendo Entertainment System back in 1988, with no real options in how to explore the levels beyond simple things done in a different order which don't overall change the gameplay style. These games came to be known as Classicvania. There were some early experiments in the form of Castlevania II: Simon’s Quest and Vampire Killer for the European computer system MSX, but this early in the series the changes didn't really pan out, and for the most part the Classicvania formula remained.\n\nStarting with Castlevania: Symphony of the Night back in 1997 for Sony's PlayStation, assistant director Koji Igarashi, who would come to be known as IGA, brought a new gameplay style involving the more-or-less free exploration of a massive castle and its surroundings, blocked by various barriers that one had to get abilities or items to bypass. This game and its style, together with that of Metroid for the NES (but to a greater extent Super Metroid for the Super NES) formed the basis of what would come to be known as Metroidvania, which has become a full-fledged subgenre (off the action-adventure genre) all on its own.\n\nMany games since have copied the Metroidvania formula to varying degrees of success; most of them have been indie games. Games such as Ori and the Blind Forest, Shadow Complex, Hollow Knight and others have all brought with them massive worlds to play around and explore, enemies to defeat and goals to reach. But IGA’s unique style remained crystallized in the hearts of his fans, and after the successes of the portable titles in the Castlevania series (Circle of the Moon, Harmony of Dissonance, Aria of Sorrow, Dawn of Sorrow, Portrait of Ruin and Order of Ecclesia) many people were crying out for a new installment in IGA's signature, amazing style.\n\nWell, back in 2015, IGA started a Kickstarter campaign for the funding of his new project, Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night. In one day it'd amassed over $1 million, and by the end of the campaign it had amassed over $5.5 million, becoming the second largest success in the gaming category of Kickstarter, beaten out only by Shenmue III a couple months later.\n\nThe Bloodstained campaign finally gave a name to IGA’s unique style, forming a sub-sub-genre within the subgenre of Metroidvania. The name that IGA’s company ArtPlay’s online partner Fangamer (and his eventual publisher, 505 Games) gave to this new sub-sub-genre, which distinguishes itself by having many dozens of items; colorful, mythology-based monsters; a glorious, sweeping and epic soundtrack; and many additional, hidden features that delight the player and keep them guessing: Igavania. All the previous games in the Castlevania series directed by IGA thus became known as Igavanias as well.\n\nNow, after four years of development and promotion, Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night was released on June 18, 2019! Though the development cycle, as is common for development cycles that last this long, had controversy and disappointment, especially involving the need to drop previously planned-for platforms, and logistics involving delivery of the various forms of the game near its release; the end result, I believe, is something that ArtPlay, DICO and the other developers, as well as the publisher 505 Games, can be very proud of.\n\nThe game takes place during the Industrial Revolution after the Laki eruption decimated life in Iceland, and as people were turning to technology. There was an Alchemists Guild which sought to use the eruption as a cover to bring demons into the world, to prove the worth of their existence, through the creation of Shardbinders, users of magic powered by crystal shards. This is a rather unique form of genetic engineering, and quite advanced for the time, but the created beings were meant to be sacrificed to further the aims of Alchemists Guild. One Shardbinder, Gebel, was “successfully” sacrificed, but survived, going insane and murderously furious in the process. Another, our main character, Miriam, somehow avoided the sacrifice by being in a deep sleep at the time. She was awakened at the same time that Gebel, now fully vested with the powers of crystal, summoned a massive castle in England and filled it with demons and their attendants that he summoned from Hell, in his push to take over the world and bring it under his control. Miriam now joins forces with former alchemist Johannes, nun Dominique and demon hunter Zangetsu in an attempt to bring down Gebel, destroy his castle and save the world.\n\nThe game takes many of its main gameplay cues from previous Igavania games; naturally, you have the massive castle and its environment to explore, being summarized visually in a detailed map screen which very clearly shows the areas that have yet to be explored or filled-in completely. You have the main character’s ability to back-dash, performing a quick evasive move backwards to avoid projectiles or sudden melee attacks. You have instant identification of enemies and their damage taken and given, as well as such being recorded along with much more information in the Archives off the main menu. That is the baseline of gameplay, but it only gets better from there!\n\nThe most popular gameplay element, which also figures into the story of the game, is Shardbinding, which is automatically done on a random basis (items that enhance your luck can make it occur more often) upon the defeat of enemies, or sometimes shards can be found in the world already. Ostensibly, within this universe, all enemies, demons and their attendants, that you face have been summoned to this world and bound with colored crystal, like stained glass. When they are killed, sometimes their component crystals fly out of their remains and embed themselves within our main character, adding to her (apparently benign) corruption but also enhancing her move set or giving her additional powers or enhancements. This gameplay element bears the most resemblance to souls from Aria of Sorrow and Dawn of Sorrow.\n\nAs befits the Metroidvania genre, you will eventually come up against obstacles that you won't be able to pass right away. Thus, you must go forward in a different direction, find new abilities or items and backtrack to open up the new area or find new items. This game brings back those elements so well, in IGA’s inimitable fashion.\n\nThe graphics are really great, and a definite enhancement over the beta backer demo which was available to, well, backers such as me a year ago. ArtPlay really takes advantage of the Unreal Engine to provide not just a a great looking 2.5D side scrolling game, but one which takes full advantage of the 3D element to tell the story of how absolutely massive some areas in the game are.\n\nThe voice acting in the game is all very well done by experienced voice actors from the animation medium. Erica Lindbeck, Fryda Wolff, David Hayter and many others bring the world of Bloodstained to life.\n\nAll in all, this is an amazing and a welcome return of Koji Igarashi to the world of gaming, and a very worthy spiritual successor to his Castlevania games! I would definitely recommend you check this out!",Recommended
"An unabashed love story to Castlevania from the original creator and team.

"good game, took me 26hrs \n\nthe only issues i feel like pointing out are:\n\ncharacters, they lack depth\nweapons arent that much interesting to use, you'll probably would be using only 4 to 7 in the entire game\ngrinding is kinda annoying cause there isnt too much enemy variation so it gets tedious seeing the same thing on the other side of the castle\nstages or parts of the castle could have been bigger\nsecrets aren't too secret\nitems are meh\nyou can just tank yourself on bosses\nthey got lazy on the latter part\n\nit isnt a castlevania killer, but its definitely up there.. it is still a great buy, cant wait for the dlc's, hopefully it expands the rotn lore",Recommended
It basically is Ritual of the Night 2. Only thing that sucks is that the game forces you to play on normal mode which is an absolute joke and makes your first playthrough trivial,Recommended
"I do not regret backing this on kickstarter.\nIt's not perfect, but... It is great, and I'm very much looking forward to the upcoming content.\nAdmittedly the base game is quite short, but this is coming from someone who no-lifed this for a few days.\n\nDefinitely was worth the $38 and the 5 year wait...

"Full disclosure; I am not very good at this game. That being said, I love it.\nI, like many, was in love with Symphony of the Night, and consider it to be the best Castlevania game, and I personally think it's one of the best games of all time. So the question is, is Ritual of the Night the game longtime fans have been waiting for? Yes; I believe it is. Was it worth the four year wait since its announcement? Again, yes.\nIf you're a fan of the metroidvania, I doubt you'll be disappointed by this.",Recommended

"Seems like a very janky, uglier version of the DS Castlevania games. I don't really mind the jank (things clipping into walls, bugs, generally feeling a bit unfinished) or the hideous graphics that much, so I'm having a good enough time. Your mileage may vary.",Recommended
"In short: \nExtremely good game with a few shortcomings.\n\nIn detail:\n+ graphics and performance\n+ voice acting (metal gear anyone?)\n+ insane amount of content, huge map, almost too many different weapons and skills\n\n0 decent story\n0 the typical Castlevania approach (which I may have to explain) -  some love it, some hate it.\n\nThe games (I've played most of them since the NES era) are mostly devided into two parts. The first part is for the average gamer. You mostly know where to go, you have a lot of fun and get to the 'final boss'. After beating him/her you realize that  it wasn't the 'real' final boss and only 50% of the map are explored. Then, the second part of the game begins.\n\nYou need to explore every nook and cranny of every single room and in some areas you spend more time watching walkthoughs than actually playing the game. You get to certain points where you have absolutely NO idea what you are supposed to do. I get the don't-hold-my-hand-retro feeling but sometimes it just annoys the f*** outta me. At a certain point in the game [spoiler] you need to swim under water [/spoiler] you depend on a randomly dropping item. If you don't know which enemy to farm for that you are basically stuck.\n\n- the game still has some bugs but I experienced nothing game breaking so far. I only got stuck once and used the revert function which puts you at the entrance of the last room and it wasn't a problem at all.",Recommended

"Bloodstained is like Castlevania, but with a lot of elements from the current generation of games like equipment management, crafting, and others. It's good stuff!\n\nIt's fair to start this short review up with the gameplay because that's what these games are about. There's a lot of various weapons, armor, and bloodshards (Spells) that you use throughout this game. Some of the bloodshards are required to progress into new areas. The last Castlevania game I played was Super Castlevania 4 for the SNES. So compared to that, this game has a lot going on. The gameplay loop is basically you killing enemies, then a boss, and traversing through various environments with breakable walls that can reward you with various goods. The enemies drop items could be crafting ingredients or they could give you their bloodshard (Seems to be a random chance). Since there are many weapons to choose from, you may pick a great sword while I chose the long sword for my experience in the game because it's fast, and you can get multiple hits if you're fast enough. This game has plenty of mechanics to keep you entertained for hours.\n\nThe visuals were fantastic. Plenty of different environments to keep your eyeballs from getting bored. There are plenty of new enemies and enemy variations to keep the content fresh. It has desert, forest, library, clock tower, mansion, and much much more. It's your typical Castlevania environments, but they're done really well. You won't be displeased by the visuals at all (There's also customization for your main character as well).\n\nSoundtrack was good. Each stage had a proper soundtrack to accompany it. At no point during the game it felt as though the soundtrack did not fit the stage. While the soundtrack is good, you probably won't listen to it outside of the game, but it works quite well while playing the game.\n\nSo with gameplay, visuals, and soundtrack out of the way. The last thing on the agenda is the story. It was predictable, but I was curious to see how they were going to do it. It is good enough to keep you reading, but do not expect the story to be complex. I enjoyed it even though it was simple and straightforward. Bloodstained checks all of the necessary marks to make a great game that reminds of you the great Castlevania games. It delivers on the gameplay, visuals, sound, and story exceptionally well. If you're looking for your Igavania, Castlevania, or Metroidvania fix, this game is it. You won't be disappointed.",Recommended
"Any SotN fan worth his salt  needs to play Bloodstained.  This game has that 'just one more thing' quality that keeps you playing it until you suddenly realize that it's 3am, you've been playing this whole time, and you have to work the next day.  And then you think...'So I'll just do this one more thing and then I'm going to shut it off and go to bed'....",Recommended

Even though I have nothing but praise for this game, playing this game makes me want to go back and play SoTN again.  \n\nI love all the RPG elements and just the pure action fun of trying to get through the next area.  This will be the first game I finish in the past 7 years (my oldest is 7!)  I hope the DLCs come through as I can see myself going through this multiple times like I did with SoTN.",Recommended

"This is my review as of 19 hours. I backed the game way back when. \n\nI am taking my time with this game to collect every shard, item etc and hence despite already getting the ""bad"" ending (and loading) I am not inclined to believe I am near the end of the game. If you want to herpaderp run up those stairs and hit the cloaked dude until he falls over, expect a single digit game time and a bad ending before you head off to write your negative review. \n\nSo, here goes. *deep breath*\n\nThis game is a metroidvania, or more specifically an IGAvania. It relies on platforming with RPG elements and a strong item acquisition system paired with progression blockers which require items or upgrades to bypass. \n\nThe formula remains the same from previous Igavania titles albeit with some obvious updates where required. The first one of these is how Luck works. This is a huge thing for this genre so excuse how verbose I am about it. \n\nIn previous Igavanias, having a higher luck would increase the drop rate for all items on the drop table of a creature; this when combined with the fact that only *one* item could ever drop at a time meant that you were going to get the potato with 50% drop rate consistently over that demon sword with a 2% drop. In essence you needed to have the items with % chance above the item you wanted fail to drop and THEN have the 2% chance pop.\n\nLuckily (wheey) now each item drops independently and hence draws from its own luck meaning stacking luck is no longer detrimental to farming. \n\nSmall details such as this mean that this is more than a 2019 graphical update to the formula, thought has been put into the game. The crafting system is interesting, with one time bonuses permanently added to your character the first time they eat a meal type; this saves the entire system from redundancy and means that you'll need to use it to get the most out of the game. \n\n\n\nGraphically the game is above average for a game of its type, being 2.5d and relatively well rendered. Reskinning of models is present although that is part and parcel of the genre at this point. \n\nThe voice acting, particularly that of the main character I found somewhat annoying; I found myself with the quandary of switching to Japanese and missing out on the talent of David Hayter altogether. \n\nCombat is decently fluid with appropriate animation cancelling to stuff more damage in there when it counts. Weapons are plentiful and there are lots of fun shards, swords and hammers that perform in a unique way that makes them stand out from merely being an increase in damage numbers.  \n\nI have noticed players getting stuck on certain parts of the game, in particular where to use Blood Steal and the acquisition and use of Aqua Stream. I found these quite self explanatory but of course that is entirely subjective, some may feel that it is poor game design and in this instance, it is up to the player. \n\nDifficulty-wise the game does seem to peak and drop at certain points, with some bosses being a genuine challenge and others being an absolute pushover. The game could have perhaps benefited from more play testing in this regard.\n\nI've been a fan of the Genre, and particularly that of IGA's work for a considerable amount of time, and while this may not be the decorated golden child SOTN is, it is definitely a solid, genre defining title which has built upon the trials and errors of previous games and, with the dedication of the developers, has comfortably stepped into the platform of modern gaming.   \n\nI would recommend it to anyone with an interest in RPG games, as the story, levelling, quest and item systems are deeper than a lot of other games in that genre, the game is accessible for newcomers and still has something to bite into for seasoned players.",Recommended
"Game was interesting, but very hard to play without a controller, and the first boss was almost impossible with keyboard controls.",Recommended
"Honestly, it's a love letter to every Metroid-style Castlevania game.  It liberates features from these games and acts as almost a ""Greatest Hits"" compilation of all of the magic in the exploration-progression based Castlevania games. \n\nThe progression system is deep and fun, killing demons to absorb their souls to enhance your abilities on top of regular ARPG experience points -> level up style.  Progression feels steady and re-visiting earlier areas shows a definite gain in power as the game progresses.\n\nWeapons feel varied and unique, each with a specific play-type, range, and hit box.  The difficulty is on-par with something like SOTN -- if you storm into a boss room and don't pay attention, you're going to get yourself in trouble.  By no means is this an easy game, though it is still pretty approachable.  The bosses have notable 'tells', and they have very (for them) unforgiving animation cycles.  If you dodge the attack, the odds are high you're going to get a chance to slice at them with your sword for a minute before their next attack.\n\nGraphics are fantastic -- the castle and surrounding areas are phenomenally detailed and the backgrounds make it seem like the castle goes on forever.\n\nMusic as well as top-notch -- some of Michiru Yamane's best.\n\nHonestly, this is what you hope for when you back something on Kickstarter.  Sure, it was about 2 years delayed, but now that it's out it is everything that was promised -- a proper return / love note to the exploration based Castlevania games.",Recommended

"TL;DR: 9/10 Just missing the last bit of polish for the best experience (Jun 20, 2019). If you loved Castlevania, this game takes everything good about it, cranks it up to 11 and adds a little cherry on top. You won't be disappointed.\n\nI remember a while back I saw video of a dapper man with a dream. A dream to make a Recommended spiritual successor to Castlevania because the publishers did not seem inclined. He wanted backing to make that dream come Recommended. Sadly I was in a bad place financially and could not throw my pennies at that dream. And eventually that video fell into the back of my head and was forgotten.\n\nThen one day I see an announcement. The game has been funded and is going to be realised. Sweet! However, since I wasn't a backer, I didn't follow the project particularly closely. In fact, it was just the other day that I discovered that the game was in fact getting released in just a few hours. And... well, I jumped a the chance. I bought it day 1.\n\nWhen I started up the game, I was greeted with that nice OST I had come to expect, an art style to match, and a gameplay to back it up. It felt like I was playing Dawn of Sorrow again. But bigger. Better. More developed. It's like they removed all the silly gimmicks and replaced them with much better features.\n\nI regret not having been able to back this game back in the day. However, I am glad to support this game with a day 1 purchase.\n\nWhat I liked:\n- The shard upgrading felt like a step up from Dawn of Sorrow's soul levels.\n- Passive shards when fully upgraded become permanent ability shards. This is incredibly useful.\n- Dismantling items to lesser components seemed weird at first, but I found it very helpful to save time and resources!\n- The permanent food bonus made grinding ingredients feel very rewarding. \n\nThe polish needed:\n- Some text did not match up with the VAs (rewrite?) and there were a few gaps sometimes in the spacing.\n- Loot bags getting stuck in wall/ceiling. Still collectable, but takes a while to trigger (about 10s after touch)\n- The Bunnymorphosis shard breaks the game and makes weapons redundant until late game. (Head stomp to win!)\n- Some cutscenes look like they need a little more work. Weird camera angles, odd choreography, and sound is either too quiet or seems off.\n- Some effects that are supposed to be visible on screen do not show at times. This made a certain quest a bit harder than it needed to be as it was supposed to be a hint.\n\nClosing thoughts:\nDepending on how well this game performs, I am curious as to whether this game may be the beginning of a franchise, or remain a love letter to everything good about Castlevania, it's legacy, and it's fans.",Recommended

"Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night is a crowd funded ""indie"" game that was published by 505 games and is a passion project of Koji Igarashi (one of the writers for Castlevania: Symphony of the Night). With that in mind this game does very much feel and play like SOTN or any of the other Castlevanias in the metroidvania style. It's not a carbon copy of SOTN of course, it borrows elements from some of the other Castlevania games such as the ""Shard"" system, which is similar to the Glyph system of Castlevania: Order of Ecclesia. I will admit I am biased toward metroidvanias, especially ones in the same vein as SOTN, so I don't have many bad things to say about this game. The only thing that comes to mind and it honestly didn't bother me until I spoke about it with a few other people is the art style. The art style to me borders on a sort of generic but also water painting type look. That's not to say that there aren't areas where the game looks exceptionally nice, but a lot of it looked a little uncanny valley to me. In general this game feels like a love letter Castlevania fans and even to fans of metroidvanias. I would highly recommend this game to any fans of the genre and even if you aren't I would say picking it up when it goes on sale wouldn't be a bad idea either.",Recommended

"This is a very early review, but I need to get this out there: compared to the backer demo released a year ago, the final version of Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night is a very different beast. To be more direct, the backer demo left me feeling more than underwhelmed, and worried that Bloodstained would be a bust.\n\nAfter clearing the opening area and venturing further into the castle, I cannot emphasise how much more polished this feels. There's still a degree of jank, mind you, but Bloodstained well and truly feels like the Castlevania sequel Iga always wanted to make, but never had the support from Konami to develop. I still count SOTN in my all-time favourites, and the DS titles have left strong lasting impressions for me, and this just feels RIGHT.\n\nI'll update the review as I progress further into the game, but I for one, welcome our new Igavania overlords.",Recommended
Two thumbs up!,Recommended
"To put it in simple words, since the original Castlevanias since SoTN until order of Ecclesia, I don´t think any other game has ever get close to the feeling or gameplay of Castlevania until this game came out. It makes me happy that they deliver the quality and gameplay that they promise. \n\nGameplay wise, you have lot of weapons, magic and other items to collect that change the way you approach your enemies. The game is ver versatile in this, some weapons are fast, other big and slow or medium speed (long or small for this one) . Is up to you to define which style you prefere. The magic it has 5 types, summoning, shooting, defense, familiar, and passive. There is so many options for magic that it gets a little overwhelming once you get deep into the game, but normally I focused on the same magic types so I did not bother to try them all.  Is amazing how many options are available to modify your character that it would take some time to explain it. \n\nIt has some cooking and sidequest as well, side quest are a little weak because they consist in three types, bring some item, kill the amount of monsters require and cook something. For cooking I normally don´t bother with this, but in this game, the first time you eat the dish it will give you a permanent bonus which is actually pretty good and gives you a good reason to do this.  \n\n\nFor cons, newcomers probably will find the pacing of the game to be  little rough because the game does not really tell you where you have to go next, so  you may stumble into some place that is still too hard for you or may have weak weapons or armor for that place. The same goes for the bosses, some of them are just plain super easy, and others requires you to have a lot of skill which the game does not really prepare you for that.",Recommended

"A+++ to the makers of this game. This game has everything SOTN had and more. Gameplay is much more immersive. Crafting is hella fun (I never craft in games). And you virtually have some reason to grind any mob. Even at level 39 I was grinding the entrance mobs to level up my sword passive. It's addictive and hella interesting. Difficulty is HARD. I played on normal but still suffered (as I should) on bosses and even getting through dungeons. They limit your potions so you can't just be like SOTN and heal or mist your way through. There are some real head scratchers puzzles too. Not everything is mega obvious which will have you experimenting all the time. I really really enjoyed this game. I've played nonstop for 2 days. Completed about 99.40% of the map, but still have a lot of gear, bosses, and spells I haven't explored. I think it has a lot of replayability as well. I finished going swords, may try whips or spears next run through.\n\nI finished in about 20 hours, but I just so happened to be using some OP spells and weapon combos that worked well on bosses. Otherwise I think this game is more like 25 hours. Well worth it!",Recommended
I should give this game a negative review because I broke my back trying to hold all of this quality and content.,Recommended
Truly a successor to Symphony of the Night. I'm only two hours in but it's shaping up to be one of my favorite games this year already. Makes me feel the same magic I felt playing SotN.,Recommended
"A strong follow up to the game play of Aria of Sorrow, Dawn of Sorrow, and Order of Ecclesia (I mean, it builds on all the other Castlevania games too, but especially those three). If you are a fan of Metroidvanias, you should enjoy this game.\n\nI can't wait to see where they go from here.",Recommended
It's the new Castlevania we're been hoping for for years.,Recommended
"Dude, this game is just so fun.\n\nUsing Castlevania: Aria/Dawn of Sorrow as a base while adding some elements of Symphony of the Night and channeling the difficulty of Order of Ecclesia, Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night rises above nearly half of the existing Castlevania games AT THE VERY LEAST, rivaling Aria of Sorrow and maybe tailing behind SotN and Order of Ecclesia.\n\nI normally don't write much reviews but I just had to write one for my man Iga. He and his team knocked it out of the park with one of the best Kickstarter games ever made.\n\nIf you love Metroidvanias, why didn't you already pick it up???\nIf you're interested in 2D action goodness, this game blends RPG elements with action combat marvelously.\nIf you loved Castlevania, why don't you already have this game???\n\nGET THIS GAME. Don't even need to wait for a sale, just get it. It's so good.",Recommended

Exquisite.   ;),Recommended
"Best Metroidvania since Symphony of the Night. The game is absolutely fantastic, boats an amazing soundtrack with fantastic exploration, combat, and customization. Iga did it. He said he would deliver and the madman did.",Recommended
"Excellent Game. It took me longer than expected but it was worth every penny. One thing I regret doing was skipping through the dialogue. Apparently the dialogue is helpful. If I bothered to read the dialogue, I probably would have finished the game faster.",Recommended
Pretty amazing game. Like old school castlevania with a new twist. So much fine and so much style.\n\n10/10,Recommended
"What is Bloodstained? *throws wine glass* A miserable pile of secrets! But enough talk... go buy the game.\n\nThe real SOTN experience is back, all those years looking for a decent metroidvania game and this one is perfect.\n\nThanks Igarashi, you delivered what we were expecting.",Recommended
This game is like a mix of the following:\n- Castlevania: Symphony of the Night\n- Castlevania: Aria of Sorrow\n- Castlevania: Dawn of Sorrow\n- Castlevania: Order of Ecclesia\n\nExcept it's fully-voiced and in 3-D. It does have some gameplay elements that take full advantage of being 3-D.,Recommended
I highly recommend this game. Controls are slick.\n\nI hate that the bats are super fast though unlike the usual Castlevania game. Got culture shocked on that one. Gotta get good.\n\n\nedit: oops clicked wrong thumb,Recommended

"Having beaten the game and gotten a fair chunk of completion overall, I can say with certainty that this is pretty much the not-castlevania castlevania game anyone could have hoped for. It has it's problems; strange text box bugs, mild pacing / ''where the heck do i go now?'' issues. [i'm looking at you, invert only obtainable gearpiece], lack of cosmetic slots [I just wanna have the order scarf on without sacrificing stats man] and a small handful of audio/model issues. But it feels like for each problem, there's an even better element of the game that more than makes up for it. The gameplay feels smooth and responsive, I never really felt restricted weapon wise and eventually the mobility freedom just gets intensely nutty in the best of ways. \n\nand oh man, the enemy visual and sound design.\n\nEEEEEEeeeee, OOOOOoooHHhhh\n\ni'd give it a solid 7-8/10 if i had to put a number on it. \n",Recommended

"Looking over my review, I realized I should probably actually describe the game and it's qualities, not just how much I enjoy it.\n\nDo you like Castlevania?\nNo, the good ones.\nWell then have I got the game for you!\n\nIt's off-brand (but like... technically name-brand... sorta?) Castlevania goodness!\nThere's really no better way to describe it other than, ""It's Castlevania.""",Recommended
IGAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA,Recommended
"Bloodstained: Ritual Of The Night is a macabre gothic Metroidvania that truly imburses you in its atmosphere, attention to detail and addictive gameplay. The difficulty is slightly toned down from the first game which is fitting considering unlike the first game taking heavy inspiration from Castlevania III from the switching of characters in a situation to the ball-busting, unrelenting difficulty, this new game pays homage to the modern style of gameplay from the godfathering series' later installments such as Portrait Of Ruin, Aria Of Sorrow and of course Symphony Of The Night (given the tongue-in-cheek title). This game loves to throw curveballs at the player with all original enemies with different move sets, combat positions and timing / accuracy in their movements, making even the regular rooms a fun and action-packed challenge. You collect what are called shards throughout the game much like Aria Of Sorrow, giving you multiple different moves and spells as well as perks. The inventory system is a major favourite of mine because depending on what you equip, the character's appearance changes as well. Using the side-scrolling / RPG clash of gameplay adds extra challenge with each playthrough, with a beautifully visualized location for you to traverse. Quite a lot of love was put into this game and I am glad I did not watch any gameplay, trailers or play the beta beforehand since I wanted to wait for the release to go into the game completely blind. Fantastic replayability, stunning visuals, intense boss battles and a great story among countless other things, this game truly is a bang for your buck and then some.",Recommended

"This game its amazing, has some bugs, on the UI at high resolutions. Its really god, it feels smooth :D",Recommended
"So, I dunno if having enjoyed 90s action platformers is just a prerequisite to store enough fluids in a nostalgia gland, but this is like one of the worst games I've tried in the past few years, let alone relative the positive reaction from players on Steam.\n\nI can't even see a single thing in it I'd say is done well in 1.5 hours I've played. Horrible animation, level visuals, boss fight, combat, ""level design,"" enemy design -- all just legitimately bad. Dead Cells and Hollow Knight make this game look like a joke. Just the attack animations, enemy movements, and hitboxes all feel like a student game or something.\n\nBut apparently everyone who was looking forward to it loves it I guess. I wish I could understand, because I try really hard to get why people like products that aren't for me, but I just don't get it here. The very fundamental design of the game and the actions you take to play it feel and look just awful.",Not Recommended
Do you like Symphony of the Night or the DS Castlevania games? Go buy this then!,Recommended
"The game is epic!  Huge castle to explore.  Tons of different enemies to fight including lots of tough boss fights.  lots of side quests to keep you busy.  a wide variety of items to use and collect.  A large selection of shard abilities from the mundane to absolutely useful and unique.  The biggest selling point is its REPLAY value.  13 DLC's are in the works as I type this and they will be released for FREE!  additional characters to play as, co-op and a rogue-like dungeon mode to name a few.  Above all, all this awesome in-game stuff is a modest $40.00 and that's a steal for such a large game with so much DLC's coming soon for free.",Recommended
"A bit sloppy in terms of polishing, but overall fantastic successor.",Recommended

"Fantastic game. Everything I loved about SotN, AoS, DoS, and OoE is in this game. Movement feels just like the other classic Igavanias, combat does too. It's more of what I loved in the other games, but in 2.5D and not named Castlevania. If you want more Igavania gameplay then get this game. Easily worth $40. \n\nIn the roughly 20 hours that I've played the game as of writing this review I've only run into one major bug. When swapping equipment Miriam's head didn't load. I was able to swap one piece of equipment and the game seemed to get stuck trying to force load the head and I was stuck on that screen. I had to kill the game and restart. Minor bugs I ran into: loot bags getting stuck in walls and floors, mostly from flying enemies that die in a wall or floor; getting stuck swimming on the surface of water, jumping doesn't work as if the game still thinks you're underwater, fortunately taking damage fixes this.",Recommended
"The wait was worth it!  If you love Metroidvania games, this is top notch and exactly what I would expect from the creator of the Metroidvania series.  Tons of free DLC coming, smooth gameplay, tons of secrets and unlockables!  On top of that, I GREATLY appreciate that Iga did not screw over fans by making a shady deal with Epic.",Recommended

"I am loving this game thus far and I am enjoying myself with the way looks Graphicly and as well when it comes to gameplay I can sit here with either the game music or even my own music using Spotify and just jam out like when I play Dark Souls or the Old School Castlevania games  while dropping Demons Back to back to back to back to back to back again ? I'm back again to snap again. Characters are developed well. I love who voiced Miriam (Erica Lindbeck) as well as Zangetsu (David Hayter).

"Edit: To clarify the my point.\nHard isn't the right word I guess. I meant that it's more dying for the sake of dying. The feeling of exploration and enjoyment that SotN had is just missing. It's how I feel playing From Software style games, empty and bored of pointless boss grinding that has no purpose. That is, unless you either cheese the fight or exploit the arena. Its just not fun, period.\nOriginal:\nI am so sad and disappointed. I backed this on day one and waited 4 years for it. I also grew up on Igavania games. This just isn't that... It's dark souls in 2D.  What I mean is that it is hard for sake of it. A challenge I like and losing I can do, but this beyond that. The trash mobs are fun and grindy. The art style is amazing and it looks beautiful. If your into From Software gameplay, you will love this game. What this isn't is SoTN or its like. It looks the part, but doesn't feel like it.

Masterpiece.,Recommended
"So im now updating my review on the game since i have beaten it and done most of everything there is to do on a play through.\n\n   So all and all the game is pretty enjoyable with some things that could have been done a little better.  My first review on it was not the best starting out,  after getting into the game it pulled itself back due to really nice game play and all the things you can do on the sides as your progressing through the game.  I like the idea that all the demons you kill can you give new abilites some obviously completely useless and some great.  its nice that there are quite a few weapons that you can choose from some better against certain kinds of enemies than others are which is a nice mechanic.  The game makes you think quite often because you hit spots where you know you need a kind of ability but you haven't gotten it yet so you keep running around until you can figure out where you need to go sometimes fun sometimes aggravating because there is really nothing to lead you in the right direction.  \n     \n     The story of this game is probably not the best in the world it kinda leads nowhere really and you almost feel as if there is none at times and your just kinda killing and progressing through blindly def could have done a better job there.   In my original review i mentioned cheesy voice acting i think Johannes was the biggest one for this most of the others where not too bad but Johannes was just annoying but luckily don't have to deal with him too much.  \n\n     I still dont like how precious and weak your main characters are miriam and gebel, in my book from explanation of these characters they should be these power house demons and miriam comes off as a sweet little church girl with love and peace for all, where im picturing her as a female dante, same goes for gebel wayyyyy to weak for what he supposed to be. Zangetsu is the only one that was pretty cool in this whole thing, he should have been the main over these losers.\n\n   The game is def. worth a play still cant recommend it for $35.99 still quite a bit steep for me on what you get here.  current game is worth about $20, if it came with a few dlc and some other playable characters i might push it up to $30 but even with this still not $35.99.  Wait for it to hit the bargain bin and and then pick it up its a better choice.\n\nPros\n.Graphics\n.Gameplay\n.Mechanics\n\nCons\n.Some Cheesy Characters \n.Poor Voice Over On Some Characters\n.Not the best story line\n.Current price of $35.99 10% off",Not Recommended
"I hope there is more special effect or skill for  every weapon ,now most weapons are too similar except  performance and attack speed/range， maybe  something like  3 combo attack or Dash attack??\n\nSo many bugs....  please continue to fix,\nThis is one of best game in 2019,  I love it .

"Closest thing we'll get to a Castlevania:SOTN sequel or spiritual successor that we're gonna get.\n\nSome might prefer traditional sprite visuals compared to the 3-D rendering of today, but Bloodstained manages to pull off a pretty good looking game considering the expectations everyone had.\n\nSoundtrack is okay, not too many tracks stand out from each other and quality varies.\n\nGameplay is Solid, combat is varied and offers tons of ways to combat different types of enemies in unique ways. From Swords to guns to whips, magic attacks, transformations etc.\n\nOverall its a fantastic game that brought me back into the MetroidVania genre.",Recommended

This'll unlock Hard and Nightmare difficulty. I recommend playing Hard if you want the challenge. \n\nThe combat is smooth, and very open-ended. The characters are well designed, and very well voiced (they've got a high level cast to work with).

The shard system is a 1 to 1 clone of it, also bringing in the leveling up of spirits (AKA shards) from Dawn of Sorrow. It's a perfect mix of both the games in my opinion, it even has the fast movement options from both too!

A worthy follow up to SOTN. They just don't make them like this anymore. It shows in all the small details of the castle. The large amount of gear and equipment.

"Updated review posted 6/24\n\nI backed this game on Kickstarter.  \n\nThere were no bugs or technical problems with the game aside from two very rare cases where I got stuck and had to take damage or use an item to warp to town.  At my current playtime of 30 hours I have killed the final boss and collected roughly 75% of the different stuff in the game.\n\nMy feelings about Bloodstained have not changed upon completing the game.  It's the best classic styled metroidvania title we've had in years.\n\nKoji Igarashi has made what I would consider a 'greatest hits' style game with Bloodstained.  Takes the unique mechanics from many of his previous Castlevania games and blends them together into one cohesive package that is a pleasure to play.  If you've enjoyed any of Iga's previous titles on the DS or GBA, I recommend this game.  \n\nI did find Bloodstained to be a on the easy side overall, but I was over leveled with a very good equipment loadout.  The optional bosses proved to be more of a challenge.\n\nI am looking forward to returning to the game on a harder difficulty level, as well as to play the various announced DLC modes.\n\n\nOld Preliminary Review\n===============\nAt 5 hours in, I am willing to give Bloodstained a preliminary recommendation. I have fully enjoyed the time I have spent so far. I will update this review later if the game radically changes somehow or once I have finished the game.\n\nIf you enjoyed Symphony of the Night, or any of the “DS-vania” games (Order of Ecclesia, Dawn of Sorrow, etc) you will probably enjoy Bloodstained as well.  I would encourage you to check out live gameplay before spending money on any game.\n\nThis one really is Castlevania in all but name.  It’s got a very large labyrinthine level to explore with plenty of secrets. Combat is simple and fun with tons of different options.  \n\nIt definitely seems like Bloodstained has all the aspects of a great Metroidvania.",Recommended

"I give this masterpiece 100/10, but that's not important. \n\nHere's what is important: the game is a relatively small download at 8.3 gb. You have a 2 hour refund window. I promise that in under 2 hours you will experience more than enough of this game to make a decision about whether  it is for you and worth the asking price. If you have even the slightest interest, give it a try.",Recommended

"I have played a lot of Castlevania games from Symphony of the Night to Order of Ecclesia, even the Lord of Shadow ones. From my current first impression and gameplay experience, Bloodstained is a Castlevania in every way except by name alone. The combat is classic side scrolling goth fun that is all too familiar from the latest Iga Castlevania games. The map exploration, hidden paths, breakable walls, and the classic Iga style save areas are a warm return. The playable characters are relate-able to past Castlevania heroines like Soma Cruz (Miriam),and  Zangetsu(Julius Belmont), and to Miriam design, her outfit and color scheme is reminiscent of Shanoa from Order of Ecclesia as well. Thank you for being loyal to the metrovania fans and genre Iga, your work and dedication to creating Bloodstained is greatly appreciated.\n\n",Recommended
"Amazing game so far. It feels like the golden era of GBA/DS Castlevania games. The game feels like a mixture of Symphony of the Night combined with Aria of Sorrow. Great music and sound, the graphics are very well done, gameplay is solid, controls are tight, large variety of weapons and spells/effects/summons. \n\nIf you enjoyed Castlevania then this is 100% the game for you.",Recommended
"If you where waiting on that Castlevania type itch. I say that this game is pretty dam good on scratching that itch. Has good music and what i so far played, been enjoying the heck out of it. Has the same feel of the vania games and so far haven't encountered any bugs other than some mispelling in dialog chats sometimes. Nothing that a small patch would fix. I would recommend this to anyone that enjoys the castlevania or medtroidvania type games.",Recommended
"I was going to write a long, in-depth review but I think at this point the game's reputation and pedigree speaks for itself.\n\nThis is a masterpiece and sets a new bar for the genre along with being a love letter to its past. If you've ever enjoyed an Iga/Metroidvania style game, you owe it to yourself to play Bloodstained.\n\nFar exceeded all expectations. You can feel the passion that went into crafting it on every screen.",Recommended
Absolutely fantastic. If you love Castlevania buy this.,Recommended
"My review is going to be a little biased due to my love of Igavania games.  This game is Not Symphony of the Night. It is Not Aria or Dawn of Sorrow. It is not Order of Ecclesia or Portrait of Ruin.  It is the best part of all of these games combined. \n     You like the familiars from symphony of the night?  They got it.  \n     You love the soul system from aria and dawn of sorrow?  Its in there.\n     You like the transformations and quests from order of ecclesia?  They got that as well.  \n     You like the weapon skill system of portrait of ruin?  Guess what?  It's in here as well. \nThis, is the BEST metroidvania I have ever played, with the best systems of all of the igavania castlevania games. Best part?  Its not too easy or too hard. It has great balance! The weapons, actually feel different and not just, a small difference of name and power. I highly recommend this game, and am buying it again on my switch once I get the money!",Recommended
"Bloodstained or as I like to call it\nits like Im really playing some unholy bastardization of igavania and character action game with a little fighting game mixed in. Just exactly what I wanted.\n\n\nI dont like it.\n\n\nI dont like the boss fights, I dont like the fucking inputs that dont read properly half the fucking time and I dont like how fucking stingy it is with healing items.\n\ntbh I gave it money because I got caught up in the fuck konami sentiment but man I wish I had that money back right now\n\n\nmy favorite thing so far to show off how the inputs dont work the shoes have an input that's literally a hadoken quarter circle x sometimes it'll do the thing, most times it wont. The BEST one is the katana block, which will somtimes trigger when you're just trying to move and get you hit.\n\nthe hit box is also super fucking off and seems to be the size of a semi for the player but nobody else\n\n\nthe second boss is an utterly infuriating  example because the range of his attacks fucking SUCTION to you, you can get damaged by him when return to neutral from your own attack because you cant move during those animations but you hitbox is ON during those frames so you're fucked, and, and, aaaand the best fucking part. Your back step has no invincibility frames so even if you clear his attack if the little tiniest pixel on the edge of it hits your model you take a shit ton of damage and get knocked back and stunned for enough seconds that he can close and hit you again\n\n\n10/10 would refund again. Wish I could unkickstart it too but I'm stuck with that version until I can flip it on ebay, then maybe some value will come out of this experience.",Not Recommended
Literally Castlvania and literally fucking amazing.\n\nedit: Absolutely worth the wait. Way more content than I even imagined. It's rare a kickstarter game not only lives up to the expectations but goes above and beyond those expectations. Few minor bugs aside this might be one of the best metroidvania games I've played. Must own if you're a fan of the genre. I would have easily paid $60.,Recommended

"It is very much what you probably think it is. Castlevania  and very much symphony of the night.  I do give it a recommendation, However it does have a few failings I feel need to be mentioned. If it not mentioned it a ten out of ten for me.\n\nNormal mode is a joke.  It shows three difficulty modes starting with normal, but really it should be called easy and hard should be open from the start. I got VERY bored VERY fast by about 40% map completion. Nothing was worth my time. One boss I literally killed with one fire pillar spell <...<.  This is a huge issue for me cause my first play thru I want to super explore and test out shards and weapons. But the game is such a joke combat wise instead of wanting to see what monster had what drops or what builds I could try or exploring the crafting system. I just kept thinking it isn't worth my time. I can't even imagine how easy this would be if you actually grinded shards or materials out. Sooo This is kinda a huge issue for me as I was really going full brain dead during this. \n\nIn the same vein as my last post I kinda felt gear pacing was also really strange. I can't say for sure on weapons as again too easy I just never stopped using flame whip cause I just could not be asked with the level of challenge. But I noticed as I got further I felt I got lesser drops from the greater enemies. Example being. Base Demon drops a passive straight up INT boost if you want to use spells this is great. Arch Demon much later drops one that just lowers MP costs... but at that point I had an accessory that did that. 600 MP and a screen nuke that cost base 30mp down to 24 with the accessory and that shard was just  pointless compared to the one gotten from its earlier form. This is kinda a theme as you continue on. I feel like they dropped the fun creative stuff early on and sorta phoned it in for the mid-late game items. \n\nI did have a great time with the game. I will probably play thru again on Hard just to hopefully get more out of it and actually have a reason to experiment this time around.  I think this game is a STEAL at its current 48CAD and only 36 USD.",Recommended

"I preordred this game.  Since day one of its release I've been unable to progress passed this first room of the Galleon.  THE VERY FIRST ROOM!  Once I would complete the ""tutorial"" the game would freeze upon leaving that room... every time.  I logged 3hrs in the game doing the same thing over and over.  Adjusting settings.  I've installed and uninstalled the game multiple times.  Did everything that I could think of and suggestions I read from other players in the discussion board and nothing changed.  ""Tutorial"" finished, try to exit the room, freeze with black screen but could still hear the sounds of the Galleon creaking.  A week and a half and not one patch, post of an update, and when I would reach out via social media looking for some help... crickets.  So I've refunded the game.  I hated to do it cause I was looking forward to actually playing.  But apparently only the consoles seem to matter, cause Bloodstained's twitter only posts updates about the consoles and act is if the PC side of the game is running great.  Well its a farce.  I don't recommend this game as it is.  Give it a year.... wait till next years Summer Sale.  Maybe it'll be worth picking up then.  So disappointed in this game... and the developers",Not Recommended
SOTN's major flaw was it didn't mix up the enemy types enough in unique ways.\n\nROTN fixes that.\n\nOnly problem is it's too easy and becomes boring. Do yourself a favor and call your save file NIGHTMARE to start on Hard or Nightmare mode. If you've played literally any other metroidvania before then easy will ruin the game for you.,Recommended

"I'm only about 5 hours in, but this game is an absolute delight to play. The story is a bit floaty and abstract at times, but falls perfectly in line with what you should expect from an Iga-vania game. The world is dense with beautifully designed demons and creatures, and the castle is intricately designed. Character movement and combat feels very satisfying. If you have ever considered yourself a fan of the Castlvania series , and particularly Symphony of the Night, then this game is a must play. And even if you never have played a Castlevania game, but are a fan of 2d action platformers (and 2d RPGs), then give this game a look.

Some japanese guy with a glass of wine sold this game to me. Guess it was written. Have at me.,Recommended
"The developers listened to the mixed community feedback and massively improved on the art direction before releasing it, which is commendable.\n\nFrom gameplay perspective this is a carbon copy 'Castlevania: Symphony of the Night'. You explore a vast nonlinear 2d world with hidden secrets and a ton of items (found 5 weapons in the first 15 min). Each enemy has a completely different movement/attack pattern so you need to study them and react accordingly to survive. There's a big arsenal of weapons, spells and attack combos to choose from. The weapons aren't just simple stat upgrades, each one 'feels' different.\n\nThe dialogue/story might be interesting for a few people used to anime tropes, but for most people a strong cringe attack will take over after listening a bit.\n\nAs a big 'Symphony of the Night' fan this game was a must buy for me, but it is kinda hard to wholeheartedly recommend this to everyone since many of the combat and item mechanics seem pretty old school by today's standards. Just give it a try - play it for one or two hours and simply refund if it's not your cup of tea.",Recommended
"With the bookshelf fatal errors issue and hard freezes I just can't recommend this game right now. It is a decent game but even without the errors it feels clunky, dated and unpolished  compared to something like Hollow Knight which if your looking to play this type of game and havn't played yet I'd highly recommend over this. Not to mention the difficulty is laughably easy with no option to pick a harder difficulty until completing the game\n\nTL:DR just buy Hollow Knight instead.

"Short Version: Feels like Aria of Sorrow if Soma was super hot British girl.\n\nLong Version: You can tell this game was made with an extreme amount of love. Every aspect of it is beautiful. The gameplay is smooth and fun, the voice acting is superb, the characters are lively and the amount of little details is mind blowing. You can customize your appearance which is really nice because you can make yourself look the way you prefer and are not stuck with just one look. There are several powers you can get that are very fun to use, some of which even make you look like the monsters, which is very cool. This is definitely the Metroidvania that we've been craving for years and it is so satisfying to blaze through the demon filled castle and just mow through all the monsters in there.\n\nAs a kickstarter backer I feel as if my $60 and at least 3 year long wait has more than paid off.",Recommended

"y'know, after all these years, iga's still got it\n\n[h1]THE GOODS[/h1]\n\nweapons are varied\n\nsame feel you've come to expect from older iga titles, but works off of the charisma that order of ecclesia had going for it\n\nabsolutely huge castle with tons to explore\n\nthe controls, while in places stiffer than in other metroidvanias, have a logic to them that isn't bad which expects your mastery\n\nthis isn't like SOTN where you can facetank half the bosses to death because they just happened to make cool designs and didn't really think about how alucard would interact with them, this is working off of boss design principles refined throughout the DSvania trilogy\n\ncrafting system really doesn't get in the way and rewards you for existing generally; you still find a lot of goodies in the walls like any good metroidvania game\n\nalso, generally, after you've crafted something like a food item once, you can just like, buy more\n\nmost money comes from chests around the castle in bursts, but you can also make it from selling shards you're never going to use, or ambiently collecting tiny amounts from light sources (this means that if you're not wise with your resources, you have to do without)\n\nexploration is a really strong point, and revisiting areas of a castle for the serial nature of experiencing the areas again has never been quite so strong\n\ni'm a big fan of zangetsu because of doing solo runs as him in curse of the moon, so i'm hype for zangetsu mode\n\ni can see really enjoying this on the higher difficulties, especially after playing normal, particularly for the serial nature of some of the areas; nightmare seems hard enough to justify NG+ing onto it even, but mileage may vary\n\nvariety of elemental environments and length to the equip system really makes me want to play again on a higher difficulty just so i can get some actual mileage out of everything (particularly nightmare because that might be just want i wanted out of a metroidvania)\n\n[h1]THE neutral[/h1]\n\nthe bosses can get teeth-grittingly difficult if you don't decide to really specialize your moveset, and even then...!\n\nsome things in the game either expect you to get lost more or don't know their place (looking at you, quest and crafting requirements)\n\nto elaborate on what i mean by that, sometimes the crafting materials for things aren't things you'd have on hand, so if you really want something for a damage type build or armor, you might have to do some specific hunting, not that that's unfun or anything, i'm just incredibly impatient with my games these days so i don't do that\n\nalso, the common crafting materials are in the respawning blue chests in various areas, so if you end up doing any backtracking (and it's a metroidvania game so you're gonna do some) you can pick 'em up almost instinctually as you see a chest and go ""ooo chest"" and proceed to inhale its contents\n\nsome bugs, game might seem like it lacks polish at times\n\n[h1]THE BAD[/h1]\n\n- sometimes the boss design doesn't feel fair, even on normal; some things just feel like you have no intelligent way of dodging without using cheesy shards that let you tank\n\nit feels kind of a step down from the sorrow series, OoE and portrait of ruin, where a lot of fights you could very conceivably do for ten minutes with level 1 crook loot and still win because you could avoid being hit\n\nprovided, in every metroidvania/igavania, you can just get pinged by the mooks because they were always a little more erratic than the bosses\n\nhere, the 3D models of the enemies make hitboxes a nightmare to reason with, and you're gonna want to use polearms if you don't want to take a lot of clumsy contact damage\n\n- tries too hard to follow some of the same beats of sotn, which is somewhat the point for nostalgia's sake, but in doing this it copies some of sotn's esoteria behind its puzzles too; not the worst thing ever honestly but yeah\n\n- doesn't [i]quite[/i] give the same thematic punch as dracula and movie monsters, and in that sense i wish the game crossed over into eastern mythology more to capitalize on a different kind of, shall we say, thematic reverence\n\nat the same time, it did a really good job establishing its own uniqueness and retaining european roots with a little cool japanese stuff mixed in\n\n- if you like the classicvanias for their unique feels, you might dislike even the suggestion of grinding here; you can beat it on normal pretty much without grinding, bu~t you might feel the want to grind for cool items in some places, and it's always available\n\noverall the pacing on levelling up and gear might put you off from experiencing areas again; after all, the challenge in them has passed and you don't wanna kinda just mill about in them\n\n...if you play on NIGHTMARE, you're capped at level 1, so that's not so much a problem. enter NIGHTMARE in all caps in file select to uncap the difficulty if you're certain you're an epic pro gamer (you can rename it later too!)\n\n- the boss thematic design is a step down from Curse of the Moon, where even the midst bosses were painted as grandiose, here they're just kind of... here. like, the heck happened to electric peacock man? why's he just essentially shard fodder in some unremarkable room? i get SoTN had some moments like this, but dang...\n\n- stop making me SWITCH TO THE REFLECTOR RAY FREAKIN'\n\n- or, rather, i always hate when metroidvanias make you seriously dig through your inventory, it's annoying\n\n- boss HP should be a skill shard instead of an equip tbh (not that they're a metroidvania staple, but they help the pace of fights a lot i feel, particularly in this game specifically)\n\n[h1]addressing common criticisms others have of the game[/h1]\n\n[b]voice acting and horror game-related opinions[/b]\n\nif there's any campyness left in the voice acting, i'm gonna attribute that to wanting to retain some cheesy qualities (which after all sotn got by on); they definitely wanted to build their own charisma and character with this game, and some of that goes against what people consider objective quality for a game\n\nmyself, i never notice things like voice acting, but i actually feel like a lot of the main voice acting of this game is at least refined, and while some bosses can be cheesy, like... that's the point, igavania titles have never been hard silent hill horror, they've been an exploration of fear elements in game design, meanwhile the theme has typically been vaguely cheesy\n\nthis hearkens back to the NES era where simon had it hardest; the delay on his whip was to instate solid, clear rules to the player (who is otherwise mistaken that the controls aren't quite thought out) and also put tension into fighting monsters\n\nhits had to count, you had to know how to position yourself, etc.\n\nof course, this doesn't always lend itself well in the NES eras, but this shows the strongest in the PC Engine [i]Rondo of Blood[/i]\n\nthe bosses aren't out to scare you by being dark or gorey (although some are gorey!), they're out to scare you by being what they are and then kicking the shehehe out of you\n\nso, in essence, the game tries harder to be ""cool nineties video game"" with hints of the OoE personality than it does silent hill\n\n[b] graphics [/b]\n\nwell-optimized, very pretty, and honestly, i love 'em\n\nwhile nothing can run at native res (1920x1080) on my level 5 archcrook computer, one size down suits this game just fine\n\nas always, you can whack vsync and some shadows and effects and the game will run just fine most of the time\n\ndetail in areas varies, which can also effect low-tier PC performance, but in boss encounters and high combat they generally know when to leave it alone and let you try not to die\n\ni don't really get what people still complaining about the visuals are expecting at this point, i feel like, even if one is unimpressed, it's both a 2D-centric title, and it's not really supposed to be a blockbuster in terms of graphics, it's supposed to be a good game",Recommended

Bloodstained Ritual of the Night has the contemporary touchings to attract the modern gamer, with the sleek visuals and the obligatory crafting system.

"All the great elements of a classic Castlevania topped off by superior voice acting, smart level design and a robust customization system for spells, weapons and equipment.\n\nSo proud to have been a backer of this so long ago. My only regret is not having more money to win some of the really cool backer perks offered by this incredible team of artists.\n\nStop reading reviews, go throw your money at the screen and enjoy the fun challenges to be had in this fresh new Igavania.",Recommended
The last possible temptation I might have had for ever buying another game from Konami is now gone forever.,Recommended
"A few minor bugs, but I expect those are going to be patched out in short order.\n\nGreat visuals and sound design. It feels like a 90's game, with modern design sensibilities.",Recommended
"""And when Igarashi saw the breadth of his domain, he wept for there were no more worlds to conquer.""\n\nThis game is, simply put, a masterpiece.

Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night\n\nWill update once played throuhg fully but initial impression is GOTY 2019 worthy.,Recommended
"hello this is probably my first review of a game on steam, so i might say some incorrect things, but i want to give my honest opinion of the game, i have seen the negative reviews and they have some valid points, the backers the most since they were expecting a perfect product, first of all i have never played a castlevania game my only experience from before was this metroidvania game hollow knight, and i gotta say bloodstained is very good i saw some people say its boring but for people who like rpgs you can improve your spells, craft, quest, explore, level up, and there are a ton of secrets hidden, on top of that while you explore you hear this amazing soundtrack its a blend of goth rock with violin and orchestra , you can change your appearance, and its hard at least for me, it feels very rewarding to explore every nook and cranny to find a rare greatsword with a unique ability, there are many weapons you can choose from and the game gives you freedom to choose your playstyle, for example, in my case i focus on greatswords and defensive spells kind of like a holy knight of sorts, but you can be a summoner you can equip some spells which summon demons, or you can use pistols and fire spells there are no limits to customization etc, and one of the things that surprised me were the familiars, there are some crystals that allow you to summon companions and they follow you all over the place and you can even improve them and they level up fighting, this is a very unique game, of course there are some bugs but nothing too bad at least for me i only have 6 hours of experience to this game, so take my review with a grain of salt for those who are thinking of buying this game i say please do, you wont regret it, im sure those bugs everyone is complaining about will be fixed. another thing i tought this game had multiplayer i guess they might add that later :)",Recommended
"This game is a love letter to Symphony of the Night. There are so many things you recognize when playing through Bloodstained. But, not only does it resemble SOTN, but it has improved on it (IMO) in some areas. The equipment shortcut, for example, makes the game feel so much better to play. I don't have to go through a menu every time I want to change weapons or such. However, even if you haven't played SOTN (which you should, seriously go play it) you will enjoy this game. It, simply, is a joy to play.",Recommended
"With 12 hours in, I can wholeheartedly agree: This is what us, Kickstarter Backers were hoping for. Iga promised, and delivered (albeit with some drastic delays) an amazing METROIDVANIA experience that we were so desperately craving for. The game feels right at home with the 2.5D Graphics, and the experience is just as if you were firing up that Castlevania classic for the first time. No abusive amount of hand holding in the matter of tips, and just the right seasoning of elements from other games, with nods to the old franchise, and a good numer of easter eggs to keep you interested in what's hiding behind those secret walls. The resolutions and other graphics details sure can get a better polish, but so far, only minor problems have been encountered. The mechanics are classic, but with a good touch of fresh elements to keep it interesting, like ammunition quantities and different types.\n\nIn short: If you love Castlevania, and miss those good old days where Konami didn't suck (too much). GRAB THIS GAME.\n\nFrom a dedicated fan, to a love letter to the comunity that is this game. <3",Recommended

"If you liked SotN, you'll be in heaven here. It's actually crazy how similar the two are. Castlevania: Ritual of the Night is probably one of the best modern Metroidvanias second only to Hollow Knight.\n\nAmazing visuals, music, and fun gameplay. Iga outdid himself. Cheers.",Recommended
"So far, it's a good game. There are a few bugs where the hints explaining abilities on my pc just disappear randomly, but it could be worse. Fun to play. Great musical score. I wish that you could move more quickly at first, but I'm betting that changes as you gain more abilities or unlock other characters. I'm only a little bit in (under an hour), so these are strictly early impressions.",Recommended
"if you are a nostalgic of castlevania:SOTN, then be sad no more. This game is here to put back a smile on your face. Almost everything you liked about SOTN, you will get here.\n\n Be warned that it is extremly similar. so don't complain that 'it looks to much alike'. Also, the game has some minor issues and bugs. But nothing too great that you cannot enjoy it for what it is.\n\n Hope we get some more from the creator!",Recommended
"Playing with about 30% completed. This game is brilliant.\nEspecially more that its a crowdfunded game despite recent news of other crowdfunded projects.\nIt places near the likes of SotN but falls short due to a few design flaws.\n\nPros:\n- Graphically vibrant, atmospheric and distinct\n- Solid, responsive controls\n- Runs smoothly even on low end PCs\n- Igvania is back with additions like crafting\n\nCons:\n- Crafting is held back by very low material drop rates which means grinding\n- Managing shards is a bit cumbersome\n- Hard to judge hitboxes accurately in 2.5D",Recommended
"""What do you do when you find yourself without a castle?\n\nYou build another.""\n\nIga did. And it SHOWS. This is Castlevania at its finest, and also improved and expanded. If you enjoyed Castlevania: Symphony of the Night / Harmony of Dissonance / Circle of the Moon / Aria of Sorrow / Dawn of Sorrow / Portrait of Ruin / Order of Ecclesia, you will LOVE this game.\n\nNot much to say. Back this. Buy this. Show Konami what they've lost.",Recommended
"Great level design, movement, and combat mechanics. Graphics and Animations can sometimes be meh but the core experience itself is is amazing.",Recommended
"I really want to love this game. SOTN is my favorite game of all time. The brief time I was able to play this it was amazing but first despite multiple troubleshooting measures my controller either refuses to be detected by the game and after forcing detection it cuts out (last time during a boss fight) and it will not reingage. I have tried using multiple controllers, both wired and wireless Xbox one and PS4.  I'm going to try the switch pro controller next. This is a game breaking bug as this is one game I really prefer not to use kbm. If this is fixed I will change my rating. As of now I'm contemplating refunding it despite waiting on the edge of my seat for years for this game.",Not Recommended

"Castlevania lives again!\n\nBloodstained is the Castlevania game fans have been dreaming of for years, even though Konami decided that players ""don't like this style of game anymore"". Gotta love corporate marketing. :p\n\nThis game us Recommended to its roots. Everything from the super slick combat, the wide array of platforming puzzles, the varied enemies and the huge gear list feels just like the Castlevania games of old. The graphics and music are simply perfect. This game is Castlevania in everything but name. A definite must have for fans of the series, or those who enjoy a good Metroidvania style game.",Recommended
"It's an excellent example of a SotN-style game. Combat is fluid and entertaining, environments are well constructed, enemies are varied, and the music is excellent. There's plenty for a completionist to do - ranking up and grading up shards, practicing weapon techniques, undertaking quests, crafting, cooking, levelling familiars, finding hidden stuff. If you want to max out everything, you'll be at it for a while. None of that is necessary for a run of the game, so don't worry if you're not the grinding type.\n\nThe story is about a bunch of lunatics going on a kill vacation in monster castle, also there's a samurai. And crystals. In other words, pretty much ideal for this sort of game.\n\nI wouldn't skip this if you're a fan of the genre, it's pretty much exactly what was promised.",Recommended
"Game play is long and painful. The boss is hard and killing ordinary enemies gives you almost nothing. You have to spend a lot of time killing similar enemies again and again to get pass the first boss.\nAlso, the graphics is bad while the game is a bit laggy. The appearance of monsters are ugly and random. \nSome players recommend this game because the main character is pretty. The game is not good except from that.",Not Recommended
"What are you doing? You should be playing this game. The visuals, music, and overall aesthetics are beyond brilliant. If you're a fan of Castlevania then this should be a no brainer. Get and play this absolutely amazing game!",Recommended
"So Symphony of the Night, it hurts. This game takes every innovation from the Castlevania games, GameBoy, DS, or console, and blends them into a package that is so like the original as to give one shudders down the spine. It's great. The soul collecting mechanism of the GBA games, the huge castle to explore of Symphony, and they've even added crafting and cooking, with some tweaks to make the items needed for these things easier to get and effectively infinite. You can now carry a ton of healing items with you. This makes the game easier, but there are two harder modes if needed.\n\nThe music, dialog, and character design all harken back to Symphony. Even the dialog is cheesy and uses some of the same voice actors as Symphony. I think some people kinda missed this fact, as I see people commenting that the story and dialog suck. I mean, that's the point! Complaining about this is like complaining that the story in a Metal Gear game is crazy: that's the whole point!\n\n10/10, great. Scratches the Metroidvania itch.",Recommended
"I'm just about five hours into this game, and all I can say is that Iga has done a fine job with this game, and shame on Konami for letting their ""diamond in the rough"" get away! Actually, shame on Konami for several of their business decisions over the past six years, but that's beside the point, let me cut to the chase about this game!\n\nIf you're a fan of the ""Metroidvania"" games, like Symphony of the Night and Dawn of Sorrow, then this is absolutely the game for you!  The Shard System is essentially a copy of the Souls System from Dawn of Sorrow, where you can get higher grades of powers by collecting multiple shards. The weapons are both easy to learn and innovative to use, which is good, since different enemies will require different setups to take on at times. The voice acting is marvelous, and the music is a fond callback to the Castlevania series as a whole.\n\nBe prepared to strike plenty of walls for all those secrets, by the way!",Recommended
"Haven’t finished the game yet, but I just have to say this game is utterly fantastic. It combines some of the best parts of various castlevania games (I’m seeing a lot of simmilarities to aria of sorrow) to make an experience that feels like a fun return to form. Also, I can’t help but smile when a game is everything that we were promised it  would be.\n\nI’ve had some crashes at inopportune times, but save points are prevalent enough that it hasn’t caused me too much grief, and I’m sure stability will improve over time with patches.\n\nOverall, if you love the Metroidvania genre, you’ll feel right at home with this game",Recommended

"Best metroidvania game since SoTN in my opinion. Seriously impressed so far, I've had so much fun with it. Sure there are a few bugs here and there but nothing gamebreaking. My biggest problem with the game is that there is no 3440 x 1440 support, and the screen stretching is annoying (you have to play at 2560 x 1440 with black bars on the side of the screen). Other than that it's great. There are a ton of unique weapons, enemies are varied and inventive, bosses so far are awesome, soundtrack is OUTSTANDING, the shard abilities are fun to use and there are quite a few of them so far, and I'm only a few hours into the game... and DAVID HAYTER. People will find anything to whine and cry about these days, because we live in a society that's obsessed with picking things apart, criticizing them and focusing on the negatives (no matter how small they are). However, if you're a fan of Castlevania (and you don't have a sandy vag) then you'll enjoy this game.",Recommended

Whoa. It's like I'm playing Symphony of the Night all over again. \n\nWith way too many NPCs--like the later DS Castlevania games--but whatever. \nYou can handily skip that noise.,Recommended

How the hell do you know this game?\nAlmost regret buying it when they don't let the main protagonist wear panties.\nNo changeable outfit --- what?, but cat ears are also fine. - (You can change the color of hair/costumes)\nWhen the game feels too hard? Remember to git gut then spam your magic attack, those thing hit hard like my mom's scandal.\nThe theme color is more colorful than my gay closet.\n\nOn serious note, most of the monsters are copy pasted from SOTN and then rework their skins.\nRemember the time when you press random button to get a skill? It's back now,\nMore skills, more magics, there is a little grindy now, new weapons but same animation like SOTN\nNPCs and character voice acting about 5/7 ( not as good as SOTN),\nOST and music, very similar to SOTN but not as good as SOTN,\n\nFor 15 bucks? Well, why not? Still better than LoL on Sunday.\nI can finally quit heroin after i bought this game.\n\n7/11 would recommend this game",Recommended
"So naturally I'll change it if further play time changed my opinion but I feel pretty confident dropping this review after about 5 hours.... Its Symphony of the Night.  Or at least such a close following of those concepts that such a statement is pretty accurate.  Wide open map that you can explore requiring various unlocks to freely traverse, check.  Giant roster of monsters of various sizes and styles where their appearance  indicates very little about how difficult they will be, check.  Variety of weapons with pros and cons for each, check.  There's some new stuff too.  The graphic style updated and quite beautiful.  There's crafting and upgrading for weapons and secondary skills.  And there's a definite air of lightheartedness in the game where instead of a few peppered easter eggs they litter the ground everywhere which gives it style but at the sacrifice of tone.\n\nPoint is, I get all the feels that I got back from SotN.  The big points are all in place with the music and graphics leading the charge. I can say they delivered on their promise so recommendation received.\n\nNitpicks-  This game is not perfect.  The combat feels a bit clunky.  A lot of newer games of this genre allow you to glide through combat.  Combat in this is move or stand and fight not both (jump and slide attacks felt more smooth but the base attack was a halt button to be sure). The 2H weapons are so slow I wouldn't think of using the which is fine except for another problem.  The hit boxes aren't immediately clear.  If you're using a short sword you have to be real exacting on your positioning, and with some of the enemies knowing where you hit them and they don't hit you can be unclear (looking at you tower boss).  Lastly and this is more of a personal thing but its a bit too goofy for my taste. The anime dialogue the some of the goofier demons, its not a huge gripe but it was a little over what I would have liked.\n\nBut none of them are huge deal breakers and the overall game is quite solid and a immersive.  So I say give it a go.",Recommended
"Bloodstained is undeniably janky in a few areas, but it doesn't really take away from a well put together Metroidvania game by none other than Koji Igarashi himself. This game is very much successor to the Castlevania games that Igarashi produced, and it shows in a lot of ways. Like those games, Bloodstained is not a very long endeavor but prides itself in its replayability and allowing you to farm and make Miriam a demi-god through ridiculous stats, food eating, and shard collection. \n\nWhile I haven't finished this yet, this game was very close to beating out Aria of Sorrow as my favorite Castlevania game.",Recommended
"I'm so happy that I backed this game 4 years ago. If you love the good era of Castlevania, this game is for you! Graphics are beautiful, controls are tight, music is catchy. Great work IGA!",Recommended
"Fantastic metroidvania with a high degree of polish.\n\nVery attractive visuals since the overhaul and the animations are spot-on. This is a castlevania experience and very quickly evoked childhood memories of ""Lol how I do this?"" as I explore the gargantuan map. \n\nCombat is fun and simple with lots of room for depth and strategy with the shortcut and shard system -- if you've played Aria of Sorrow, it's exactly like that. Kill demons and eat souls for magic power with the added ability to quickly swap between loadouts midcombat. (A great idea btw.) If I had to gripe, it would be about the single-animation nature of spells and weapons. But they stayed faithful to the formula that works - perhaps to a fault.\n\nThe Music is high quality, but in my opinion lacks its own identity. It sounds too much like the rest of the castlevania series and falls short because it often reminds me of the incredible OST from Symphony of the Night without measuring up. It isn't bad at all, just expect to be let down if you played the older castlevania games and fondly remember the music. Maybe someone with a fresh perspective would have better things to say about the game's soundtrack. EDIT: After playing some more and entering new zones, I have to say there are some amazing tracks in here that might actually warrant me buying the OST.\n\nThe story isn't bad. It's a bit cheesy at times but the story is consistent, while the heroine and her supporting cast are almost all likable. The tiny conversations between characters when performing alchemy is a nice touch, and all around the game oozes charm which sometimes helps prop up some of the less impressive writing/characters.\n\nWith the large amount of day one content and a great amount of DLC (13 releases iirc) coming for free, the game is well worth the price. I can't complain about content v. price of entry here; I'll have plenty of content to make it well worth the 48$ CAD I paid.\n\nGrab it if you're itching for a metroidvania that gives you nostalgia chills. Great game.",Recommended
"I've not played very much, but to summarize my experience: this game feels link symphony of the night mixed with dawn of sorrow. If you like castlevania, or metroidvanias in general, you will like this game.",Recommended
Love it. Love everything about it. This is exactly what I wanted and It was delivered. Can't wait for more content.,Recommended
"Got the game through the kickstarter - worth the wait. 9.5/10\n\nMy only criticism would be it feels too much like SoTN in ways I was hoping for something fresh: atmosphere, theme, storyline, plot twists,  etc. Felt like 80% SotN and 20% fresh take, but it's a minor criticism and I'm enjoying the hell out of it.\n\n14 hours in and the only bug I've seen is loot drops will sometimes get stuck in a wall if a creature dies inside of it, but it's probably one of the smoothest launch day plays I've experienced.",Recommended
"It's good! It's a little buggy, but it's really good!",Recommended
"Short version: Fantastic. Buy it.\nLonger: For something like 15 years I have been blown away by Aria Of Sorrow, and constantly tried to find more like it. I've played almost every castlevania game, and just about every 'metroidvania' game I could get my hands on, and none of them quite scratched that same itch as Aria Of Sorrow.\n\nWell, Bloodstained *IS* aria of sorrow, but cranked to 11. more weapons, more monsters, locations, variety, characters, deeper lore, deeper mechanics, ...it's just aria of sorrow but polished to a mirror shine. It's freaking fantastic. I was a major kickstarter (probably too major. my poor wallet aches.) but it was genuinely worth it. Started playing around 9AM, stopped playing about 14 hours later. straight. and I only stopped because my hands were cramping up: I wanted to continue! And with the upcoming additions of co-op modes and more content, this will be HUNDREDS of hours of value, and it's damn good.\n\nget it. it's fantastic.\n\nif I have any complaints, it'd be 1: the stats could be a lot better explained. I can take educated guesses based off of similar games etc, but, it doesn't explicitly tell you things like just how much of a modifier a stat has, it merely tells you a number which is bigger or smaller than before when you're looking to put on new gear etc. so that's... annoying. and the hit boxes can be a little bit odd. generally they're very good, actually, better than most in the genre. but some lanterns you have to pixel-perfect hit in order to break, and it makes you feel like an idiot hopping up and down chopping at the air over and over and over trying to get 1$ out of a lantern, some monsters I seem to be able to hit before they're actually in range, and some you have to be on top of to hit even with long weapons? It's... odd. and again, the stats: it'll indicate that a weapon has elemental damage, but if you look at your actual attack rating, some with the same element will be super low damage and others quite high, but their base ATK is the same? sooo logically they do more or less elemental damage right? but why can't you just give me a number for it??? why hide that information? it's just weird.\n\nthat might be patched, or wikis might be created for it, so it's by no means a deal breaker, it's just... annoying.\n\nbut on the whole, this has become probably my favorite vania game ever, beating out hollow knight and even actual castlevania games. so if you like vanias: get it. it's brilliant.",Recommended
"it's SoTN 2. \nThat tells you everything you need to know , to make your decision to buy or not. \n\nSome very fun enemy and spell designs that brings a smile to your face too. It's not oh-so super-serious. \n\nHuge variety of highly detailed environments where every half a dozen rooms will be a different tile set, and a similarly large variety in enemies and spells really drives the sense of adventure an the thrill set in exploration.. \n\nAnd unlike other 2d Metrodvania's that has been released by indie studios over the past years, this game does respect the player's time. You can teleport back to home base anywhere on the map, and there are also fixed teleport points scattered throughout the world. Any backtracking upon learning new skills is easy and quick.\n\nAnd yes, there is a save room right outside the bosses' den. So when you die (inevitable) you can just hop back in and try again.  \n\nHeck, you can even soft-save (suspend) your game anywhere you want, and continue from there. Brilliant ! \n\nDrawback is that it is \nKinda expensive though.\n\nAnd sometimes it hitches while it loads new maps / incidental enemy assets. (UE 4 engine problem. Install on SSD to mitigate while awaiting updates )\n\n(Time played metric is not reflective of actual playtime as many hours was in offline mode)",Recommended
"As a biased fan of Metroidvania-type games, Ritual of the Night is a joy to play; it feels just like how i'd expect a 2.5D Castlevania game to play.

And the music is AWESOME.",Recommended
"Very worthy spiritual successor of the Castlevania series in the SOTN style.

Some enemies behave (some even look) like some of the castlevania common enemies, which makes everything feel more ""at home"". Details like the attack in mid-air while falling and being able to attack immediately if you time well are also there. Everything in this game screams Castlevania (except the title) and that's great.\n\nThe level of polish is amazing. You can even customize the look of the character and some equipment will change her appearance. The developers actually listened to the fan feedback regarding the graphics and shaders, this game looks so much better than the beta.\n\nSo far I love it.",Recommended

"I was unsure on whether or not to buy this because the lightning and whatnot really doesn't appeal to me, but I had an itch for some Castlevania so I decided to just snag it while I could.\n\n6 hours in and I have no regrets. There are some questionable things I've experienced so far (janky hitboxes/hurtboxes, fish floating out of water, etc.), but it feels like a cross between Castlevania Symphony of the Night and Aria/Dawn of Sorrow. If you were a fan of those games, I'd definitely pick this up.\n\nStory is a bit ""whatever"" for me, feels rather bland and uninteresting, but I'm in it for the gameplay, so it's not a downside for me. There's plenty of sidequests -- mostly just bring back X item, kill X amount of Y monster, stuff like that, but plenty of secrets as well, and the crafting/power up system is pretty nice so far.\n\nDifficulty is pretty standard, but it could stand to be a bit more difficult by default, I would say. You get the standard potion availability as per usual in Castlevania games of these types, along with food, which just feels like overkill and basically means you won't die unless you actively avoid using items.\n\nThe weapon variety is pretty nice, and the character is customizable to a certain extent, you can change her hairstyle, skin tone, outfit color, and she'll even wear some of the gear you equip to her on her character model, so if that's your thing, then go for it. And yes I did say skin tone, you can make her go from light skin to black, to even green.\n\nAll-in-all, I'm having fun with it, though I wish there were alternate skins or models for the Nyabon enemies and alternate sounds/models for the dog head enemies cause I don't like killing what I've known to be friendly domesticated animals for so long.

Legend come back!!! UP!!!,Recommended
"I recommend this game, but let's get some caveats out of the way:\n- Hit detection is weird. Sometimes their hits go through you and sometimes your hits go through them without damage.\n- The edges of platforms doesn't line up with their image on screen, so you fall if you try to jump from the very edge. It's 99% there, but not accurate.\n- I have run into two progress-erasing bugs. I got stuck in a menu and could only alt+f4 out, and I got stuck in a pool of water and had to reset the area.\n\nThat out of the way, this game looks and sounds great. Collecting stuff and crafting items is great. While there is some dodginess in their hit and ledge detection, it's still pretty good. There is a giant demon cat and giant demon dog enemy. It feels very much like SOTN.",Recommended

"I have been playing the game and the item icons are driving me crazy. When you pick up an item drop, the icon should not be item-specific but be item-type-specific, like the old castlevania so that we can easily identify the item type instead of checking it under every type in the menu again and again and again. It's so boring and time consuming. Can you fix this in the next update?",Recommended

"Changing this because my patience and faith in the game and community keeps dropping the more I play and see. [b]The game itself is good, though I'd heartily recommend you 1) Use a guide and 2) Stop after the first, maybe second playthrough.[/b] It suffers from very poor design choices involving key points where you can very easily get progress locked for hours due to changes to the core progression system and not knowing wtf to do next.\n\nThe story and characters are fine, though I can't stand a certain samurai who seems to be a creator's pet, being both shilled hard, stronger than nearly everyone and literally just having Solid Snake's voice in English. The side quests are shockingly unimaginative and grindy, either involving killing enemies or killing enemies to get low drop chance items to use for crafting/cooking the items you need to progress. The weapon and shard (spells essentially) selection is high, but the majority of them are worthless sidegrades you'll never use due to most of them being about the same power level and a few being significantly superior to them.\n\nThe difficulty balancing is flat out stupid in places. The first boss is fairly tough until you realise you can just attack attack attack to beat her, the second boss is stupidly hard with like a dozen attack patterns AND a second phase, which is followed by the third boss being far easier than the previous two? Okay game. The final boss is actually very easy compared to the foes beforehand too, it was disheartening.\n\nOn the technical level the game runs very solidly, though early on I did get some strange audio echoing with Miriam's voice in the starting area which stopped after I lowered a few settings. (First area's a little intensive with the weather and background) Some people have reported other issues but they were very much in the minority. Talking about sound and backgrounds, the game looks and sounds great, if a little bit too familiar to Castlevania fans.\n\n\nTo be honest, overall it feels rushed. There's no information about when the next modes/characters are to be added into the game, and there are a number of very silly mistakes like a certain boss being able to overheal past his maximum health (Being patched thankfully) and vital hints to progression sometimes skipping and not being given to you by NPCs more than once in either case. Also strangely the focus right now is on... Weakening the strong early game weapons/shards. In a single player game. Despite that the second boss is more of a midgame boss. Hm.\n\nI'll not even talk about the hot mess that is the forums, but what I said at the top is Recommended; that this IS still a good game. It should be better for sure, but it isn't bad, and you can tell that they had a vision and put love into it which can't be faulted. The issues I have with it are fixable for the most part, and they're not that bad on a first playthrough as long as you hit up a guide the moment you aren't sure where to go. Wouldn't say it's worth the effort to 100% or achievement hunt though.\n\nI might just be more sour because I expected better. For me it's a game that was amazing when I started playing it, but the more time I put in the more apparent the flaws and strange choices were. I still recommend it mostly, but I'd say get it on a sale.",Recommended
"TL;DR this was everything I wanted it to be.\n\nThis game marries concepts and mechanics from Igas ""best"" castlevania games (to me, SOTN, Arias [the ones with Soma]) as well as a few new twists (for castlevania-like games). The formula is tried and Recommended and the result is fun.\n\nLike most Castlevanias that I call my favorites, this one has the kind of backtracking I like. New areas open up. You get waypoints to warp to. One huge connected map, as far as I can tell.\n\nIt has great enemy diversity, weapon diversity. It's mechanically interesting. The game feels good. I'm only a few hours in and as far as I can tell, I'm going to love the rest of it.\n\nAs a kickstarter backer, this was worth the wait.",Recommended

"Did you like the old Castlevania games made by Koji Igarashi?  Yes?  Then you OWE it to yourself to get this game.  This is a kickstarter done right, it does everything it set out to do, be a spiritual successor to Castlevania.  It plays exactly like the old games to a T, with everything feeling doubly as familiar thanks to the OST by Michiru Yamane.  If you're one of the newer metroidvania fans that love things like Hollow Knight and somehow didn't play CV this may seem a bit slower to you, but thats the point, its not exactly trying to do anything new and groundbreaking, and thats fine.",Recommended
"After 4 years of development, hopefully it will be worth the wait.",Recommended
"Guys, it's really good. You don't have to worry about having another Mighty Number 9 or Yooka Laylee on your hands. Igarashi and his team made a great game that is clearly a love letter to Symphony of the Night. Is it as good as SotN? No, that's impossible if only for the reason that SotN was the first time we had seen this formula. Castlevania stayed pretty Recommended to that style of game throughout most of the handheld titles. Bloodstained has a lot in common with Aria of Sorrow and Dawn of Sorrow, given one of the central mechanics.\n\nEnemies you kill have a chance to grant you a shard (among other loot) that behave nearly exactly like the souls you steal from enemies in the Sorrow games. Instead of having 3 categories of ability as in Sorrow, you have a few more options here. There's the standard special attack triggered with a button press, a directional attack that you can control with the analog stick, a passive slot, a manipulator slot (which seems to mostly be a catch all for things that don't really fit anywhere else), and a familiar slot. You will use all of them at the same time, and this gives you a bit of freedom when picking which elemental types you want to focus on or otherwise adjust your loadout to your playstyle.\n\nEach shard can be upgraded in both rank and grade, with grade being an overall power boost to most abilities, and rank having various effects depending on the ability. It might increase the range of an attack or make the area of effect wider. If you fully upgrade the rank on passive shards, they become skill shards which are always equipped, freeing up your passive slot for something else. Or you can double stack the ability in both skill and passive slot for extra effect.\n\nThere's a crafting and cooking system, with food you make giving you stat bonuses that are always in effect the first time you eat each meal. These can really add up late game, and you'll probably be trying to find freakin' soy sauce forever to craft some of the food in your list. There's also a quest system, but it isn't anything special. The quests have three main varieties; bring this NPC a certain food item, kill a certain number of a certain type of demon, or bring an NPC a certain item. \n\nThere are a lot of weapon types, similar to SotN, and each type behaves differently. Knives are fast but have almost no range, whips have a slight wind up but cover a pretty decent area in front of you, and guns do gun things by shooting bullets, just to give a few examples. The weapons and armor also have various elements and damage types that they can deal or protect against, so stacking the right resist for a boss can really make a big difference.\n\nThe map is pretty large, and has a bunch of nods to SotN. If you are familiar with SotN, you'll come across many places that you remember such as the huge underground waterfall. You'll notice familiar enemy types as well, even if they look different. Flying medusa heads are here, but they aren't actually medusa heads. Still, when you see them you'll know you're gonna get petrified. The game is harder than SotN, but it isn't a hard game. It just doesn't have any super broken gear that is easily obtained and lets you faceroll the whole game without trying, like the Crissaegrim. (edit: Okay, I found this game's Crissaegrim so I take that back.)\n\nIt sure doesn't look as amazing as SotN, however. Symphony has some of the best pixel art of all time, with some gigantic ass enemies that are only in one or two spots and would be bosses in any other game. It isn't ugly by any means, but I don't think it holds a candle to the game it is mimicking. \n\nIf you like this style of Castlevania, get it. If you've played SotN, you know what to expect with the story and playing past the ""final"" boss, but even then it's still a ton of fun.",Recommended

"No dark metamorphasis, soul steal, or other Alucard special moves?! Or at least yet that I know of XD   So far, my wife is pissed, meaning that this is a good game. I am a long time  fan of the Castlevania franchise and jumped on this the minute I heard the release date! The controls are a little sketchy with timing and sensitivity. If you were an expert on the light jump hit, land and hit quickly technique, this does not do that.  \n\nHaven't noticed any bugs yet but looking for them. \n\nI do miss the sword an shield option, but not sure if Ive gotten that far yet. Not sure if there are any special weapon techniques like the rapier or the cane and medusa technique either.\n\nFinally beat the game : 99.8% map covered.\n\nThis game is almost what we've been wanting! Maybe I am missing something.... like an inverted castle that will take us up to 200% ? The one hand and shield method is missing for sure! The stupid arrows that are shot could easily get blocked with a shield. \n\nThe weapons are awesome! The bloodgrinder should have had the same effect as the other spinning sword, as they have the same physics; or at least make it a special move like < > hit\n\nAll in all, I hope there is more to this game, but no rush. I would definitely pay for a DLC for the second half of this game. Bought this for my brother on PS4 as well, his wife is pissed too",Recommended

On the opposite: The game stands on its own feet but it's also a love letter for the said Igavania titles. \nAt the moment no DLC was released but 13 are to come so if you feel like the game is short or not worth the money, just wait, there will be a lot of content, including 2 player co-op, a roguelike dungeon and THREE playable characters. \nSo yeah, good game.

Some of the weapons you can get are so good that even if it isn't your favorite drop the only reason not to use it is if you're being stuborn and really want to play a certain way.

"I genuinely expected this to be a disaster like Mighty No.9 but boy was I proven wrong.\nIt's a love letter to Castlevania games of the Metroidvania kind.\nIt plays like a mix between Symphony of the Night and Aria of Sorrow, accompanied by beautiful soundtrack by Michiru Yamane (though it could use more tracks).\nThere's a staggering amount of details and secrets, for example there's a room that reminded me a lot of a very specific room from Symphony of the Night that had a secret in the floor so I thought why not try attacking that same spot in the floor and sure enough there was a secret there just like SotN.\nThere's a staggering amount of weapons, they all have unique special inputs similar to fighting game commands (a lot of QCF mostly).\nMartial arts similar to Richter from Castlevania games.\nA much more robust Soul system than Aria and Dawn of Sorrow ever had.\nEven though this is based strictly on Ars Goetia monsters and demons, vast majority of them are 1:1 identical in function to various of the monsters from Castlevania games.\nThe game even went so far as to replicate many of the specific glitches from old games such as dash cancelling for extremely fast backdashing around the map (you are even awarded an achievement for it in case anyone had doubts about the glitch being intentional).\nYou can also jump and backdash cancel your attacks just like in the old Metroidvania CV games to maximize your offensive potential.\nThe old gate glitch from Symphony of the Night that allowed you to access the Underground Gardens area in SotN returns here and if you do it you're rewarded with a secret.\nThere's countless things like this and the sheer attention to detail is simply extremely praiseworthy.\nI could go on for ages listing all of them but that defeats the point.\n\nMy only real major issues are these:\nThe visuals, especially the animations, are very sub-par.\nThere's also huge inconsistency in assets, some of them look acceptable or even decent while others look like they were made by a c󠛡h󠛡i󠛡n󠛡k intern in an hour and the game has a lot of major visual flaws like this.\nAnimations also look pretty bad, they are so janky they remind me of early 00s ""eurojank"" games like Gothic.\n\nThen there are the horrid and immersion breaking backer portraits and enemies, the former of which are poorly photoshopped modern day photos of some backers and the latter being just oversized regular cats and dogs but with poorly slapped demon horns on them, they take up half the screen and exist only so backers can show off their real life pet. Absolutely zero creativity, thought and quality control went into said backer """"""content"""""" and it's appalling that it actually got the green light from devs to be included in the game.\nThankfully the portraits can be fixed with a mod that replaces them with a lot more tasteful Ayami Kojima paintings, but right now there is no mod to get rid or replace the backer cats and dogs. Besides this shouldn't need to be fixed with mods to begin with, additions in such poor taste never should've made it into the game.\n\nAnd finally, the last section of the game (Den of Behemoths) is just recycled content from the first ~80% of the game, namely shamelessly copypasted identical rooms but scaled up 4 times in size so your character looks tiny. Not only the rooms look awful scaled up so much, but this also makes the poor texturing and modelling all the more obvious. Not to mention that since it's a hodgepodge of rooms from various different ""locale"" from earlier in the game, they don't mesh together at all and it's just really jarring.\n\nIf a sequel gets made I do hope the visual aspect gets improved and backers aren't allowed to just self insert themselves and their pets and of course the final stretch of the game is of higher quality than here because those are pretty nasty stains on an otherwise amazing game.",Recommended

"I haven't finished the game yet (about 60% of map completion), but my general verdict is that, while it is a very good game, it's no Symphony of the Night.\n\nWhile, in terms of exploration, combat and general character progression it plays exactly like SotN (which makes it a very good game), there are areas where the game is weaker:\n\n- The soundtrack is largely disappointing. While in SotN each track is a masterpiece in its own right, which is printed into your mind immediately after you hear it, in this game only a couple of tracks are as good (namely, the first area's soundtrack and two areas a bit further into the game). The rest of the tracks aren't very coherent, well-structured, and also aren't mixed very well. On a side note, there are a few very cool musical throwbacks to classic SotN melodies that fans will definitely enjoy.\n\n- The areas often rehash SotN's areas, but lack visual diversity - while in SotN a single area could have a lot of different landmarks and designs connected with a single aesthetic, here the entire area is just a single monolithic thing throughout.\n\n- The crafting system feels too grindy - some of the mid-tier and late-tier recipes require a humongous amount of materials that are rare. And most of the stuff you find is inferior to what you can craft, which, combined with a steeper difficulty curve compared to SotN, forces you to rely on crafting and grinding to survive.\n\n- The map is not as interconnected as SotN. While it is somewhat counteracted by a bigger number of teleportation rooms, there are some areas where you will have to do a lot of backtracking. \n\n- The above is especially relevant in a couple of moments in the game where it is unclear how to progress - while I enjoy the game not giving away direct ""quest markers"", there were points where I hit a brick wall because of lapse in attention in one of random dialogues, which never happened in SotN. Having a section where you can re-read dialogues in the in-game archive would solve this.\n\n- The traversal abilities are given in forms of shards, which may be equipped in different slots. The problem is, offensive shards that you need for combat are put into the same slots, so you always have to painstakingly swap offensive shards to traversal shards each time you face a traversal obstacle. Also, connected to this is a very frustrating swimming mechanic.\n\nHowever, despite this game being strangely inferior to a 20+-year old game in terms of soundtrack and quality of life, I can still wholeheartedly recommend it - the fans of SotN and other Igavanias have already bought it anyways, and for the rest it is the closest thing to SotN's classic gameplay that can be experienced on PC.\n",Recommended

It just as well could be called the next Castlevania game (since Konami is too lame to not put out another one like this).  Even the actual map looks exactly like it did in SOTN and there's even a mysterious castle that appears from nowhere. The only thing missing is a Belmont and Dracula. Highly recommended!",Recommended
"For me, the standard of a great game is very simple and clear: whether it can draw my whole day's energy and attention to beat it or not. This game is definitely a great game, at least for me, I can't help stopping playing it from the realease time till now, sleep and eat for me is a waste of time.",Recommended

"TL;DR It's good in the same way the average Hollywood reboot tends to be.  Wait for a sale if you haven't already.\n\nHaving sufficient time to analyze this metroidvania I find it good enough to endorse to fans of the genre.  While this game seems obsessed with nostalgia feeding fans of Symphony of the Night to the point of copy pasting much of its level and sound design, I don't find it to be a bad carbon copy provided you are intrigued to know what effect 20 years of technological innovation might have on a niche phenomenon.  Users may notice a deteriorative effect on their experience if enough of the copycat vibe is perceptible to them, however.\n\nThe gameplay is smooth and satisfying if derivative of its source material.  Build diversity offers the most replay value of anything between all the weapon trees, techniques and spells.  Movesets similar to Street Fighter II offer flair to set weapon types apart from one another which are unlocked by finding a weapon that offers that technique through experimentation or scanning bookshelves for input instructions.  If you master the move it becomes unlocked for all weapons of the same type with a couple exceptions.\n\nWhether you like to shoot and loot, cast and blast or slice and dice, Bloodstained has tools to keep you satisfied with your setup with a bit of exploration or a heavy dose of RNG.  I can safely claim that LCK is the key stat to godlike status on a first or second playthrough.  So much so that I would discourage farming for secrets until you attempt a Hard mode NG+ if you plan to because over-investing will trivialize NG+ despite the welcome additions of new enemy placements and minor stat tweaks found in hard mode.  \n\nIn my opinion, Hard mode is really what the default experience should feel like as a veteran to the genre.  It is a shame it isn't playable from the outset (without cheatcodes).  Traps are much more punishing on hard with challenging enemy arrangements where as normal really felt like a ""baby's first metroidvania"" experience.  Much of this might owe to my completing normal by lvl 70+, however as previously stated.  \n\nThe game can certainly offer a challenge if you are up for a fresh start on Nightmare and unlockables  include 2 courses of boss rush and a speed run mode for those who are interested.  \n\nThe story is a hammed up anime convention at best with characters no more believable or endearing than any the Castlevania series has yet offered up.  It makes me wonder why they go to as much effort as they have to provide a relatively lifeless narrative but for the fact that porn hasn't let go of the idea since its inception either.  I suppose a plot of any sort provides some icing to the exploration based layer cake on offer.\n\nBloodstained isn't without some minor bugs at this point with a couple random crashes plaguing my two runs.  It was very smooth as a whole although I think the engine they chose for their implementation of it left some noteworthy clipping issues and an art style which doesn't seem as appealing as the cartoony vibe Shantae games make stand out by comparison.  Despite the ""we fixed dem grafixs"" trailer which showcased a paintjob prior to launch, I can't say Bloodstained looks as inspired as I would have hoped for.  Hopefully something that can be rectified in a sequel which I would welcome.\n\nI look forward to seeing what sort of ""free"" dlc will be offered up in the coming year.  I can't recommend supporting the current $10 boss + weapon cash grab unless a steam sale makes it more reasonable.  Even the $40 price tag of the game seems steep in the Steam landscape until you factor in that the Castlevania series has survived on handheld life support for years with the same price tag.  No one batted an eye so long as the purchase came with a game boy cartridge :P  For anyone on the fence I would recommend holding off for a steam sale in the next year or so.  \n\nMy chievo hunt playthrough led to 50+ hours of enjoyable metroidvania gameplay with more to explore  likely when the free dlc starts to arrive.  For a metroidvania there is a lot to explore compared to many other titles on Steam.  I think I personally prefer the presentation of indie darling Hollow Knight overall which didn't have millions of dollars to spend on its development yet managed to offer nearly as much game minus the loot system.  \n\nBloodstained hangs a lot of its hat on its rpg mechanics and progression which was enjoyable if you like games where numbers go up and a staple of the post SOTN Castlevania lineup.  I think the amount of time I spent grinding for rare drops would have been much better spent exploring new vistas.  Bloodstained can be beaten in well under 10 hours if you don't buy into killing things over and over to craft weapons with a new skin and slightly higher damage values.  As such I feel it pads its playtimes with an activity that is hardly quintessential to the values of a lover of the metroidvania formula, if such a concept can be defined and universally agreed upon.\n\nOverall, Bloodstained is an enjoyable metroidvania that suffers slightly from an overhyped fanbase and aggressive marketing tactics that only appear tame in a landscape paved by Electronic Arts and Activision to be abusive to early adopters.  Do I think the sister project, Bloodstained Curse of the Moon, would have made an amazing easter egg found within the core game rather than shelled out to rabid fans for an extra $10?  Absolutely.  You could argue Silksong is taking a stab at the same strategy but I see less generosity and more Corporate Commander in Koji Igarashi's delivery so far.  Must be some of that Konami charm rubbed off on him before he moved on.......",Recommended
"Absolute masterpiece, all the little hidden things in the game and the attention to detail is purely genious yet simply and elegantly put, Koji Igarashi is a genious and you can feel the colossal amount of work done at every step!

"Perfection! \n\nNo more searching for Metroidvania-like games on Steam. This literally is Castlevania, only I like its fresher game formula much better. The villager quests, crafting and player costume changes add a new dimension that never existed before in a Castlevania game. And there are tons of new powers to collect, each with its own level upgrades. \n\nIf you've never played a Metroidvania-Castlevania game before, or were turned off to them because they eventually became too homogenized, dated and formulaic, you have to play Bloodstained ROTN. This game's got heart and soul. It's a rebirth of the vampire corridor hunter genre. A must play!",Recommended

I've noticed and fallen for it a few times, but in this one when you compare it to Dead Cells - the seams are pretty visible.    Play it for 30 minutes and ask yourself....what the fuck did every enemy have one  attack move?\n\nThe ORIGINAL Symphony of the Night was the reason I bought a DSi, and it belongs forever among the chambers of our heroes in Valhalla.  \n\nThere is no Alucard in this game, and it has nothing to do with Castlevania..    This is borderline fraud....the staggering vote manipulation is now so redonk that a score SOOOO Overwhelming for something that nobody has heard about until that day is throwing a big old Red Flag.\n\nif it wasn't so clever, I'd be more upset - it's just the Symphony of the Night reference that makes me want to vomit.

"A couple hours into playing this so far and while I haven't tried comparative ""vania"" games since the SNES days, man, this is pretty much everything I'd expect a modern remake to be.  BEAUTIFUL environments, neat characters / enemies, a simply laid-out menu system and secrets and more.  While there is some dialogue missing in the text bubbles, speech so far is good.

"About 18% map completion and very happy with the game. I think they definitely delivered on their promise in delivering what is essentially a spiritual successor to Symphony of the Night. Miriam is a great character as well with an awesome design, and I'm enjoying exploring the castle and finding secrets. \nSome enemies have rare drop rate items/weapons as well. As an example, there's a floating sword enemy, which I killed over and over again until he dropped a familiar shard ability, which gave me the enemy as a permanent familiar companion. Another enemy early on, which uses a chainsaw-like sword, will rarely drop of version of his weapon, which seemingly has somewhat weak stats, but using it, shows it hits several times consecutively, unlike other weapons doing massive damage early game. This is one of those aspects which was in Symphony of the Night, which sort of got lost in later Castlevania games and I'm very happy to see back in Bloodstained. \nMost importantly, the music and visual design is very much Castlevania. I think the 3D visuals are a slight step back from the original 2D designs, but this can definitely be improved upon later on, if this game gets a sequel. It's definitely very close and I'm glad they had Wayforward help them improve things.",Recommended

"[h1]Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night[/h1] - the long awaited metroidvania from a famous Castlevania creator is finally here!\n\n[h1]A bit of history (short ver.)[/h1]\nBloodstained: Ritual of the Night been in development for more than 4 years. It first appeared on Kickstarter in 2015, with Koji Igarashi as Chief Producer and a new dev team ""ArtPlay"".\n \nAt first, Inti Creates (Azure Striker Gunvolt, Mighty #9) was also involved with the development of this game, but during E3 2016 it was announced that Inti Creates is no longer involved with the main game and will develop the 2D prequel called ""Bloodstained: Curse of the Moon"". \n\nHonestly, after an extremely disappointing Mighty #9, i was kinda happy that Inti Creates is not involded with main game anymore. \n\nAnd now, in 2019, we got this game released and even 13 Free DLC is on it's way, including co-op mode and additional playable characters.\n\nAs everyone saw the first two characters (main heroine and a samurai), the #3 is confirmed to be a......SHOVEL KNIGHT! Da hell, and his gameplay looks fun af. \nAnd the last one is rumored to be Aurora - a main heroine from Child of Light, together with her fairy familiar. \nCan't say anything about four playable characters, amazing work from IGA-san, ArtPlay and 505 Games putting all those collabs together.\n\n[h1] The Story[/h1]\n10 years ago Alchemist guild started to experiment on humans in order summon a powerful demons into living realm. In order to do that, they fused humans with demon crystals and used them as a sacrificial pawns in dark rituals. \nTwo childern, Miriam and Gebel, was adopted by an Alchemist guild and experimented later on.\n\nWhile Miriam fall into coma for 10 years, the experiment with Gebel succeeded and demons appeared. Being lucky, Gebel survived during ""Sacrifice"" ritual and now plan to take revenge against Alchemist guild for both him and Miriam.\n\nNow, 10 years later, Miriam awakens and found herself on an unknown ship, heading towards the Demon Castle. This Demon Castle was summoned by Gebel with his attempts to destroy the world. \nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1774490001\nAfter a short meeting, Miriam saw that something wrong with Gebel (like he's being mind controlled) and it's up to you to save your old friend and solve the mysteries.\n\n[h1] The Gameplay[/h1]\nGameplay follows a classic Castlevania/metroidvania formula, but it's refined and polished into a masterpiece. At first, you only got Miriam as a playable character and will follow her story for awhile. \n\nBloodstained offers a wide range of weapons, from CQC to mid and long range - a dagger/boots(kick them all!)/Short sword/Great Sword/Pistol and many others. And there's a lot of unique weapons too, for example, there's a normal boots, that will allow you to kick your target and Assassin Boots, that not only kick your target, but will do a follow-up attack with a hidden blade or a Spiral Sword, that's a -Great Sword- class, but performs drill-like multi-attacks. Using those weapons is extremely fun and interesting. \n\nWeapons aside, there's a lof of magic spells in the game. In order to unlock them, you must defeat normal enemies or bosses to collect demon shards. Though, normal enemies got a low chance to drop those, but each enemy drop unique magic skill, tied to that monster. A Banshee will drop ""Scream"" and a Demon Archer will drop ""Recommended (triple) Shot"". You can upgrade your magic by acquiring duplicate shards and upgrading at your Base.\n\nSpeaking of your homebase, you will unlock it after the first boss, it will allow you to take quests from survived people, craft stuff in alchemy workshop or buy/sell stuff with Church lady. Most of the quests are the generic ""Kill this thing X times"" or ""Collect X items"", but there's some unique quests too. And the jokes are good too.\n- What's those tattoos on your body?\n- Wh-wh-what are trying to say? It's......FASHION.\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1774490057\n\nLater in the game you will also unlock character customization features:\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1774490075\nAnd with the help of that i transformed Miriam into a High Elf. You can change her hairstyle, hair color, clothes and cloth color, etc.\n\n[h1]Tech-side[/h1]\n- Played this game specifically on an old PC rig - i5-2500, GTX 1060, 8Gb DDR3, normal HDD and Windows 7. Everything works great and all graphic options are on max. Also, the game support pretty much every controller, even those cheap chinese ones, just make sure that it got enough buttons/resembles Xbox or DualShock controller.\nTL;DR Bloodstained optimization is great and it should work on most old PCs and laptops.\nKeyboard + Mouse support is topnotch also, so it's fine to play with KB+M is you don't have a controller.\n\n\n[h1]The Final Verdict[/h1]\n10/10\nBloodstained: Ritual of the Night delivers to every fan, that supported it on Kickstarter and waited for 4 years for a final release. The amount of love (and work) Igarashi-san put into it together with ArtPlay and 505 games is amazing and a future 13 Free DLC will make this game into 11/10. \nSo, if you are a fan of Castlevania, Dark Devotion, Valdis Story and many other similar metroidvania games, make sure to play Bloodstained.\n\n- This review was presented to you by ""Casual Game Reviews"" Steam Curator.\n[url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/32296668-Casual-Game-Reviews/] Casual Game Reviews Steam Curator page.[/url]",Recommended

"[h1] [u]The Short of it[/u] [/h1]\n\n[u]Pros:[/u]\n+RPG like level and equipment based system for combat\n+Multiple special abilities gained through demons for varied ways to fight\n+Enjoyable exploration and combat\n+Expected, but nonetheless amazing soundtrack\n+Cooking & Customization\n+More free content on the way\n\n[u]Cons:[/u]\n+/-Short playtime required to beat the main game alone\n-While the game is polished to an incredible degree, there were a few bugs\n\n[h1] [u]More In-depth[/u] [/h1]\n\n+[u]What is the game like?:[/u]\n\nBloodstained utilizes a lot of RPG elements such as leveling up and crafting consumables and equipment, as well as offering a number of side quests. Typically enemy will drop one of two things (maybe both sometimes), either a craftable material or a shard (more details on this later). With these craftable materials you can craft or upgrade your weaponry, armor, and/or accessories. There’s a wide array of things you can grab for your arsenal, especially if you’re a completionist, but the best part of all the weapons the game has to offer you is that you can adopt a variety of playstyles suited for each individual player’s method of preference, be it in quick slashes with a katana, midrange jabs with a spear, or being as far away as possible with your trusty firearm (obviously there are more options to select from than the 3 mentioned).\n\nNow, as for “shards” as I mentioned earlier, these contain special abilities. Each enemy has their own unique ability that they provide via their shard. There are 5 main types of shard abilities (yes, 5 separate types, there’s a lot of enemies and abilities). Abilities are as follows: two castable abilities (one is set, the other is directional), can interact with the environment like removing obstacles, passive enhancements, and familiars (little helpers). Some shards can also grant unique abilities such as the standard double jump ability (boss shard), or other essential skills for progressing through the game.\n\nWeapons and shards aside, a lot of the game's charm also comes from the accessories and customization options. You have a plethora of things you can change as to how your character looks, accessories may provide stat boosts but they’re also incredibly fashionable (very early on I was an elven pirate captain, elf ears and pirate hat equipped). You can also eventually meet with an NPC that can change other finer details of your character, such as hairstyle and hair/eye/skin/outfit color (though the amount of selectable colors is admittedly a bit underwhelming for me).\n\nHowever, a metroidvania isn’t complete if the game itself didn’t both play and feel good, and I’m happy to say that Bloodstained hits all the right notes in that department. Always venturing into new territories and discovering hidden rooms and easter eggs is great, especially with how sizable the map is and all there is to find (I’ve been journeying fairly casually and have completed about a third of the map in about 5 hours). Combat is simple to describe as smooth and clean with it’s 3D sprites and attack animations (though they don’t overstay their welcome, as in lasting too long, making for relatively tight gameplay).\n\n+[u]Sound:[/u]\n\nMore just a quick note of praise, but the game is fully voiced and the soundtrack is simply breathtaking.\n\n+[u]Graphics:[/u]\n\nIf you prefer 2D sprites in your metroidvanias as I do, then don’t let Bloodstained use of 3D sprites keep you from getting this game. The game truly is a joy for fans of the genre and Bloodstained handles itself very well graphically speaking (smooth animations and high-quality models).\n\n+/-[u]Short:[/u]\n\nCastlevania games, as well as other games in the same vein, have always tended to have a playtime in the realm of about 10 hours. This is of course in reference to a single playthrough, some people have already reported beating the main story in about 6 hours. If you’re only planning to play this for a single, short playthrough, then this game may not be for you. The short time you spend in the game may still be enjoyable, but you’re missing out on a lot if you’re not the sort to get map completion or the Recommended ending, and as a result, may or may not feel as though you’ve gotten your money’s worth. So, just be aware of what you’re getting yourself into when considering this title.\n\n-[u]Bugs:[/u]\n\nThis is the only real con to speak of and quite honestly it’s not even a big one. I really only encountered a problem or two worth mentioning. The first being that item drops from demons occasionally couldn’t be picked up. It happened to me several times, but missing out on a drop every now and then is obviously not the end of the world. With that said, I don’t know what exactly was causing this to trigger the few times it did. My honest guess is that it might’ve been that the drop landed on a ledge, or overlapped with something else.\n\nThe second issue I ran into was one of the customization options, particularly the hair (option #2, long hair). Every time I made sharp turns, or other such movements, my character’s hair would go in outrageous 360s and just fly all over the place. I haven’t noticed anything else quite as disillusioning, but I definitely think it’s unfortunate that the long hair option won’t behave (hopefully to be fixed). Again, not game breaking, just a minor annoyance.\n\n[h1] [u]Conclusion[/u] [/h1]\n\nCastlevania, Igavania, Metroidvania, etc. If you like these games and/or genres, then it’s a wonder why you haven’t already started playing this amazing game. Despite the delays and skepticism Iga came through and has now made THE Kickstarter story (after so many other disappointments).\n\nThis product was reviewed with a key provided by the Developers/Publishers.\n\n[quote][url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/7871885/]Follow our curator page,[b] OCG-Curations[/b] if you like and want to see more reviews like this one.[/url][/quote]",Recommended

"OH MY GOD !!!!\n\nThanks to Lord Gabe, Thor, Zeus or whoever do you believe that this game delivered exactly what it promised.\n\nAfter the Mighty No. 9 fiasco, I was very worried about this game, then ArtPlay delivered the 8 bit game, and that gave me hope, but still I was unsertain. Nontheless I pre-purchased the game and now that I have played it, I felt something I haven´t feel in a long time when you could purchase games without worriying about microtransactions and you could buy a game solely for the company or the franchise.\n\nOk, after the nostalgic time, what you find here is a pure Metroidvania, and this in particular takes a lot of elements of the ""Sorrow"" games that came out in GBA and DS like gathering crystals (souls) that gives you habilites and if you gather more of the same crystal, you make that ability stronger, and well, if you know what a Metroidvania game is, you know that you can only proceed furter in the castle after adquiring certain habilities (*coug*Double Jump and Fliying*cough*).\n\nIndeed, this game is a Masterpiece and I´m happy to tell you, this game is a MUST if you sometime played Symphony of the Night or their secuels in GBA and DS.\n\n10/10",Recommended

Excellent Game! Just like the original Castlevania.  Can't wait for the DLC's,Recommended
"Bloodstained is the spiritual successor to the Castlevania franchise after Konami basically ditched it. It's a 2D metroidvania (obviously) with some RPG elements like finding new abilities from monsters, finding/crafting new gear, and some small character customization features.\n\nI personally like this game a lot more than others in the genre, such as Hollow Knight, since the enemies are much more varied and the environments look diverse and engaging. A lot of good items come from drops from the enemies themselves, which makes finding new enemies exciting. A lot of games take the lazy approach and have all enemies drop currency which you then use to buy things from a shop. There is currency in this game as well, but most of your gear/loot will come from hunting specific enemies. \n\nBloodstained is more like a retro game in that there are a lot of hidden Easter eggs. There are a couple that you need to find or figure out in order to completely finish the game. Pay attention to the flavor text of items because it's usually not just there for show. \n\nAs for combat, it's typically a lot slower of a pace than other platformers with all kinds of grappling hook and dash abilities. You never get completely swarmed by enemies like in Sundered. Everything is designed to be avoidable as long as you know how to dodge it and your positioning is good. There isn't a dodge easy-button with invincibility frames. It's all based on moving around, jumping, and crouching. \n\nThe game has a pretty good lifespan. If you rushed through the game and knew exactly where to go and where to find things, it'd probably take 10-15 hours. If you spend some extra time getting loot and don't look up spoilers on where to go, a full playthrough is probably around 25-30 hours. I spent 45 hours to find all the secrets, get to max level, and get 100% completion. I still plan on spending more, because Bloodstained has a New Game Plus where your progress carries over. Also, more updates are to come in the future. \n\nIf you want an immersive platformer with a great soundtrack, decently long lifespan, and lots of hidden Easter eggs, this game is for you.",Recommended

And some annoying (items clipping on land, cannot pickup) and very occasional game-breaking bugs, sometimes you will get stuck in swimming animations, causing you to either use an item to return to a place, or go back to your save spot.\n\nNot a SINGLE area block in this game doesn't feel like it was crafted with the utmost care.",Recommended

"Smooth 60fps gameplay on 4K max settings with i5-7500, RTX2070, SSD, Win10. The minimum requirement for GTX760 is higher than I thought.\n\nJust some lighting graphic effects not preloaded or a bit strange, not affecting gameplay.\nThe interface is made for lower resolutions, characters closeups and movements need some improvements.\n\nEverything else (gameplay, secrets and multi-ending, music and smoothness) are all good and match for its price.

amazing game,Recommended
"I am about 4 hours in and I am addicted. I wish I could just play this game all day but sadly I gotta be responsible :(\n\nReally good! I'm enjoying it a ton. Feels a lot like SOTN with improvements. I was iffy about the 3D but honestly, its well polished now and I don't really even think about it that much. A lot of the art is so well done i almost think its 2D sprites at times.\n\nCons:\nA lil janky on the VA / story can be a bit heavy but you can skip through that and turn it off.",Recommended
"Preface: I'm biased. I've essentially had Castlevania as a major part of my life since birth, and I've actively waited for a new Igavania since 2008, after completing Order of Ecclesia. 11 years.\n\nBloodstained: Ritual of the Night is:\n-just as or more depressing than Order of Ecclesia\n-just as or more enjoyable than Symphony of the Night\n-just as or more quality soundtrack compared to any other Castlevania game\n-just as or more fun to fully 100% compared to item-heavy games like Curse of Darkness\n-extremely memorable character design\n-dialogue and voice acting that will actively move you at certain times\n-extremely clean visuals that, though they aren't pixel art-based, are still very stylistic and nice\n-even better-flowing gameplay than other Igavanias\n-a fucking massive map, and almost too many items tbh\n\nIf you enjoyed the other games that had Iga's involvement in it, along with folks such as Michiru Yamane, Ayami Kojima, and other mainstays of the series, you'll enjoy it.\n\nIt's really, really painful to say, but it's a more enjoyable game than SotN.",Recommended
"Absolutely worth the long wait. It's beautiful, it's challenging, it's classic but fresh, it has a great soundtrack, and it's lush with a huge compendium of weapons, items, monsters, and magical techniques. Overall, it's freaking awesome. I'm immediately in love with it.",Recommended
"Pretty early right now, but i'm going in with no information and it feels like i'm playing a combination of every Igavania, both Symphony and the handhelds.\n\nI backed this four years ago, and right now it looks like another great example of a kickstarter done right, which is a pretty rare thing.",Recommended
"After waiting years for the release of this game, I thought this game would be at least a pretty fun time that would get me my Symphony Of The Night fix. I was wrong. This game has gone above and beyond what I expected!\n\nIt's like SoTn, Aria/Dawn Of Sorrow and Order Of Ecclesia rolled up into one plus various other unique touches, a great soundtrack and a much more expansive map. At the time of this review, I'm about 11 hours in after playing nearly non-stop since I installed the game and it says I'm about 50% through the map (I've been doing quests and a bit of shard/soul farming too). There have been a few small bugs here and there but nothing big and I'm sure it'll be taken care of soon enough.\n\nSome of the enemies made from the pets of kickstarter supporters are hilarious and cool at the same time. SoTN fans will enjoy the little winks and nudges included all over the place that reference the game we all love.\n\nJust get it, it's awesome.",Recommended
"I never write reviews but I was an early backer (2015...damn) and I'm loving this game. I think it is a very worthy successor to Castlevania and Igarashi has really delivered a solid game. If you like the Castlevania series you'll enjoy this game for sure. Very similar to Aria of Sorrow with its ""shard"" system. \n\nPros:\n-Great classic Castlevania gameplay \n-Shard system is awesome (a la aria of sorrow)\n-lots of cool weapons\n\nCons:\n-Graphics are ok but pretty meh in places (wait till you see the stained glass spirder/hand)\n-Cutscenes are kind of awkward. weird camera angles and shots\n",Recommended

"This game is Amazing! It feels like it mixes elements from Symphony of the Night, Dawn of Sorrow, and Order of Ecclesia, while adding new elements that compliment this Igavania style games even more. It has lots of surprises that fans of Castlevania will love, and should also be interesting to newcomers. The visuals are fantastic, the soundtrack is up to par with Castlevania standards, and so is everything else. The story is interesting with interesting/funny characters complimented with good voice acting. The adventure is fairly lengthy with even more extra content via shards and drop items to be collected on your first save. Also following the trend of the older Igavanias, there is also new game plus with a playable Zangetzu and apparently a lot more DLC modes are coming in the future. As a huge Castlevania fan this game has blown me away on day one and I can't wait to see what else will be added to this treasure.",Recommended

Castlevania is back!,Recommended
Absolute perfection.,Recommended
I really liked this game. It is a great throw back to Castlevania Symphony of the Night. I played the game for 6 hours straight and had loads of fun. Sure there is a glitch now and again but this is day 1. If you like old school Metroidvania games this is for you.,Recommended
"I backed this game during a time when Kickstarter campaigns were everywhere. There wasn't really much in terms of knowing how they'd go, but this was the one project which really stood out to me. It has been a very bumpy road, but here we are. After such disastrous failures as Mighty No.9, boring endeavors such as Yooka-Laylee, among many others somewhere between, we reach the long awaited final hope for a lot of people. This game took a lot longer to come out than first expected, and technically the game is still unfinished (but will be getting free DLC to cover in the missing content) I find it very important to clarify where I am coming from.\n\nEither way, the game is here. I really am enjoying it so far. It did just crash, once. Not all that bad for day 1. I'm maybe 35% through the game, and while it isn't as much a 1 to 1 clone of Symphony of the Night as the other Bloodstained retro game was to Castlevania 3, it is a good fix to a desire to play such a game as that again. I will surely update my review when the rest of the promised content is actually out and played by myself, but as it stands this game has been quite the fun ride, and is highly recommended.",Recommended
"Turned out to be worth its expensive price tag.\n\nPlayed 7.8 hours on the first playthrough, got 29% of story completed.\nIf you plan to unlock everything, expect 50 hours+ lifetime.\n\nLong time Castlevania fan. Koji Igarashi did not disappoint.\nThe music is very good.",Recommended

"Edit -\n Just adding in the video review I made of the game, check this out too if you want!\nhttps://youtu.be/oJimKUztaI0\n\n\n\nIt's Castlevania in everything but the name.  The game follows every Castlevania trope to the last point.  It's actually pretty amusing how much Iga brought over and all he had to do was change all the names.  \n\nIt does have a slight twist to the style, its Industrial Revolution/Alchemy based Gothic more than a horror gothic.  But demons are still about, destroying the world while a Castle gets mysteriously summoned, you know.. the story at this point.\n\nIf you love those Castlevania games, you will enjoy this game.  It's not a masterpiece the way SoTN was, but it holds up with the DS and GBA versions.  \n\nRitual of the Night is clearly most influenced by Aria of Sorrow/Dawn of Sorrow with a soul-collecting style of subweapons and abilities.\n\nYou will  get tons of souls, more than you will even bother trying, once you find the over powered ones you will stick to it. Either way, if you love grinding souls and items, this game will be for you.  It has a vast crafting and souls system(shards in this game) that seems like it could be interesting if I were into it.  \n\nHowever I'm not into it, and thankfully it was not required to go overboard to play the game.  You collect the shards naturally as well as materials. You build with whatever you find and you get adequate equipment to win the game.  If you want to get into it, you can make yourself completely overpowered.\n\nNow the best part of the game to me was the level design was done superbly.  At first I thought it was going to be similar to the small and linear levels of Portrait of Ruin, but the map just kept growing and growing.  Things became a bit of a chore to traverse but at the same time there was plenty of fast routes throughout.  There was a lot of times where I had to think where to backtrack to, and subtle hints throughout the game on what to do.  There were a few moments I had to really think to advance in the game which I enjoyed. I got stuck a couple of times but I was always able to find my way out. The Castle is huge, when he says its his biggest one yet, it definitely is, and it was designed well too!\n\nNow the problem with the game was the difficulty.  First off, hard mode and nightmare mode are locked behind beating the game so you HAVE to play normal first.  The issue here is the game was a cakewalk once you found a few overpowered weapons and shards.  Sure you can not use them, but either way the bosses were just all easy.  I took them all out mostly on my first attempt of just spamming Damage on them and if that didn't work, learning their patterns was not hard. \n\nHell I found the  crissaegrim equivalent (SOTN most powerful weapon)  in the first 1-2 hours of the game and was still switching to it at some points on even the last boss of the game.  It was so powerful early on that by the end of the game it was still viable to use.  Don't get me started on the poltergeist shard, talk about powerful early access subweapon too..\n\nSo overall, its an adequate Castlevania game.  It's not SoTN or even Aria of Sorrow(though it's probably closest to Aria of sorrow than anything).  The game plays smooth, felt great to play, the combat was what you expect, it moved well and looked great.  It had way too much crafting, it went overboard there in my opinion and the difficulty was too easy, but there is replayability there for harder modes so I look forward to that. (I don't play games over so close though, so now I have to keep my save file to make sure I can play hard next time I jump in it.) \n\nI also look forward to some Zengetsu mode, and maybe some sequels in the future.  I had fun playing this, I'd say its a solid 7/10.",Recommended
Holy shit it's actually good.,Recommended
"As a long time fan of the Castlevania franchise and the SotN like games in particular, I started playing this yesterday and couldn't put it down for 6 hours.

"This game is a must for Castlevania fan but there are still room for improvement. I wished the music were continuous since the transition from one place to another is some what unpleasant because there was no music, the developer can refer back to Aria of Sorrow to improve this. Also, there are a lot of sound effects which should have been there but they did not, like in the first boss fight where she slam the giant tentacle on the ground with zero sound effect (!?!?!) somewhat turn me off. Other than that, the game is so far so good. I love the graphics. All values of earlier soul system (now known as shard) has been maintained and even improved (I personally love the directional share very much).",Recommended

"If you enjoy Castlevania titles in a similar vein of the critically acclaimed Symphony of the Night, then you will enjoy this title. SotN is one of my favorite games ever made, and I can confirm that Bloodstained lives up to the hype surrounding it. Even if you have minimal / no experience with Castlevania titles, this is a great way to get started with the series as Bloodstained is far more accessible then any of the other games currently.\n\nFor those who are unaware, Bloodstained is a 2D side-scrolling adventure with a heavy focus on exploring (think of Super Metroid) with RPG elements. It even carries the signature flare that Castlevania fans have come to love. \n\n\nAt the end of the day: This game is a masterpiece. If you are somewhat interested, try it -- you'll love it. Bloodstained broke the kickstarter curse. Here's hoping we see more Castlevania titles in the future.",Recommended

"What a game...  this one deserves a more detail review, and it will get one later, but I just wanted to be part of the aggregate opinion.  \n\nLooks great, runs great, nothing so far has given me the feeling that it didn't belong or was a victim of the times(I missed the old Vepar model, but the one in the current game is still gorgeous and terrifying).  It gave me that old feeling that I used to get at the beginning of a really great game.  The Metroidvania genre isn't always done justice, but here I get the impression that a master is at work.  Even on ""Normal"" the game presents a challenge.\n\nThe sensation of ""Castlevania"" coupled with modern graphics is done beautifully.  It has already had several vista's that feel like art,  and I am not that far in.  The voice acting is solid, the story treads the same beloved pathways, the combat is good, and very reminiscent of old Castlevania, but with better mobility.  The music is all well composed and recorded, I have encountered a few missions where is feels out of place, but have no complaints.  \n\nThe dark baroque/Gothic vibe is on display, impossibles castles, blood moons and monsters.  Miriam is a solid protagonist, embued with super natural abilities, Sympathetic and quite lovely.  The escapism is never compromised in this title.  (so far)\n\nFor now, I have to give it a resounding ""Excellent"", this game as worth the wait, worth Pre-ordering and more than worth the asking price.\n\nIt's good to see that even though 3D games are everywhere, that we can still have well made 2D titles...  (2.5d, I know)\n\nI hope this is incredibly successful.  I want more, sequel or DLC, I'll buy 'em Both.\n\nIga came through.  Definitely a Kickstarter success.",Recommended

"God only knows how long I've waited for a Metroidvania of this depth, of this size, of this insane amount of polish and care.\nRitual of the Night is, for all intents and purposes, Symphony of the Night 2. Everything that Symphony of the Night did, Ritual does just as well and even better in some areas. Customization, weapons, quality of life improvements, everything has been overhauled and revamped using modern technology and game design techniques.\n\nThis is a Metroidvania title that you aren't going to want to miss. It's everything that defined the genre, everything that defined Symphony, reawakened and reborn. The movement is sleek and sexy, the abilities are a mixture of somewhere between Soma's Souls and Shanoa's Glyphs, and navigation of the biggest Castle to date, means you're in for a wild ride. I'm currently 10 hours into the game as of this review, and the game tells me I've only explored 50% of the map. You heard that right. 10 hours in, and I'm only 50% explored. Of course, I have gotten hopelessly lost after beating Bloodless and have no clue where to go now, which might have added 3-4 hours, but the fact that I can beat Order of Ecclesia in about 3-4 hours and still have more game in Ritual speaks volumes about how much content Mr. Igarashi has packed into this adventure.",Recommended

I've already found out where you can change Miriam's appearance. This game is [i]Castlevania: Symphony of the Night[/i] on steroids so far. Detailed tidbit and great gameplay. Best of all: the feedback from the beta was taken to heart. There's some roughness around the edges that I could point out, like some occasional minor hitching at max settings at 144 FPS (down to the mid 100's) in some scenarios, but I'm pretty satisfied so far and expect these will probably be improved on, much like the changes from alpha/beta to now.\n\nThis is everything a modern castleroid/metroidvania should be. Full voice acting in English and Japanese, crafting, exploration, leveling, gear, [i]Aria of Sorrow[/i]'s magic system, quests, the whole shebang.\n\nGET IT!",Recommended

"Holy hell! This is a metroidvania that was worth the wait!\n\nThe graphics may seem odd in the videos, but in-game the art style + animations really click and work together.\n\nEvery QoL that you wanted from SoTN, AoS and DoA are here. More words aren't enough to make this game justice, just make yourself a favor and play away.",Recommended

"Castlevania: Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night is one of the best Castlevanias to ever erect a giant erect castle. You play as Shanoa, a mischievously flirty waifu flaunting some tarty little gothic wear, hunting down her much-less-powerful twin brother Alucard ""Gerbel"" Oatmeal.\n\nAlong the way you'll encounter all sorts of interesting characters, like the fast-talking smartmouth David Hayter, played by some rando named Zangetsu, the librarian vampire Overdose running an elaborate bookkeeping drug front, and making a special guest cameo: Alfred, after leaving Batman to become the world's greatest wizard.\n\nThe gameplay is typical Castlevania fare, in which you grab and swing around a giant castle to fend off infinite blue Flappy Birds flying in static pattern loops.\n\nOccasionally you'll assault and maim a boss who didn't provoke you at all, like the demonic manifestation of Scrooge's money bin, or a nice red lady whose time of the month seems to have spiraled out of control. Not even the moon itself is safe from your wrath.\n\nIn between missions, you bake pizzas and snap selfies. You can also take bounties from a crazed old bag who's curiously obsessed with murdering her friends.\n\nThe game was ported by the legendary IGA, a well-known fashion icon who dabbles in game design and aggressively trolls fanboys who own the Switch. Truly this is his masterpiece, one of his best Bubsyvanias, a love letter to anyone who doesn't particularly enjoy pach!nko machines.",Recommended
"Not only is this game good, it's real good. You should take a c l o s e look at the system specs for both this and the DLC, though.",Recommended
"Great so far. I was a bit iffy in the tutorial area, but once you get into the next area it really gets into the groove.\n\nIt's a lot more like Aria of Sorrow so far than Symphony of the Night, but that's not a bad thing, considering Aria of Sorrow is BETTER. But yeah, finding monster souls I mean demon shards is fun.",Recommended
One of the best game of 2019,Recommended
"This is my first castlevania like game, it is purely amazing, addicting, amazing boss battles, but it definitely has some flaws. I definitely wouldnt call it a masterpiece, I dont mind games that dont hold your hand, but I reached the point that its starting to get annoying, first off the water levels are god awful with no actual swimming mechanic till later on. you wouldnt know how to get the swimming ability without a video to point it out to you, my next biggest gripe is the map is all over the place I've reached the point idek where to go after the hidden desert, you get information to find this certain cave for you to progress but no designation of where it is or general direction, I spent a whole hour now retracking my footsteps to no avail and i still dont know where to find it, I was enjoying the map setup and how everything connects but now its just a clusterfuck lmfao Idk if the castlevania games were ever like this but its a headache. My third issue which isnt so bad is having teleportations points so far from eachother and if you die you could possibly be spending 20 mins trying to get back to where you are at. Other than that the game has been really enjoyable, but I might have to wait for video if im ever going to find this damn cave :(",Recommended

"Game play is great and movement feels good. Customization options for the character appearance are a nice touch, and there are many weapon types you can chose from. After nearly 5 hours in, its hard to put down. Would recommend heavily if you enjoy the -vania genre.",Recommended
"It's really bad. It doesn't feature erotic violence or pachikos where you hit the lever and cry like an anime fan on prom night. \nin all seriousness, this game is a love letter to castlevania fans. It features the best aspects of Lament of Innocence, Symphony of the Night, Portrait of Ruin, Aria/Dawn of Sorrow, and there's multiple ways and strategies to fight your enemies (May edit once I get to the higher difficulties, which are unlocked by clearing the game normally). Graphics are okay and the game runs decent. Instant recommend for those who are into metroidvanias (assuming they haven't brought it anyway) and would recommend at least trying for those who never played a metroidvania. [I haven't beaten the game yet, but unlikely to adjust review unless there's a crippling flaw later in the game (doubtful)]",Recommended

"Everything I wanted and more! Bloodstained has easily supplanted Order of Ecclesia as my favorite IGAvania-style game, and that's in a very short timeframe. The final result is, more than most other Kickstarter games? Polished, refined, beautiful, and just a lot of fun. There's a few small snags with control reminders for keyboard early on, but those little missteps aside it's just... So good to see what might be the beginning of a new franchise king.\n\nUnrelatedly, make sure to try out the [b]Sculptor's Chisel[/b] from the 8-bit coin alchemy options. Not that I have anything to do with that. <.<",Recommended
"This has exceeded my expectations! It's all of the best elements of SotN with some of the atmosphere of Lament of Innocence tied in. Not only does it fulfill my Castlevania fetish, but it stands perfectly on it's own. The gameplay, graphics, music, story and characters will easily pull in new gamers not familiar with old school Castlevania. A definite 10/10!",Recommended

The Dodge / Backstep Button Was A Game Mechanic I Am Glad To Use Again.\n\nOnly Complaint Is As Follows:  When Using A Playstation 4 Controller In The Game, The Joystick Has A Hard Time Deciding If I Am Just Kneeling And Slashing Waist High, Or If I Should Be Doing A Downward Slash, Can Be A Pain In The Butt When Trying To Hit Smaller Enemies. If I Use The ""Joypad "" i.e. Up, Down, Left, Right Buttons The Problem Dose Not Happen.\n\n",Recommended

"As of writing, 6 hours in and so far 20% map completion, and that's JUST map completion. Let's not get started on going about collecting all shard types and item drops... \n\nIf you ever played and enjoyed any of the 'Igavanias' on playstation, gba or nds, this is well and truly a worthy successor from the man himself, and VERY fairly priced for the quality game that's been given. \nIf you actually care about finishing up a game properly, collecting at least majority of collectibles, and exploring the world, I'd estimate game is at least worth ~30 hours, possibly uptowards 40, while story rushing would probably take around 7~12 hours depending on how skilled you are and how hard you push yourself for story alone.\n\nLittle to no REAL issues faced within the hours I played (only had some loot drops not dropping well from flyers, but there's a tripsafe for those fortunately), and game is pretty darn well optimized as well. Much better optimized than what seems to be the standard nowadays (them major day 1, 2 and 3 critical bugfixes, don't you hate them?). Even so tech freaks will be tech freaks I suppose, ever wanting for their 4k or ultrawide support... maybe they'll get it someday if they ask nicely.\n\nDefault keyboard+mouse controls ain't bad at all, although controller is highly recommended.",Recommended
"Amazing game, if you like metroidvania games buy it.",Recommended
Really exceeding my expectations so far. Plays and feels like a Recommended Castlevania game. I love metroidvania titles so naturally this is right up my alley.,Recommended
"If you love metroidvania games, stop reading reviews and just buy it already.\n\nThis game is spiritual successor to Castlevania, and in my opinion it does it right.\nShards that act like souls of aria/dawn of sorrow, lots of different weapons, \neaster eggs hidden everywhere, quests, weapon-dependant techniques for varying gameplay \nor for picking your favourite weapon type, crafting, fast travel to the area with shop and crafting NPC, \nbestiary that shows how many different items enemies can drop, and shows their droprates, \ngood voice acting... i could go on forever.\n\nAfter another game's kickstarter failed to meet expectations of backers, \ni was hesitant to back this, but i did it anyways and i regret nothing.\nBloodstained: Ritual of the Night completely fulfilled my expectations, \nif a sequel ever comes out, i'm definitely buying it.\n\nThe only problem i have with this, is that the Hard and Nightmare difficulty settings \nare locked until you beat the game in normal mode.\nHowever, this can be fixed by naming your save: NIGHTMARE\nthis permanently unlocks the higher difficulty settings, so you can make another save and name it whatever you like, \nwhile still being able to select Hard or Nightmare settings.\nThere are supposedly more secret codes in the game, but i have not found them yet.\n\nThe game has some minor bugs, but i couldn't find anything game-breaking.\nAnd as the developers have already promised to give this game several free updates,\ni'm sure the bugs will be addressed soon enough,\nso don't let a few minor bugs drive you away from this amazing game.",Recommended
"For LINUX users: works well with Proton 4.2.7 on Ubuntu 18.04.2. I suspect there would be no problems with Manjaro as well. You will need to set the screen to ""Borderless Full Screen"" in the setting to avoid a LowLevelFatalError. Otherwise, the game runs smooth. \n\nFrom the few moments I've played, this looks amazing, sounds great (Michiru Yamane is on the OST once again), and the controls is feels intuitive even on a keyboard and mouse. Can't wait to finish this game.",Recommended

"This game feeds the itch that Symphony of the Night left all these years. Koji surely didn't disappoint and to me was worth the wait. There are so many good points about the game I honestly can't think of a single bad thing to say about it.\n\nEnemies:\n All of the enemies are interesting I honestly can't find a second where I'm bored even if I decide to grind out some levels to make the game a bit easier. The boss fights are engaging and it will test your reflexes along with character placement skills. \n\nMusic: \nThis area did not disappoint in the slightest, it has a beautiful score in every room that you enter and this alone is at the start of the game. As you change sections the music will change, but there is however one area of the game without music at all. \n\nGameplay: \nIt feels so smooth that controlling Miriam feels wonderful, It feels like the old Castlevania: Symphony of the Night but with a different character from the bloodstained original game. So many variety of skills to select from even at the start and a lot more awaits. For those who are concerned with weapon speed I know some weapon do have a passive skill you can find to increase your attack speed, so it was by design. \n\nIn Conclusion I feel as though this game is a masterpiece and a wonderful work as being typically within the gaming industry myself I wish I was on the team that created this title. If you appreciate an older style Castlevania game you will love this as it will not disappoint. My review is not endorsed or funded by 505 games nor ArtPlay this is purely from a consumer standpoint.",Recommended
"Must play for SoTN and ""Metroidvania"" fans, a much needed return to form that hits all the right marks. Wide variety of weapons to choose from, customise your equipment, take on quests, level up, collect familiars, spells and abilities, this is definitely one of the more robust entries to come from Iga. Only downside is the cutscenes are a bit cheap and janky, but its a minor complaint, the gameplay is top notch.",Recommended

"IGAVANIA IS BACK, BABY.\n\nIn my opinion, this is the first Kickstarter game that actually delivered in its promises (and this began last year with the EXCELLENT ""Curse of the Moon"") you can actually see where the budget went (unlike with games like Mighty N°9 or even Shenmue III), and that this game was made with passion and devotion (unlike most Kickstarter games that are just quick cashgrabs to bank on nostalgia).\n\nThere is not much else to say, if you liked Symphony of the Night, you are gonna love this one, but beware, the game can get a bit too difficult if you are not an expert on these type of games (I'm reading a lot of people saying this game is actually pretty easy, so maybe I just suck, lol), but as all Igavania games, is just a matter of leveling up, find the right weapon, and well, git gud.\n\nThe game has a lot of FREE DLC coming up, including Zangetsu (who is voiced by David fucking Hayter) as a playable character.\n\nIf I have to mention a negative aspect, the game doesnt run ""on a potato"", I have above the minimum requeriments, and I experience some slowdows at times, so keep that in mind.\nThis game was going to come out on Playstation Vita, so it SHOULD run ""on a potato"", but it doesnt.\n\nIn short, buy this game, support Iga-san, show the world that when these projects are made with passion, the results live up to the hype, and show Konami that there is a lot of interest in new 2D Castlevania games.\n\nEdit: Ok, just beat it, while I still think this game is fantastic, for the sake to be like the classic Igavania games, the game falls apart at the end.\n\nYou are going to have a blast going all the way to the final boss and fighting him...only to receive a ""game over"" screen.\n\nJust like with SOTN, you need to avoid killing the ""final"" boss by using an item, problem is, in this game to get said item, you need to make A LOT of backtracking, and worse of all, what you have to do is extremely cryptic, Simon's Quest levels of cryptic.\n\nYou also get the ability to invert the screen in the search for this item (again, like in SOTN, except now you can do it at will), and this ability destroys the level design, you will get lost and confused.\n\nIn short? the game is a 9/10 until the ""last"" boss, but then falls apart, it reminds me of The Messenger, another game that has the exact same problem.",Recommended

"My soul is happy. SotN is the game that made me a gamer and this is a worthy successor to that legendary franchise.\n\nThe gameplay is crisp, smooth, and fluid. The combat feels fun; rather than one weapon I actually enjoy trying each of the weapons, shards, and skills.\n\nThe voice acting is surprisingly good for a 2D Metroidvania, but this is no surprise with the talented voicework of Robbie Belgrade (Alucard of SotN fame) and David Hayter, the one and only Solid Snake.\n\nEnemy variety is great, I love the mix of classic Castlevania style enemies to the more eclectic demons summoned by Gebel. The bosses (so far) have tended on the easy side, but each has its own patterns and attacks to learn and counter.\n\nThe Recommended beauty of Bloodstained is that while it drinks from the same blood-filled chalice as prior Metroidvanias, it carves out its own vein with a fun and unique experience. I cannot wait to play more.\n\nI have never been so happy to play a game in many years.",Recommended

I enjoyed the new visual style, and even the 2.5d. During this games version of the clock tower level 2.5d is put to great use and it felt like it fit the dizzying and treacherous nature of the cogs and platforms of the twin towers. There are several satisfying bosses and the amount of build diversity possible from gear and skills are truly fantastic. Also, the music is truly sublime and fits each zone perfectly.

"This game is very addicting because of all the stuff you can collect. Looting, crafting, cooking, upgrading...\n\nThere are a lot of fun skills and weapons you can play around with so go ahead and find your play style out of virtually endless possibilities. You can feel very versatile and powerful. Especially towards the end when you have access to your full moveset and are superfast. What was mindblowing to me is that every passive buff, of which you can only equip one at a time, will become permanent once you upgraded them to their maximum. \n\nAlso the option to have quick swap loadouts is very handy. You don't need to define every slot, only what you want to change. I had one for farming, for screen wipes, max damage to single targets, crafting/shopping and traversal. Only how item usage is handled is confusing. There is an unused button on the controller and it's not for your equipped item. Instead it's used whenever you select a different loadout. \n\nYou should have the option to toggle default positions of tabs on/off. Same for list sorting. While you can have favorites which will always be on top, you have to arrange every list every time anew. And there are not enough options for that when crafting. It could be much smoother. When you want to 100% this game, all these little annoyances will stack.\n\nAlso the presentation feels somewhat cheap. The blocking of the cutscenes. The font choice. Some of the lighting. Repeated lines. Unusual difficulty spikes. The localization for germany is a big one... mostly little stuff that can be disregarded, but put them together and it dampens the impression this game could have had.\n\nFurthermore, the game can be very cryptic. It is Recommended that NPCs will occasionally give you hints but critical points are not telegraphed well enough despite them being counterintuitive. As soon as you learn how to maneuver through underwater areas, you'll know what I mean. I found myself wasting so much time doing pointless stuff because I couldn't figure out where to go next or how to progress. You do get a bubble that shows you breakable walls but that won't help you get the good ending. During a certain time window you have to attack something other than the final boss with a specific weapon. How anyone is supposed to figure that out is beyond me. It's total moon logic.\n\nThere are many silly features that serve no particular purpose but are most welcome to make you smile and to express yourself. There are plenty of easter eggs, but mostly references.\n\nObviously this game is inspired by prior works of the same team for a now dead IP. And I do like those previous games very much... some more than others. Problem is, when you know the history of their creative efforts you'll notice the lack of creativity in this title. It's basically just fan service and blatant ripoffs. I begin to see a trend. Something only gets crowdfunded when it's based on something everyone already knows. This doesn't incentivise originality. And it caps every project's potential. It can only be as good as something before, but modern. \n\nUnfortunately, despite all its merits, some ironed-out flaws that were inherited and all the fun to be had, Bloodstaind: Ritual of the Night does not reach the style and class of the first incarnation where all genre defining tropes took full shape. \n\nAlbeit the music is pretty sweet :3",Recommended

Im running it on a standard non gaming laptop and had to really turn down the graphics to get a good fps so be wary if you dont have a system that can handle it.  The story scenes are a bit boring as its just lines and lines and lines of dialogue but the lore inside the castle has captured my interest.

The Kickstarter backer's content (in-game portraits, pet monsters, etc) actually mesh incredibly well with the game, everything feels fresh and looks good.\n\nI have very few complains about this game, one being that the shop feels mostly useless: items that you want to buy are very expensive, and selling items is pretty worthless overall (I think the same item is 2.5k if you buy it, but if you sell it, it's 350g). The other being that so far (65% of the map discovered) I got stuck real hard twice having no idea where to go or what to do next, thankfully some people on the community hub helped me out, I have no idea how they figured that stuff out.\n\nI'm very excited for the DLCs to come and I hope a few things get changed in time for the better, but overall this game is pretty solid and I've been playing it non-stop since it released. 100% recommended.",Recommended

"Let me begin with saying my review might be slightly biased because I am an avid Metroidvania fan, however, my review will progressively be updated as my play through continues. (Still open for changes)\n\nMy Current Playtime: 19.3 Hours so far.\n\nReview\nStory: 9.4/10 - The story is actually quite compelling and pulled me in right from the beginning. I didn't expect it from a Metroidvania, since most of the genre generally throws the player into the fray almost immediately with brief introductions. This game seems to have a well thought out and highly detailed story. Woop! :D\n\nGame play: 9.5/10 - Side scrolling action game with minor rpg elements. This game plays and feels like a typical Castlevania game. More specifically, Aria of Sorrow/Dawn of Sorrow. Kill enemies to gain powers then use the enemies powers to decimate other enemies, unlock secrets, access new areas, fight bosses, etc. This game also has a simplistic yet satisfying crafting & cooking mechanic.\n\nAudio: 8.7/10 - Every cut scene, maneuver, dialog, attack, etc., all has unique sounds and music playing. The songs and music emulate the chromatic fantasia genre. It fits the style, atmosphere and setting of the game. I was also surprised to find out that everyone has their own voice over in game. The only issue I found so far was that sometimes during dialog the audio seems to come in and out.\n\nGraphics: 9.3/10 - Wow, Iga actually did it. He listened to the community and with his best efforts was able update the graphics. This game is well polished and unique. The game looks gorgeous on max settings when streaming to my 55 inch 4K TV. \n\nContent 9.5/10 - This game has a compelling story, rich character development, side quests with tons of areas to explore.\n\nControls 8.5/10 - Controls are pretty standard for a side-scrolling ARPG. It can feel a bit slow at times and a little out-dated. Besides that, the controls are smooth and well polished for a Metroidvania.\n\nOverall Score: 9.2/10 (Thus far)\n\nI can tell you right now that this game is not a failure like everyone was afraid it would be and was well worth the wait. The game is absolutely wonderful. The $40 price tag seems to be well worth it. I am thoroughly excited to continue my play through of this game. Thank you Iga, for making our dreams come Recommended.",Recommended

"VERY good game, - as I've only put in approx 4 hours into this....\n\nBUT\n\n***DO NOT*** invest yourself in Whips. I bought the ""Ambivalence"" whip early on after finding a coin, and regret it 100%. The whip playstyle is VERY fun, BUT its VERY buggy. Haven't tested/played enough to figure out if it's the weapon itself, or the entire Whip weapon style. I'm currently on the second boss, and without fail I become glitched in the air for a prolonged amount of time until the boss hits me again, losing 100~ health in the process.\n\nStill up-thumbsing this, but I hope one of their programmers fixes it soon. It's a shame I used that coin on the weapon :(.\n\n---\n\nEDIT: After playing for another 3 hours, I've determined that whips are ""Okay"" (Hella fun!), but the response time on attacking/movement when using Whips is too choppy. Too clunky of a weapon unfortunately. Compared to a few different Whips; ""Ambivalence"" is SIGNIFICANTLY more clunky for some bizzare reason.... I've also noticed a few bugs forcing me to ALT F4 and pick up the game my previous save point. (Good thing i'm careful and save every chance I can lol).... The game doesn't freeze, but you lose control of your character and/or disappears from the screen - Happened to me after defeating the third boss during animations.\n\nI am NOT bashing this game. I am heavily invested and have enjoyed every 7 hours of this game so far :). Hopefully these minor things get patched soon.\n\n-A fellow circle of the moon advocate",Recommended

Ah the wait is over and I can honestly say I am pleased with it :D,Recommended
this game truly does the term sequel justice in my opinion. i strongly recommend giving it a try the variety of weapons and abilities is an incredibly great addition to the game as well as the combat techniques and customization. ontop of that the functionality of shops and open world-ish exploration is pretty awesome. all that and were seeing some real character development from old friends from the original game. so far my favorite thing about this game is that it does justice to itself as a game that takes inspiration from the Castlevania series but at the same time has its own personal flair <3,Recommended
Iga delivered what I wanted as someone who has played all of the games in this genre and I can't be any happier. Having a great time and just waiting for the day 1 patch it hit to play more.

"Boy am I surprised.  I expected this to be sort of the ""Yooka Laylee"" of the Castlevania series, aka ""Kickstarter mediocrity - missed the mark, lacking something, but not necessarily horrible""\n\nHOWEVER, I'm extremely pleased to say I was wrong, at least from what I've seen in my first few hours playing.  This is the next Recommended 'igavania' title.  The music, the level design, the variety of weapons and items... it's all here, and it looks like there's plenty to do.  Not only is the game world large and complex, it's also full of secret areas, quests to fulfill for rewards, food recipes to cook that boost your stats the first time you eat them, equipment recipes to craft out of stuff you buy and find in the world, etc..\n\nThere are a lot of things here that mimic the games that inspired it, because you can't have a spiritual successor without paying homage to what came before.. but Bloodstained also strikes out to build its own new identity alongside that legacy.  It continues the style of the 2D exploration/open-world Castlevania series Igarashi pioneered in his time at Konami, at a time when that publisher didn't think this kind of game would sell well enough to fund another.. and they pulled it off with style, and with just enough originality that it doesn't feel like a clone.\n\nThe Shards system, which works much like the Souls in ""Dawn of Sorrow"" are fun to collect.  I'm always excited to see what each one does, and although a few of them may seem a bit similar at first glance, the outcome of using them usually shows each to have something unique that sets it apart from similar abilities.  I can't speak too much on the more passive shards, as I haven't found many yet, but the quick-use and directional ability ones are all quite cool so far.\n\nIt's worth noting that each type of weapon you can find has its own swing arcs, attack speeds, etc.. but also there are hidden abilities to unlock within these weapons that allow you to do special attacks at the sacrifice of some of the MP you'd usually use for Shards.  This makes crafting, finding, or buying and trying all the different weapons in the game fun, and keeps things interesting.\n\nBoss fights can be difficult sometimes, but they're pretty fair.  Getting your butt kicked?  Pay attention to the enemy's pattern, learn it, react to it, and you'll succeed.\n\nAll that said, there are a few small problems I've had.  Stuff that can hopefully be addressed, but isn't so critical that it ruins the game entirely.  Minor annoyances.  One of these small problems is that dropped items from enemies have gotten stuck in walls where I can't reach them maybe twice so far.  This could be fixed by them either programming the walls to push items out to the nearest empty space, or if that's hard to do then in some cases making your weapon's hitbox area count as touching the item would help a lot.\n\nThe other issue is that sometimes when you're using a shard ability in mid-air, if you land right after you press the button to do it, the MP will be wasted but the attack won't fire because it's cancelled by the animation of landing on the ground.  I guess this could be fixed by shard ability animations being able to delay the landing animation perhaps?  I'm not really sure, but hopefully something can be done.\n\nAnyway, if you want to know if the game is worth it, I'd say 100% yes, for a fan of any Igavania games like Symphony of the Night, and probably for most fans of Metroidvania style games in general.  If you're not sure, wait for a sale.  I have to say this is one game that watching streams didn't sell me on... I was on the fence for a while, even after watching plenty of footage.. but it looks and feels so much better in your hands for some reason.\n\nThank you Iga, and everyone who worked on this game!  It's fantastic.",Recommended

"Great so far. A bit anime-esque but this only becomes used for tropes in the story. As for gameplay, controls are BUTTERY smooth fam. We're talking symphony of the night but someone is continuously wrapping silk ribbons around your fingers while you play. Yeah. the game also has a very interesting ""heat map"" of needed buttons. No more a+b move right because of how over-leveled you are; there are stronger enemies mixed in with very well placed throw away enemies requiring creative uses of the main character's directional moves. This in turn requires a nice fluid choice in abilities. Resource management feels great and challenging. It looks like there may still be a need to potion spam some bosses but if you choose not to use potions even some of the earlier bosses take a very long time to kill; which is indicative that you needed to grind more. So its metroid with farming and grinding and crafting. If you didn't like any of the DS castlevania games you probably won't like this game.",Recommended

There is something here for people experiencing a SOTN style game for the first time without alienating old players. It's a MUST GET. 10/10 all day.",Recommended
"The gameplay is solid, soundtrack is awesome, buy it.",Recommended
"This is not only one of the best ""Igavania"" (Metroidvania with a specific RPG system, produced by Koji Igarashi), but one of the best games I've ever played.\n\nI will keep this brief. The sound is very good, the music is very good, but the voice acting is quite hit-or-miss. Some lines sound horribly read off of a card, other lines sound pretty decent.\n\nThe magic system is the beef of the game, in my opinion. It is fun to farm monsters to upgrade the ""Grade"" of your shards. You collect shards from killing monsters, and upon killing them again, you have a chance to upgrade the damage of your shard. It is fun to collect and experiment with these.\n\nOn top of this, it is fun to collect and experiment with all of the various scarves, rings, helmets, body armours and weapon types. There are Daggers/Rapiers, Swords, Katanas, Firearms, Greatswords, Greataxes, Spears, Staves, Special weapons like Flying Blade, Kick weapons, and more. You get ""techniques"" (special abilities) that you can use with specific weapon types or specific weapons. This adds another layer on to the combat.\n\nLeveling up is pretty straight forward - kill monsters, get experience, alongside that, you get random drops from a list specific to the type of monster, AND you have a chance to get shards. This fact provides a reason to want to kill every monster you encounter, instead of running like you would have been tempted to in Symphony of the Night.\n\nFor me, personally, the game has been pretty easy. I'm currently at 51% of the castle discovered and I've yet to have a challenging fight. They are fun and interesting, but overall really easy (for me). Others may find them more difficult depending on their load-out. It could definitely stand to have more difficulty, but this is only on normal. I haven't tried the harder difficulties yet, but I imagine the only difference would be the amount of damage received.\n\nOver-all, if you like Metroidvanias you will like this game. If you like to explore, collect, and experiment in combat, you will also like this game. This game is a fantastic experience and I would rate it a 9/10. It has its issues, especially with loot dropping on slopes - often being unobtainable as a result. That bug, and the voice acting, are the two reasons I rate it at a 9 and not a 9.5. I imagine the loot problem will be fixed in the future though.",Recommended

A Recommended Metroidvania and spiritual successor to the Castlevania games.,Recommended
"It’s been almost eleven years since Order of Ecclesia came out and since that time there’s been a Castlevania shaped hole in my heart.  None of the indie Metroidvanias in that interim have compared to my love of Ecclesia, SOTN, Portrait, and the Sorrow duology. So when IGA himself ran a Kickstarter for a spiritual successor to Castlevania because Konami would never let him make another one I jumped on backing that in a heartbeat. And I have to say what truly a fantastic Kickstarter this was. Kickstarter was always a gamble but the recent Epic Store shenanigans with Phoenix Point and Shenmue 3 (Which I backed but just for the game thankfully) has really poisoned the well further for Kickstarters and that’s a shame because Bloodstained proves that they can be done extremely well and can give you a game you could have never have gotten otherwise. IGA and his team delivered in spades, giving us not only this game but Curse of the Moon with the help of Inti Creates too and I couldn’t be happier.\n\nRitual of the Night practically picks up where Ecclesia left off, it plays just like the DS Castlevanias but has a bunch of QoL improvements, i.e. it has a customizable mini-map that has unopened chests marked, an expansive bestiary that list drop rate percentages (And drop rates feel more reasonable too), it actually tells you how to do the special attacks this time unlike SOTN, etc. There’s a bunch of equipment variety, even more so than the DS Castlevanias, and a good amount of equipment even shows up on Miriam. Bloodstained’s crafting also isn’t a pain in the ass which is a plus as someone who doesn’t tend to engage with that stuff in games. \n\nBloodstained also nails the atmosphere of the Metroidvania Castlevanias super well, it looks quite nice and the level design is just as good. The writing is solid for what it is and the voice acting is solid too. Michiru Yamane hasn’t lost her touch and the other composers like Jake Kaufman also help make the soundtrack great.\n\nNow that I have beat it I'd say that it definitely stays superlative throughout, there's a few rough edges like how you first have to deal with going underwater as well as the location of plot critical item, but ultimately it is fantastic. I only ran into one  gamebreaking bug early on in the game but that was it. I did run into some annoying audio bugs three times, one being after beating the final boss, but these are relatively minor things that can be patched.\n\nBloodstained is exactly what I wanted and it feels good to be finally back essentially playing a great Castlevania game again after a decade.  Every Castlevania fan and Metroidvania fan in general needs to play this game, it’s fantastic and definite GOTY material.",Recommended
"If you are a fan of Castelvania: ""Symphony of the Night"" or even of any Metroidvania games.... \nJust get this game !!!\nAlso if you have never played a game like this... ""Ritual of the Night"" is a great way to start with metroidvania-ish games.",Recommended
"(Currently playing on PS4)\n\nAs a kickstarter backer for this game, I couldn't be happier. As a fan of Symphony of the Night, Bloodstained hits all the right notes. The sound is great, the music is great, and the graphics are shockingly impressive. The weapons and abilities in the game essentially let you play however you want to play. Although progress seems to be fairly linear, the way in which you progress is up to you, and it feels liberating.\n\nIf you're looking for a very involved story, then you may want to look elsewhere. There's story to see, but if you've played Symphony of the Night then you know what you're in for, exploring a huge castle of sorts that at times can seem cryptic and mysterious, and daunting all the while.\n\nThere's an Easy, Normal, and Hard difficulties right off the bat, and Normal difficulty is actually rather ""normal"". After learning the basics, your own deaths will mostly be due to you taking big risks and making mistakes. There is no auto save, so save often, or pay the price.\n\nMouse/Keyboard controls get a pass from me. A controller is still your best bet, but a lot of times I don't feel like connecting a controller to my PC, and so I always seek out good Mouse/Keyboard controls. You can rebind it as you will, and it feels rather intuitive and thoughtful.",Recommended
IT GOOD,Recommended
This game is flucking sick\n,Recommended
The Graphic's did not match the videos the textures are very blurry and bland .,Not Recommended
"First impressions are quite positive.\n\nGameplay is fun, different weapons feel cool to use, a lot of stuff is very reminiscent of Symphony of the Night. Exploration is fun, which is probably one of the most important aspects on this genre. The soundtrack  and sound effects are great as well, keeping the tradition going.\n\nThe two biggest downsides for me so far are the really bad voice acting and the extremely ugly graphics. Not enough of an issue to detract too much from the overall experience, though, as they really aren't the focus of this type of game.\n\n[b]Addendum:[/b] Anything related to water on this game is really, really bad. Doesn't even seem like the same game.",Recommended
"Has some day one audio bugs, but the gameplay feels polished and nice. If you like SotN or Super Metroid or either of the 'of Souls' Castlevania games, this will feel right at home.",Recommended
Well worth the wait.,Recommended
Hot take of Bloodstained about two hours in: I'm enjoying it so much that I'm actually mad I didn't throw some $$$ into this during the Kickstarter phase. *shakes fist*,Recommended
"Bloodstained feels like the Castlevania game I've been waiting for. The combat and exploration is satisfying, the fixed and updated art was well worth the development delay and I'm already itching to play more. 40 feels a little steep for a price, but it's not too tough a pill to swallow considering the quality of the final product. \n\nhttps://youtu.be/l_jIjKOalOI",Recommended
"Brilliant game. Solid controls, beautiful soundtrack and fantastic graphics and animations. I was not an original backer but IMO this game would have been worth the rate.\n\nI did experience an issue with audio being consistently crackling but I fixed that but disabling voice effects for now. Voice narration is great but muting it doesn't affect my gaming experience. \n\nCan't recommend this game enough!",Recommended
"It's another Igavania! After all these years!\n\nThis game's real good. Controls feel great, not too floaty or weightless, level design is fun, lots of cool enemies, and fun RPG systems just like in the DS Castlevanias. There are a lot of throwback games trying to recapture the magic of a series, but this one really nailed it. Iga really does know what he's doing, or at any rate was able to hire the people who do.\n\nIf you have any affection for the old RPG-ish castlevanias, this is another one of those, 100%.\n\nOnly complaint so far is the font, which is boring and ugly, but that seems to be what Japanese devs go for these days.",Recommended
"This is the absolute last time I back a game. I can't believe it took this look to develop this game? It feels like a Chinese mobile version of Symphony of the Night. Clunky controls, clipping though walls, errors in the text window IN THE FIRST SCENE. Very disappointed.",Not Recommended
"As a die hard fan of the side scrolling Castlevania series from NES-SNES-PSX-GBA-NDS, this game delivers on every single front. It was everything that I'd hoped it would be and more. I have not been this happy to have a game in many, many years. I hope Iga makes many more Bloodstained games, I will buy them all.",Recommended
"$60 Kickstarter backer. I've played a couple of hours before I had to go to work, and I can say, it was worth every penny spent and every second in waiting.\n\nIf you're looking at this game because you loved games like the GBA or DS , you're going to be right at home, here.",Recommended
Very captivating so far. The controls feels good very responsive. Sound track is really good. Glad I backed this up.,Recommended
"Only played an hour but already digging it.  I'll update my review after I play some more, but right now just showing my positivity.",Recommended
Nothing wrong with it so far.,Recommended
"Something beautiful. If ever had played games like Castlevania, then this title is definitely for you.\n\n10/10 - Music\n10/10 - Voice Actors (David Hater - Snake from MGS)\n10/10 - Animations\n11/10 - Gameplay\n\n\n- A lot of:\n- Weapons\n- Armor pieces\n- Souls\n- Hidden walls\n- etc.\n\nThe game is definitely worth its price.",Recommended

The characters and art are fine, but the gameplay just feels so disjointed. It's so hard to pick out things from the background, and the enemies sometimes blend in to it as well. There seems to be a lack of polish on this game that I expected from IGA.\n\nI'm honestly not understanding the hundreds of positive reviews coming in for this game...",Not Recommended
It is just a must buy. That's all. <3,Recommended

However, Why can't I choose which language my text will be? (or can I?)",Recommended
"This is exactly what Iga's promised: a large, beautiful spiritual successor to his other works. Great music, moody art, and solid gameplay.\n\nA solid game, and the effort shows. Punishing, fun and well-paced.",Recommended
So this is my first review as i never know what to say but here goes. one of my favourite series of games are the castlevania games (original's not LOS) Especially i love symphony of the night and aria of sorrow and after playing a bit of this game i have to say it scatches the itch I've had for a game like SOTN and AOS,Recommended
Feels like Castlevania. That's all I wanted from it.,Recommended
"I kickstarted Bloodstained, so naturally, my expectations were ~lofty~! High as they were, they were met, and even surpassed.   Can't wait to see how insane speedruns of this game will be :D",Recommended
"I can't believe Iga made a Castlevania game without Konami. It even has the classic enemies, they just look different and have a new name.\nKonami is now obsolete and Castlevania is back. \nI love this game.",Recommended
"Good old Castlevania style game. Only played for a little bit, but I can already tell I am going to enjoy what is to come. And oh, the music. oooooh the music. So so good.",Recommended
"Got this as a gift.\n\nAbsolutely fantastic game. I'm probably gonna throw money for a Switch copy. \n\nA lovely Gothic art style, Lots of demons to fight, quite a lot of weapon variety, fun to play and explore and a great soundtrack all wrapped up in a 2.5D game.",Recommended
"This is sweet bliss. I find myself just stopping and admiring the colors and backgrounds. The music and artwork are splendid, this is what I was hoping for.",Recommended
"It's as great as I remembered IGAvania titles to be.\n\n1) Getting to places early by doing a second ""Double Jump"" mid-air after executing a downward kick on an enemy after the first ""Double Jump"".\n\n2) Performing 2 quick attacks in the small frame just before and after you land.\n\n3) Action cancelling using backdash.\n\nIs this as great as SotN? Maybe.\nIs this as great as AoS? Definitely.\n\nA must own for fans of the genre.\n\nWorth the 4 year wait.",Recommended
"If you enjoy Castlevania (metroidvania style), then you will love this game. Buy it!!\n\nAs of right now, I only have 8 hours of play time but my god this game is so much more than what I was expecting. Some of the NPCs look like they were underdeveloped graphically but the rest of the game is beautiful. Really captures the magic that was Symphony of the Night and then some! Exploring is a lot of fun.\n\nBreakable Walls 10/10",Recommended
"""I WILL PROVE THEM WRONG!""\n\nYou sure did Iga. A must play for anyone that is a fan of metroidvania games.",Recommended
Excellent!,Recommended
The game is a masterpiece Metroidvania worthy of it's title.,Recommended
This game rocks!,Recommended
"Great game, feels just like a lot of his classic Castlevania games. It's also stupid hard in a lot of places and completely unforgiving even on normal mode.",Recommended
"Castlevania with alchemical crafting and cooking? With stunning graphics and characters? \nSign me in!\n\nYes, it have flaws. English translation is sometime funny, sometime sad, balance and in-game help is a little bit out of touch (for example there's no explanation of what each stats affect). But it all could be fixed with patches and updates.\n\nP.S. Switch voice of the game to Japanese. English voices are bland and boring.",Recommended
"Start to play Castlevania when I was a child.\n\n20 years later, the whole game industry is different, and I am not that young any more..\n\nI might not be as curious as before in exploring new games, killing another boss, fighting against other players\n\nBut when I saw the picture and heard the music, I know I am willing to become a child again, even only for a couple of hours..",Recommended
"I've been patiently waiting for this metroidvania game for years now, and now that it's dropped, I think it was worth the wait.  It feels like a very nice blending between Order of Ecclesia and Symphony of the Night.\n\nThe controls feel very responsive.  The animations are nicely done (especially for some of the weapons like the whip!).  The graphics have been vastly improved since the beta, and makes the game feel more vibrant.\n\nBloodstained has some very handy options that should be standardized for metroidvanias, such as the ability to configure the position, size, transparency, and zoom of the mini-map!  Other touches, such as the ability to toggle visual trails on the map for travel history are also nice.\n\nProgression feels nice, the difficulty (at least on normal) doesn't feel frustrating, and collecting and upgrading of gear and shards (souls) doesn't feel tedious.  Bloodstained is definitely a game to pickup for those who enjoy fun platformers.",Recommended
"Guys, i'm like two save points into the game (not very far at all) and all i can say is WOW.  It's absolutely gorgeous.  And for anyone like me who loves a good Metroidvania, this appears to be the mother of all Metroidvanias.  This might actually be able to dethrone Symphony of the Night (though nothing, not even the same composer - which we have here - could beat that sound track) and Super Metroid.  \n\nIts absolutely bonkers how good this game feels to play.  I remember just loving controlling alucard in SotN.  Samus, not as much even though Super Metroid was an all time great for other reasons.  This has that same feel as controlling Alucard.  Combat is just fun. \n\nIf you're a fan of the genre, i'm not sure what you're waiting for.  This is the biggest no-brainer purchase of the year.",Recommended
Its pretty great.  If you like the castlevania metroid type of game I can't see you not enjoying this.  Glad I got it.  The game is fun as can be you can make cookies and craft weapons and items.  The bosses are fun and the voice actor for solid snake is in it.,Recommended
"Love it!\n\nbeen enjoying it a lot, highly recommend to Castlevania/Metroidvania fans!\n\nIgavania is back <3\n\nFull detailed review when I finish the game =D",Recommended
"Good fun!  The game plays exactly as I hoped it would, and I really enjoy the graphics.\n\nThe thing that really separates this game is the ""shard"" system. instead of the typical ""find X item that gets you through X obstacle"", shards are unlockable powers that work as both those special items AND the typical metroidvania powers - made even cooler by the fact you can aim them!\n\nIn terms of the ""glitchiness"" that most negative reviews I've seen are mentioning - the literal only one I've seen so far is that sometimes loot bags get stuck in mid-air, making them untouchable.  But come on.  The game is about killing monsters, and I'll get more loot.\n\nThe ONLY NEGATIVE thing that I have with this game is the amount of dialogue.  I think it shows incredibly effort that they've compiled quite so much dialogue (leaving the merchants has sparked a brand new conversation every time for me so far), but considering this is meant to be a spiritual successor to Symphony of the Night, I wish they'd just save the talking for the beginning, mid-point, and end of the game like they did with SotN.  But let's be real, at the end of the day I can just skip the dialogue - I honestly just wish there wasn't so much dialogue that I wanted to skip.  But for my only issue, it's really not that big of a deal, and the game itself is very very fun!\n\nIt's not SotN, but if any game since 1997 actually surpassed SotN, then we'd be comparing this Bloodstained to THAT game.",Recommended
No problem whatsoever on day 1.\nNeeds to be more difficult though.\nToo easy for castlevania fanatics.,Recommended
i have beaten it on normal and hard difficulty\nlove it\nit does have that Symphony of the Night feel to it\n\ncons: the game did crash for me when i first got it and alt + tabbed out\ni had to alt tab out a few times because i was streaming it\nbut i changed it to windowed and since then there have been no problems,Recommended
"Quite good! Scratching that metroidvania itch in a great way. For those that miss the old 2D Castlevania games, this is perfect!",Recommended
"Recommended sequel to the great castlevania's. It hits all the right metroidvania buttons. Secrets, fighting game moveset inspired skills, collectables, cool weapons and attacks. Also incorporates systems from the newer castlevania's like crafting and questing for cool bonuses.",Recommended
\n<squueeeee>\nI haven't felt this excited playing a Castlevania game since Symphony of the Night!\n</squueeeee>,Recommended
I have been playing this for about twenty minutes and I can already tell that this is/will be amazing:). Job well done on creating a great game folks. This brings back nostalgia and updates it for the modern age.,Recommended

very yes,Recommended
Love it but i'm f*cking lost in the castle i dont know where to go help xd,Recommended
"As backer and a long time Casltevania fan I was expecting great things. This is however not the case.\nShortly after the launching the game it without fail crashes before running for even a minute and a half (not even enough time to get past file selection.\nAll I can say is that I am greatly disappointed and until patches and fixes are made this is one game in my Steam library that is utterly unplayable. This is made even worse as I am decently above the minimum specs, and is laughable given the stated 'potato PC' minimum.\nOn a 1 - 10 scale I rate this a solid: 1 out of 10. Unplayability should never be an issue with a new game. I hope that given fixes and updates I can one day change this review, but as it stands I stick by my assessment.",Not Recommended
"If you love 2D castlevania, there is a good chance you'd love this as well.\nAlso worth noting the music is great too.",Recommended

"The gameplay is fluid and the music is really good. When creating a profile, enter the name NIGHTMARE (all caps) to unlock hard and nightmare difficulties right off the bat.",Recommended
"First, let me say, as an owner of about 500 games on Steam alone, I have never been inspired to write a review. This game (though maybe not perfect, so far has been damn close) captures the feel of one of the games that made video games a way of life for me. It is the well deserved follow up to Castlevania: Symphony of the Night that we never quite received. The feelings that came back to me in just the first hour of playing this game had been missing for so long that I felt I had to write a review just to pay homage to this games creators. \n\nThe controls are spot on.\nThe depth of the rpg elements are just right.\nThe art style is perfect for what I feel this game is trying to be.\nThe story itself is just as effective at capturing the feel of what Castlevania: Symphony of the Night was, as any of the other aspects of this game.\n\nThis game is good enough that I genuinely regret not supporting it on Kickstarter.\n\nSure, the voice acting is clearly that of a video game. I'm sure the graphics could have been more flashy, or realistic. \nBut I don't think this game could have created the feelings of nostalgia, and familiarity it did, if all of those things were done differently.\n\nThis game captures everything that I loved about Symphony of the Night, and improves on many aspects. I was not a backer but I could tell from the first trailer that the people making this game understood what made the Castlevania franchise special. This game (as well as Curse of the Moon) are a testament to the genuine knowledge of what makes a beloved game beloved. \n\nThis is not a game that would be capable by a company of old executives in suits calling the shots.\n\nThis game gives me hope that the tides of power in the game industry can shift, and massive companies shoveling cheap crappy games into a saturated market, won't always hold the power. At the very least it has proven to me that even if the name is different, the spirit of our favorite games can live on. This game was clearly made by people who know that you can only tell what makes a game good, by loving good games.\n\nThis company ArtPlay now holds a special place in my heart the same as CD PROJEKT RED.\n\nTo the people that made this game... Thank you.",Recommended

"[i]Metroidvania [/i]is my favorite genre; [i]Symphony of the Night[/i], [i]Aria of Sorrow[/i] and [i]Dawn of Sorrow[/i] are some of my favorite games. I had my doubts whether or not [i]Bloodstained [/i]could live up to [i]Castlevania's[/i] reputation, but I am now relieved to say that my doubt was misplaced!\n\n[i]Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night[/i] not only draws inspiration, but also expands upon the systems introduced in previous titles with additional weapon types, spell types, skills and customization options, all the while providing level-design and music rivaling the [i]Castlevania[/i]-series best entries.\n\nTo all fans of the [i]metroidvania[/i] genre, I highly recommend [i]Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night[/i] -- a worthy successor to [i]Castlevania's[/i] legacy!",Recommended
"Only 3 hours in , but the game looks and feels like Recommended next Castlevania. Great atmosphere, monster design and sountrack. A lot of skils and weapons and surprised amount of customization :)\n\nHopfully it will keep this level until the end, and it seems like we are getting a lot of support in future :)",Recommended
"If you liked Symphony or Dawn or Aria or just like MetroidVania's in general, buy this. The storyline is great, the action and upgrades are awesome and there are 3 different difficulty levels, so there's something for everyone. My GotY so far. (of course that's not saying much as this year has been horrible for games... but... yeah..)",Recommended
"Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night has, amazingly, lived completely up to expectations. It's the Castlevania game we knew we needed, but Konami didn't want us to have.  Koji Igarashi isn't trying to hide the fact that Bloodstained is a Castlevania game in all but name, and he doesn't have to. It's a heartfelt, authentic, beautiful Metroidvania game & i am so very happy with it.\n\nIf You like Castlevania then buy it without any hesitate. The Bottomline is this game is a Must have for a Castlevania Fan.\n\nMy opinion is 9/10.",Recommended

What an utter piece of crap! The game can't even get through the loading screen. After I select new game and select a save slot the game freezes on the loading screen.\nNever had a problem with any of my games on Steam and my rig is waaay above the recommended specs.,Not Recommended
"So far i love the game , its really amusing and enjoyable. but when the steam page had it up before release it for some odd reason said online and co-op, it would be weird but interesting if it did. Other than that it is amazing.",Recommended
"God I was scared with that one. The gameplay of the last backer demo I did was really making me feel like I would be so disappointed with the finished product. But the lighting was fixed, the gameplay made smoother, faster, maybe with slightly less frames of animations I don't quite know. Anyway if you were iffy on it like me during the development, I'm here to tell you that this game is actually good. \n\nThere are some references to older games that fans of igavania would be happy to see, without alienating people that are new to the style of this game. \n\nSo, whether you are a backer or not, I'm pretty sure you will like this game if you like metroidvanias. Even then, I barely scratched the surface and I keep finding new things to love. Like the down down attack combo of the lethal boots ♥ Ah. I'm so relieved. So yeah you can think me being a backer makes this review iffy, but trust me when I say I was going in with the most critical of eye after the versions I played up to now. Also I paid 60€ for a 40€ game and 10€ dlc 4 years ago, so you know.",Recommended
"Having followed this game over the years since it was announced from a distance (knew about it and the game that it takes inspiration from, but didn't actively take too much notice of it), I have to say that I don't see the hype.\n\nIts a typical metroidvania with some rpg elements like equipments stats. There is a crafting element to it too.\n\nPresentation-wise, its good but not great. the animations look pretty cheap to me. If it was a £15 quid indie title, I'd forgive it no problem, but we're talking near AAA price here.\n\nSome annoying technical issues too that I noticed. The conversation text boxes are bugged and more often than not result in words missing entirely. Example ""what the alchemists did was reshuffle our bodies"" had the word ""was"" missing. its not a typo or translative error either as after dying to the boss that followed that conversation, I was able to see it again and the text rendered correctly.\n\nAnother annoyance is the UE4 engine they chose to use. It (for me at least) resulted in frequent hitches both when entering new rooms and during camera angle changes in the cutscenes.\n\nThese are minor issues and should be easily fixed via patches, but as of right now, the game is a bit of a disappointment.\n\nWell its been a while now and the game has yet to see even 1 patch. Most likely down to the broken switch version taking priority. Having played further, I have to say that most of what I said still stands regarding the broken text, hitching etc (though as someone said in the comments, disabling framerate smoothing helps to a degree). The biggest gripe I have is the RPG mechanics are just an annoyance. Quests are also nothing to write home about.",Not Recommended
"This game feels so rewarding to play, learning all the mechanics and such, Feels clean af. Worth for sure",Recommended
The use of 3dcg still feels a little awkward but I can dress up in frills and look pretty while I wail on dullahan's with a great-ax,Recommended
"This is exactly what i was hoping for in a golden era Castlevania game.  An almost obnoxiously large area to explore, aggressive enemies that do more than just stare at you, and bosses that actually pose a threat.\n\nIf I had anything that I could consider a negative, its merely the sound volumes default to all maxed out, but that is so easily adjusted I can't hold it against the game.",Recommended
Excellent game. The wait for the kickstarter has been well worth it. Iga did it again.,Recommended
buy the game if you dont want to miss the fun the graphics are amazing and the price are perfect,Recommended
"Everything you want from a side-scrolling Iga/Metroidvania. \n\nIf your hunger for a worthy castlevania succesor isn't satisfied yet, this will be your prime buffet. \nStill recommended for everyone else who enjoys a side-scrolling action adventure. \n\nThere are some minor annoyances like a few glitches, performance dips in certain areas and slightly difficult controls but it doesn't take away from the fun. \n\nUltimately it's a very fun game, and that's what games are made for.

But Castlevania like.\nThe rpg elements are amazingly well combined with the castlevania style gameplay.\n\nAnd damn does the game have a nice artstyle.\nGraphics are good. Music is awesome, level design is fantastic atm.\nDifferent characters to unlock AND customize.\n\nMy god i'm happy that this turned out like this. \nIt deserves praise, it deserves the spotlight. And it deserves the sales its getting.\nWell done Koji Igarashi, Well done !!!!!\n\nEnjoy the game !",Recommended
"As a long time fan of the castlevania franchise, this is a familiar yet new experience. Graphically Bloodstained is beautiful with it's gothic look and touches of color. The gameplay has touches of SoTN, Aria & Dawn of Sorrow as well as Order of Ecclesia and Portait of Ruin. Overall I think it was money well spent, I believe I have fallen in love with the genre again. I highly recommend this title to newcomers and old heads alike.",Recommended
"While it's graphically impressive for a Igavania game and the music is a decent overall experience. Aria of Sorrow is still a better game.\n\n150$ well spent I guess. I really hope the post-game content provides what I need seeing as I've covered 25% of the map so far. And I don't think the pacing will sadly change.\n\nThe Negative:\n- Minimap is always zoomed out, and you have to manually zoom in each time you open it.\n- There's various places with avoidable monster damage going on which is annoying to the say the least. Double jump and other possible skills might solve that. Will update accordingly.\n- There's a bunch of stiff/out of sync animations in some instances or just a lot of freeze frames during certain scenes which seems to have just been added as padding for no reason.\n- Certain NPCs will get VERY annoying fast like the one who offer kill-quests which has the same one-liner every time. Jonannes/Dominique also has a line they have to repeat every time you're done bothering them. There's another one, a farmer that offers to grow your crops, sadly you can only do one seed at a time (gives x10). You can still outgrind places so I don't see how this might've been a good idea, especially on harder difficulties where this will become way more apparent + paired with good shards. I've you played anything like AoS onwards then you know the drill with souls already.\n- The entire map seems to borrow heavily from SOTN, AoS and OoE in terms of backtracking/layout with teleportation rooms spread a bit further away than any of the mentioned (except for SOTN for obvious reasons).",Recommended
It has the essence of Castlevania and more!,Recommended
"Not too far, so not a complete review. So far, I've been enjoying the combat, the controls feel pretty solid on a controller and are responsive. The monster types are varied and the attacks are telegraphed well enough to pick up on dodging, even for a mediocre castlevania type game player like me. The voice acting is pretty awesome, did well with the main characters for sure, and even the side characters are distinct. I like the crafting and the various needed items that you get from monsters, which makes grinding for shards also feel rewarding in the crafting department. A few things are buggy, like if you kill an enemy near some debris you wont be able to collect the drops, and had a drop through something without pressing buttons, and occasional casting of spells after exiting the menu. I'm not sure if I'm just an idiot, but it also seems to be impossible to see what the stats mean. I Kickstarted this game, and so far it's been worth it. Lets see how it goes the more I play it. Will revisit my review once I have more hours.\n\nEdit: After playing for 15-16 hours I can definitely say I love this game. The only poor implementation I've seen so far is that traps extend a bit past their animation in some cases. I found a few side areas that are incredibly challenging, so if you are looking for a hard fight, the game has those. The map is enormous, as of writing I have explored 80% of it. If I walked everywhere, I think it would take a minimum of an hour to get through from the galleon through the different points in the castle. All in all, glad I backed at the 60$ tier and feel I got more than my moneys worth.",Recommended

"This game is very addicting and offers a good challenge even on normal difficulty! If you're used to modern games taking it easy on you, prepare to see the game over screen a fair share of time.

And if a boss proves too tough, there's always time to look for more items or a quick level-up!\n\nIf you're a fan of SOTN, this is definitely a game you can sink your teeth into... Hey, where's everybody going?\n\nOne small imperfection: playing via Steam Proton in Ubuntu Linux, there is some (short) stuttering occasionally (loading in new level data?) and when quitting the game, there's an error message, where you have to kill the *.exe from your System Monitor.\n\nNothing major and I'm sure these minor bugs will be corrected soon, either by the game devs or Proton. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",Recommended
"i have played many igavanias. this one is amazing. this is finally an ambitious title that tries something new instead of, like many handheld igavanias, reusing old assets and mechanics. not saying they where bad, but this is the real deal. it looks amazing, it plays amazing, it sounds amazing. controls are on point. \n\nframerate is nothing to be worried of, i have a setup you could compare to the recommented one, mb a bit better and i have between 200 and 150 frames with a few exceptions.\n\nthe general gameplay loop should be famailiar to metroidvania fans:\nexplore, find stuff,  get the urge to go back and do something with found stuff in your starting area, finally find a tp or saferoom to do so, then upgrade your stuff and get on with exploring. its so satifying you will want to play on and on. \n\nthe bosses so far have been solid. most are not too hard, one was so easy that i was convinced i broke him somehow.\n\nmost enemy types have generally solid moves and some mixup. i also love the design. as said at the start of this review: finally no more asset copys from sotn. it feels so fresh and yet so familiar. \n\nmy only problem lies with some wonky interactions like the bosss ive mentioned, that just did nothing as i hit him, i think he was confused.\ngerman localization has some issues with missing gaps between words and some grammar and spelling issues\n\none time my game froze when i swapped weapons.",Recommended

This is an excellent continuation of what I would expect from one of the lead Producers of Castlevania...It scratches that itch I didn't know needed scratching until now! Great game all around so far!,Recommended
"This game is a brilliance of IGAvania formula. It has aspects of the best games of the Castlevania series, such as Souls-collecting system from Aria and Dawn of Sorrow, crafting, designs and some weapons resembling Order of Ecclesia, and of course, entire game is built in a similar fashion to Symphony of the Night. If you love Metroidvanias created by Iga, this game might feel like an epitome of this formula. It has everything a fan would want to have, including familiar demons and weapons. The soundtrack will not leave you indifferent, because it follows the beloved style of the previous Iga's franchise. Visually the game is perfect when it remains being a side-scroller, but certain cinematic angles may not be in the game's favor. Yet its artstyle, while objectively not flawless, still has a lasting power that may allow you enjoy this game regardless of the graphical advancement even in its own genre. I'm very happy that I have backed this game years ago, because I got what I wanted - a Recommended Castlevania successor. Long live Bloodstained&Iga.",Recommended
Brilliant.\nAs addictive as Symphony of The Night.\n\nand this is how Castlevania serie should be....\n,Recommended
"Look this is ultimately for and by fans of specific games, it doesn't really reinvent the wheel nor the games it's taking from, and in a sense I wouldn't even consider it its own thing entirely. \nIt lacks certain elements that would make it so, and I would've liked the game to do more to be its own thing, but the game is certainly fun and challenging enough, and the game certainly does make me want to play Symphony of the Night again. \nDon't get me wrong, newcomers will be able to play this and have fun with it, the game is hard but not that hard, and you can always grind your way to the top.\n\nThe game runs surprisingly well, I even forgot I was playing an indie game, when usually indie games run halfway decent or just ass, this game runs smooth without any real hiccups. There's no 60 FPS cap, the overall quality cap is surprisingly high,and it never feels like the usual Unreal Engine rodeo. It really does plays like a game that you would buy full price retail. \nIt plays like it sure, but the way it looks and the overall atmosphere do feel a bit unpolished at times. While for example the mouth movement during cutscenes has been improved, it still looks like the characters are lifelessly chewing a piece of gum, more than once my character was clipping through the wall so far in there I thought I had found a secret area, and many smaller grievances that won't spoil the game for you but are definitely noticeable annoyed me to no end.The sound effects on certain things is a little off, especially on enemies that don't really sound like you would expect, if even as enemies. The presentation just isn't up par with games like Symphony of the Night, and I wouldn't recommend this game for people looking for just that, this game is almost entirely gameplay, trying out different weapons, spells, and looking behind every nook and cranny for secrets items and areas.\nA lot of things look a bit greasy, effects look cheap at times, and sometimes enemies don't really resemble what they are supposed to be. It's not an ugly game by all means, it's just one that needs better presentation and story.\n\nI like the addition of shards, but not enough has been done with them to really make them memorable, and I tend to just pick the ones that do the most damage while throwing away the rest, which the game encourages but maybe shouldn't. I like the addition of visible gear, yet we're stuck looking at the same blue dress anyway (you can change its color) while everything else can be swapped out. I love the amount of weapons this game has, but just trying some stuff out is a gigantic risk because many weapons are not as useful as they should be while you can't always afford crafting them. Certain GUI options look a bit ugly, and certainly could use a bit more polish when it comes to ease of use, you'll often find yourself clicking through a list to choose every option when there should just be a button that chooses every option at once.\n\nUltimately it's one of the best SotN clones ever made, but it's no Aria of Sorrow, and with emphasis on the word clone. Luckily the price this game goes for is more than reasonable minus the ridiculous price for the DLC, so it's definitely worth picking up. Don't get the DLC however, it's just a single weapon and bossfight that don't really add anything to the game.",Recommended
"i'm about five hours into the experience at this time, so things can change.\n\nhowever, as a backer who's had hands on this game in various builds since alpha, the final release is a major major major overhaul, it's pretty now, the mouth animations don't hurt to look at, and the gameplay just feels RIGHT. \n\ni'm begging anyone that's a fan of the metroidvania genre, especially games like symphony of the night or aria of sorrow, please play this game, it's honestly worth more than what they're asking for it.",Recommended

"If you loved SofN (Symphony of the Night), you will love this game because it is just like it in every way. It has everything SotN had with extra additions that make it better.  The game looks gorgeous too. \n\nUsually, I buy games based on previous ones I've loved in the past.  Every time I do this, I get a sense of nostalgia that lasts for half an hour or so and then the game becomes boring and I stop playing.  I didn't think this would be any different, but I can't stop playing it. It's not the nostalgia that has me hooked either. The game is actually that good. This game is in fact the only game I bought all year that I have ZERO regrets buying. \n\nIf you want a 2d side-scrolling platform game like the older Castlevania games with stunning visuals and bits of RPG like features, GET THIS GAME ALREADY!",Recommended
"I'm less then an hour into this game, and I LOVE it. The echos of Symphony of the Night are obvious yet subtle. You can see and feel the Castlevania in this game, but it isn't overpowering. Iga knocked it out of the park with this and I can't wait to continue! The fact that Alucard's voice actor makes his acting chops known here makes me so very happy. Any fan of Castlevania should get this ASAP. I'm not sure how to use the other modes, like 2P and online and stuff, but I know it's there and I just haven't figured it out yet! Symphony of the Night was the first video game I ever played. It's also my favorite game of all time. This is amazing. So very amazing.",Recommended

This is the closest we'll ever get to a Symphony of the Night 2 and honestly, I'm perfectly fine with that. 100/10",Recommended
"So far I am loving the game, the control for keyboard and mouse work well.\n\nOnly difficulty starting out is normal but I personally think this is a good starting difficulty. The first two bosses (not including Boss Z-tsu) were pretty easy. and when exploring and finding new paths you may come across difficult bosses.\n\nPersonally after I managed to beat the first two shard bosses after the tutorial and the boss shown at one of the previous E3 events (tower boss). I probably went the wrong way and climbed the belltower as opposed to taking the photo for the train. Encountered the boss with the red umbrella and had a rough time but finally managed to beat her in my first go after depleting my healing supplies. This is the type of challenge I expect from a game and for anyone wondering if this game is too easy or is wondering if it will be challenging enough for them. My stance is that it is a challenging game for newbies and an acceptable challenge for people used to metroidvania type games.\n\n   That aside, this game is great fun and I highly recommend this game for anyone, just be sure to not be a dummy like me, and save your game every once in a while. I only had one game crash due to too many background. Aside from possible game crash be sure to save because there is not auto-save and you don't wanna be like me, the person who lost 30 minutes of progress because he died from stinginess. (Curse you my contemptuous greed, CURSE YOU!)",Recommended

"Seems overpriced, which is the main reason why I refunded it.\nIt also wasn't very fun from what I played. And the visuals left something to be desired (it's not ugly, just very plain). It's an indie game though, so I can forgive mediocre visuals. The problem is, the gameplay failed to grip me. I typically love Metroidvanias, but this was very dull.\nIt might be worth picking up when it's on sale for around $15-$20.... but, I know I won't be coming back to it.",Not Recommended

"Japan backer here.\n\nI was expecting to get the game soon, if not on release day, only to look online and hear that the Japanese release was delayed, and wondering why I didn't know before, found out after some digging that the announcement was hidden away at the bottom of what looked like a random fluff post on Kickstarter. Oh and the game has been delayed for us for, I quote ""months"": We don't even have a release date at this point. (Edit: Automaton Japan have asked the publisher and reported that they say it's been tentatively delayed to September, and this isn't even confirmed yet, it might be delayed even more! They also outright contradict the Kickstarter post saying that we WON'T get the download keys before the physical release)\n\nTo ""address"" this they're giving out Steam keys to backers, except that there are people like me who backed the game for console because we can't run it on PC. I gave it a try anyway and as expected, the game barely runs for me on the lowest settings and makes my hybrid tablet heat up to the point that I feel like it'd probably break or something if I kept the game running for more than five minutes. This of course is despite them previously claiming it would run fine on a ""potato PC"".\n\nBecause western distributors broke the street date on the game it's actually been in import stores over here for days, and people have played the NA version to find that Japanese language options are already fully implemented.  Since the game is fully playable in any language regardless of region it would be nice if they just provided console backers a code for another region. I tried reaching out to the Fangamer. 505 Games and Bloodstained accounts on Twitter to ask if this would be possible and got no replies at all. To add insult to the injury, they have been and still are replying to plenty of other people all this time. If they're unwilling to give out console codes I wish they could at least have the basic common decency to just say so instead of straight up stonewalling me. \n\nAnd meanwhile they're giving the game out to ""content creators"" on all platforms for free: https://twitter.com/Nelstar15/status/1141000464948842497\n\nThis is beyond disgusting.\n\nEdit: I'd like to add that I did eventually manage to get into contact with staff and found that, long story short, they had absolutely no intention of making this right.\n\n公式から引きずり出した情報等の進展はここにまとめてあります。\nhttps://togetter.com/li/1368107",Not Recommended

"Final impression:\n\nI have completed this game 100%. 0 crash encountered so far in my 39 hours of play time.\n\nVery good Metroidvania with depth and growing system. Really really good. Loving the wide weapon selection and EX skill and encourages the player to do something else other than rushing the story (cooking, exploring and doing side quest). \n\nEverything you have commited will be rewarded nicely.\n\nFrames are unlocked without messing with physics. Background detail is awesome. Character model might need polishing, blurry on qHD (dialog and menu). Hope they'll patch facial expression in as well and more wearable outfit. \n\nPerformance is best when play in full screen mode. Borderless fullscreen will get stutters.\n\nVoice acting is superb. You can feel the VA are enjoying their work. Especially Lindsay. \n\nMusic are well composed too. \n\nTL:DR: Good game with good music and well optimized on PC.",Recommended
"Graphic Design:\n\nThis is where the game kind of stands out, from other games I've played in the last 10 years or so. It's very distinctive, and there's a lot of attention to detail. From the character design, to the monsters, all of the backgrounds, they all feel very lush and memorable. One of my biggest criticisms with the game when it was in beta was that it looked dull, and washed out. A lot of issues with lighting, and just the backgrounds being generic and boring looking. This I was the happiest seeing improved. The animations all look really neat, both for the monsters and for Miriam, but it's not too convoluted. I know there are 3 playable characters, so this is just on Miriam. \n\nSound Design\n\nOne of the reasons SoTN is one of my favorite Castlevania games is because of the music, and this game has excellent music. The title song, the Galleon, and the Village so far all have really good BGM. The sounds from the weapons, monsters, Miriam, etc all fits well.  The voice acting is amazing, I've been playing in English with Japanese voices, and it's truly remarkable. There's a couple monsters that sounds kind of silly when they die, but that's probably my only criticism of the sounds design. \n\nGameplay\n\nWeapon variety is great, and some weapons have hidden abilities which increases the depth. There's a lot of shards, allowing for a very varied sets of loadouts. This helps a lot when moving around the big areas. The galleon, the village, and then the castle. The areas are really big, this game is probably going to be insanely huge. Just 1hr in, and I'm not even at the castle. What's most impressive is how well designed the areas are. There's hidden things, and to get to some places, you have to get a bit creative. I appreciate that a lot.\nMisc\n\nThe game does a pretty good job at pacing the story, making the unraveling of what's going on more fun. Specially once you get to the castle. I feel like this was something that only a few castlevania games did well, like order of ecclesia. I like that lot, it makes me want to play it more.\n\nSo far, it's a brilliant 9/10, but i feel like the length of the game, how the story unravels, and the amount of content there is at the end will bring that up a point higher.",Recommended

Good use of PBR but nothing too fancy, visually it does its job.\nMovement is a bit sloppier than its spiritual ancestors, perfs are pretty bad for how simple it technically is.\nShaders and animations are a bit on the meh side (especially some animations that have completely linear keyframe tweening, having these on Miriam really gives off an amateurish vibe).\nAlso I imagine/hope it will be fixed soon, but for me whenever Miriam speaks, all audio channels start stuttering and the framerate drops. I'm sure she's fluent in eldritch because she breaks the universe whenever she opens her mouth.\nCharadesign's a step up from most little pile of secrets games. Miriam is cute but her personality is too bland. Zangetsu, Alfred and Domi are really cool. Also Zangetsu is voiced by David Hayter. Yes, Solid Snake hunts demons now.\n80% of the difficulty resides in the bossfights, the rest is mostly a cakewalk. If you've played Curse of the Moon bosses are about the same difficulty.\nOh and the french localization is completely f⚝cked. Font spacing, wrapping & height are monkey-tier. So yeah, play in English.\n\nA good buy so far, if it keeps the same level of content and quality until the end it'll be well worth the 40 bucks.",Recommended
Marvelous game.,Recommended
"Did you enjoy SotN?\n\nThen you'll love this game. It's probably one of the best, if not the best, Metroidvania on the market right now.",Recommended
"Only a few hours in so far, but this absolutely lives up to what i was hoping for. The feel of the gameplay perfectly matches what i would hope for out of another golden era Metroidvania, and the artwork and animations look lovely. Might not look as flashy or polished as some modern releases, but it has a charm that harkens back to classic ps1 and GBA titles that this is based on.",Recommended
Excellent that's all i gotta say.,Recommended
olayed it for 30 ish minutes and it was kinda fun the animations are good the character moves well the cuscenes are great even though they have alot of awkward pauses but it just isnt a game for me. I recommend it for everyone who likes metroidvania style games.,Recommended
The Recommended successor to Castlevania series.,Recommended
Good game that adds some improvements to an already proven formula. Game looks and sounds amazing; and all the weapon types I've used have felt very distinct and serves a purpose.\n\nHas lived up to the promise of the Kickstarter for me; and I'd recommend it to anyone wanting to play another great Metroidvania.,Recommended
Totally Worth It!,Recommended
Money well spent,Recommended
"Having played a lot of Castlevania, but not all (""Symphony of the Night"" for example), I can say this game is a spiritual successor without a second thought. This game is fun and captures everything I loved abou SotN:\n-cheesy dialog\n-great music\n-fantastic backgrounds and scenes\n-fun gameplay\n\nAdditionally:\n-crafting (not nesseccary as far as I can tell, but makes things a bit easier)\n-Missions (again, optional)\n-Magic through shards\n\nWhat I miss:\n-A weapon or shield for the other hand (why do I have to chose between sword or gun?)\n\nI'll add upon this with further progression.",Recommended
"This is my edited review after playing the game for several hours and making it through to see what all the game has to offer on launch.  While the extra dlc modes are still on the way that will be free on release, the game is still much enjoyable though you can only play as Miriam for now with Zangetsu later and a 3rd mystery character not revealed as of this review.\n\nThe game is FUN.  There is lot of different weapons to choose from and like over 100 shards to use.  There are also many different cool accessories, armors, hats, etc to wear as well.  Hats will actually show on the character as well as certain accessories.  Sadly, the armor does not change her looks, but.... there is a nice little surprise when you get little ways into the game so look forward to it.\n\nThe game does have lot of optional quests that you can complete and I highly recommend you doing them because they do offer some nice rewards half the time or at least offer something you can at least sell, but you probably want to hold on to lot of stuff since this game has alchemy.  With alchemy, you can create stuff and there is no fail chance so do not worry about that.  After you have first created an item, it will show up in the general store list meaning you do not have to go out your way to farm all the materials again long as you have the gold to pay for it.  There are ways to reduce the cost of things, but many ways to make more money and faster with one of those ways being very very overpowered but cuts off the grind time by huge margin once you discover it.  I also want to point out how cool it is to see your powers evolve as you increase their grade and rank.\n\nThe music, sound, and graphics are all wonderfully done and I would not have it any other way as it feels so well done and nothing more I can say about it.  You can see for yourself with all the positive reviews and cool videos out there, though you may want to avoid videos if you want a spoiler-free run.\n\nThe game is not perfect though.  There is a few issues that could be fixed but there is one that requires good memory that cannot be patched.  What I mean is if you are bad at remembering stuff, you probably want to write down notes or something because the hints given out throughout the game are not repeated by the NPCs.  There are some notable bugs as well that are few spread out of various things, but I feel that the community is doing their best to get these things reported.\n\nOverall, I am very happy customer and yea, the game definitely gives that Castlevania Symphony of the Night feeling back and love every moment of it.",Recommended
"Bloodstained is exactly the game I had wanted it to be. Perfect successor to Symphony of the Night, Aria of Sorrow, and the best of the 2D Metroidvanias.",Recommended
hot,Recommended
"An outstanding spiritual successor to the Koji style castlevania games, heavily resembles dawn of sorrow, order of ecclesia, and SotN in particular.\n\nAlucard's voice actor is in the game\n\nS tier soundtrack as always, this was indeed worth the wait",Recommended
"First Impressions: Has the soul of Symphony of the Night, that being said it does not have ultra wide support but i'm used to that you might be able to go through the files and rewrite it to have that. The graphics look great i've seen some people with complaints about that they must have other issues with they're hardware i dunno i'm running this on a 1070ti and Ryzen 1700x and its smooth i haven't had any glitching like other have complained of either. I know i don't have much time in the game yet but i can tell that the game is going to be gold overall. Take this review with a grain of salt in bias towards metroidvania games in general. I sure with other issues that other complained of they'll be patched i think the game is well worth its price you can get it on sale on Fanatical for 33.99 i believe it was. Id highly recommend a controller as well for this game. P.s. graphics don't make a game the game play and story do and so far so good. Now i have to get back to my game i figured id share my impressions about the game thus far ill update accordingly if something does change.\n\nI've only ran into one glitch and its when you walk into the castle as it says welcome rather large on the screen the audio did glitch out but only for a second other then that its been solid.\n\nupdate:\nran into one more glitch after getting the double jump i went back to the ship to complete the map portion there is a room where you can adjust a box to get to higher ground the noise the box produces when you move it is automatically stuck in a sound loop not a big deal but just and fyi on what i have encountered.\n\nI'm 5 hours in or so and can say that this game is well worth its full asking price but you can grab it on sale off steam, gog and fanatical, fanatical being the cheapest I've seen it i think around 31 USD,\n\nupdate: \ndecided to buy a new monitor cause i wanted a higher frame rate then i had i went with a 1440p 144hz monitor this game supports it and it looks amazing. If your a fan of Castlevania this game is for you.\n\nupdate:\nim now more then 70 percent finished with the map, the game is well worth it, it can have some small issues like if i slide into a small area it gets stuck from time to time but you can get unstuck. I've spent a lot of time just looking for secret rooms etc im sure i could have beat the game by now but im enjoying my time with the game.\n\ncompleted 99.80 of the map i cleared the game already got to go back for fight O.D. still.\nthe game is worth its price if this is the style of game you like, dont over look it if your a fan of castlevania etc.",Recommended
get this if u love SotN,Recommended
A visually stunning game with a great soundtrack. The game play is fun and challenging. A fantastic game so far.,Recommended
"So far, this game has been quite fun and enjoyable. The gameplay is very similar to Aria of Sorrow, and feels really nice. If you're looking for another metroidvania game, you've found one. The soundtrack has also been fantastic so far. I have two complaints about the game so far, and that's the visuals and some of the sound effects. The visuals don't always look so hot, but it's not going to ruin my experience. I can't say that for everyone though. The sound effects are also a little wonky sometimes and can't be heard over the music. It's definitely disappointing that it doesn't look as good as some older Castlevania games, but it feels really good to play.",Recommended
"The following review has been revised, as my initial misgivings were largely based on my on flawed misconceptions and ignorance. The original review is contained within the asterisks, with the revision following.\n\n*  *  *\n\nhttps://youtu.be/yQvloubEVPo\n\nPlease be more specific about what qualifies as a potato PC in the future. Less than half a line of dialogue can actually be understood here. I'll try it on my desktop soon to be sure, but so far I'm not very optimistic. My laptop doesn't meet the specs, but the potato descriptor was the initial system requirement listed when the game was purchased. I'd be happier if the game were optimised further because I really can't enjoy it like this.\nIt seems pretty good from what I've seen though. I won't be refunding this or anything, because I'd still like to play it and I do like pretty much everything I've seen. It just doesn't run for me. It'll probably be fine for a lot of people though.\nThe lack of recommendation isn't due to the game's quality, just my unhappiness with its current requirements. By all means, get the game if you meet them and want to play a Castlevania game. I'm happy to support the studio and hope they provide patches to reduce the requirements in the future.\n\n*  *  *\n\nSince someone said it would be helpful, here are my laptop specs.

"For me Symphony of the night was amazing. Top 10 video games of my life amazing. Art, music. Its flaw was the game being so damn easy even toddlers can complete it.\n\nBloodstained has a ""love it or hate it"" art. I'm not a big fan of the 3D feeling but it's alright. I was turned off by the looks initially but I ended up liking it.\n\nThe music isn't as great as SOTN's but it's good nonetheless, and there are a few songs that are on SOTN levels good.\n\nGameplay-wise, however, is the SOTN formula improved. This is where the game shines. It's pure LOVE and it's what keeps me going. It has so much stuff to do and more. The metroidvania formula, pure, simple and fun.\n\nHighly recommended.\n\n\nNow, avenge the dead Castlevania franchise by punishing Konami.\n\nKILL THOSE MURDERERS DEAD! And buy this game!\n\nNote: If you're experienced with Castlevania games, at the start of the game write ""NIGHTMARE"" as your file name and choose [b]Hard[/b] instead of [b]Normal[/b].",Recommended
"This game is essentially the Castlevania series continued under another name...however, there is an element of special moves that add an additional dimension. Different weapons can have different special moves. For instance, knife weapons have a special move where you throw a powerful magical knife across the screen via a specific button input sequence (similar to fighting games.) Whereas say with katana type weapons, you can utilize a deflection technique that operates like 'parry' in Dark Souls, as their special move. \n\nIn any event, the game seems to have a bit more dimension to it than traditional Castlevania while overall maintaining the same feel. Controls are pleasantly smooth and responsive (refreshing after dealing with the built-in input delay lag of Dark Souls III.) \n\nI recommend it.",Recommended
"Its a solid Castlevania successor 10/10 all i could ask for. doesn't try to do anything ""new"" or ""innovative"" like all these modern shit shows we call AAA games. Its a breath of fresh air to see something like this made in 2019.",Recommended

"So far, so good. While the presentation is a bit wonky, the game plays like a classic metroidvania complete with a soul collecting mechanic similar to the DS Castlevania games.

"I haven't played any Castlevania games but I have played Metroidvania games like Hollow Knight, Axiom Verge, etc.  I haven't really enjoyed them too much I'm not too sure why but this game is really fun to play. \n\nPros: Fluid controls, big weapon variety that all play different, good crafting system, multiple difficulties, good spacing between save rooms, music, fully voiced, fun boss fights, different accessories that change the appearance of your character like helmets, hair accessories, rings, etc. (elf ears hnnng)\n\nCons: Some rooms and areas look amazing in the art-style and others look bland and boring, when you change clothing it stays as the same dress",Recommended
This is basically an unofficial Castlevania game made by the director that made Castlevania Symphony of The Night. I love it!,Recommended
"A very highly recommended modern classic game. Everything in this game is good. Gameplay, controls, EXP system, inventory, music, graphics... Even the price of this game is really good! So far the only bad thing I encountered about this game is it is so good, it's very hard to quit. I still need to go to work later and I should be sleeping by now but instead this game kept me awake. I'll just have a very strong coffee tomorrow in the office so I can function well.",Recommended
"Excellent game, tight controls, super music and awesome graphics BUT ! be very careful of reading the bookshelfs to learn the techniques, they frequently crash the game. Other than that, worth every penny",Recommended
"Backed this one Kickstarter ages ago. Sometimes I wondered if the long development cycle meant the game just wasn't up to snuff, or if IGA had somehow lost his magic touch.\n\nI'm happy to say that the game is everything I wanted it to be. The 2.5D effects look gorgeous, and I'm having a blast! It's like the perfect blend of Symphony of the Night and Dawn of Sorrow. Highly recommended for any Castlevania fans.\n\nIGA's still got it!",Recommended
"I'm so glad I backed this, it has just about everything you'd need and more in a Metroidvania style game, and seeing as how it was my by the grand daddy of the genre himself, that's not surprising. Loads of secrets and small details everywhere, surprisingly deep character customization (once you reach a certain room), loads of different weapons with different speeds, recovery, reach and special moves (and even a equipment set shortcut wheel...once you reach a certain room), drops from enemies for crafting and spells, or rather ""shards"", New Game+, multiple playable characters, sidequests, a beautifully orchestrated soundtrack..., I can go on.... The only negative is that you may find this a little hard on the eyes in certain places, but it shines so bright everywhere else that I really don't care, personally. As of the time of this review, there's quite a bit of free DLC coming this games way by the way of Kickstarter stretch goals that were funded, so there will be reasons to dive back in later. If you played SOTN, any Castlevania game after it or the tons of games inspired by them, try this. You won't regret it.",Recommended

"So far so good, haven't spent that much time in the game but I like it so far. Sadly I haven't played other Castlevania games and this is my only first taste of Igarashi's Igavania style game. At first jumping for me was weird but it took some time to get used to it.\n\nPros:\n+ Updated graphics\n+ Smooth controls\n+ Interesting story\n+ Character customization (would be good if characters appearence could change with new armor he/she equips)\n+ Marvelous soundtrack\n+ Branching questline\n+ Decent game difficulty\n+ Plot twist\n\nCons:\n- Haven't found anything to dislike apart from coin falling through the ground :P\n- Grind for dishes and other items is insane.\n\nCrash Report:\n\nFound a bug where in Towers of Twin Dragons you enter a tower and on the inside there is a bookshelf. When pressed on it game crashes and turns off with a message fatal error.\n\nIf I don't press on the bookshelf everything is fine.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nUPDATE:\nWhat a game, haven't been drawn to something like this for years. Yesterday played this gem from morning 'till this day morning. SPOILER ALERT!!!\n[spoiler] Got a Carpenter's Key and this guy was more challenging than Dark Souls. Room is small and not a lot of space to move or dodge. Plus the boss itself has a very well programed homing projectiles, if you stand at a specific spot and then jump you are 100% guaranteed to be hit by his knife. But after 3 or 5 deaths I managed to exploit the system where you can pretty much beat the AI and it wont be able to hit you nor target you and all you have to do is upgrade Aqua Stream Shard and buy lots of MP potions for skill spamming. With this exploit it took me about 5 to 6 min to beat his 7k or 8k HP (can't remember). [/spoiler]\nAfter that boss fight I went to beat [spoiler] Zangetsu [/spoiler] with no potions. I thought this will be easy but boy oh boy I was wrong. Igarashi lived up to my expectations with the game's difficulty. Took me about 20 or even more tries to beat him but at that point I stopped counting all I wanted is to beat it and go to sleep. My friend over the Skype was telling me to stop and just give up and try next morning but I pushed my own limits and managed TO GO... EVEN FURTHER BEYOND! AAAAAAAAAA!!!!!! (DBZ reference English dub). After that I felt the biggest satisfaction ever, at last moments I was at a breaking point where I would even break my own tech. This just shows how much more difficult game can be if you only run bosses without potions and other items that augment your stats. This game is Igarashi's mastercrafted game of all time (for me personally).\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nUPDATE Nr. 2:\nFinally finished this masterpiece everything is on 100%, sadly did not get 100% of games achievements needs a second run, but atleast I can take it easy with NG+. Thank you Koji Igarashi for this breathtaking experience!",Recommended

"Putting in my two cents after an hour of gameplay. Game seems great to me, and what a relief that is. Exactly what I wanted after completing Aria in Retroarch on mGBA recently. I blew that game up with a CRT filter on my 42 inch, and for all the crap this game is getting for graphics, they redid a lot of stuff and it absolutely looks pretty damn good now. I am actually happy they went with the 2.5D look. It's something new. And with the success of this game it will only be improved the with the next one.\n\nI don't have any major issues. They blended the characters and the backgrounds about as well as they could. Locations look fairly detailed with secrets, things to break, and immersive lore. On 4K and Epic settings the game plays extremely well for me on my rig. No drops or anything. The lighting is fairly good for a game like this on max settings. They have redeemed themselves from the very pedestrian early builds.\n\nThe voice acting actually surprised me. It's pretty well done, and a lot better than any game Iga has done before this. The English voices have a British vibe that doesn't sound too corny or verbose. It just blends well with the atmosphere. The story might not be great, but it's a lot better than the SotN days. Well done in that regard so far anyway.\n\nGameplay seems really solid. There are a lot of things you can do with shards and weapons, and I always felt like the movement was smooth as well. The whole thing comes off as a really nice evolution of the Igavania model, and I could not have asked for more as a backer. \n\nNIGHTMARE on the save file unlocks all the difficulties, and Hard mode feels absolutely great and is where I recommend decent gamers should start.\n\nAll together this project came out extremely well in the end. I'll be updating the review as I go along.",Recommended
"So now that I'm almost through my first 100% run of the game I'd like to share my experience with it.\n\nTLDR: It's awesome. If you love Iga's previous works, you're gonna love this one as well.\nIf you haven't touched a Castlevania before: you're gonna like it, if you like Metroidvanias. This means: Backtracking; repeatedly slashing monsters and/or jumping and running around collecting things to make you stronger.\n\nDetailed Review:\nI've never played Symphony of the Night due to the lack of a Playstation of any kind. \nBut I've played through Harmony of Dissonance, Aria of Sorrow, Dawn of Sorrow, Portrait of Ruin and Order of Ecclesia multiple times.\n\nGraphics: Although I really have a knack for the pixel art style of the above mentioned games and I miss it to the fullest, Bloodstained's new 3D graphics in the Unreal Engine look really gorgeous too. There were quite a few places I just stood there and looked at effects or the composition of rooms. Everything fits well together, there's nothing I could complain about.\n\nMusic: Simply put, the OST is amazing. I'm definitely gonna get it soon. Though I have to admit, after roughly 20 - 30 hours of play some pieces started to annoy me a bit. Whilst in a casual playthrough this might not have happened, while grinding for 100% completion this might be a thing.\n\nSound: I'm not able to say much about SFX. Some suprised me and made me laugh, but I didn't notice anything bad in particular.\n\nVoice Acting: This might've been because my hardware isn't up-to-date but Miriam's voice crackled sometimes in dialogues or while fighting. Other than that... I like that there's the option to choose between english and japanese. My playthrough was with the english version and it was okay. You can hear the difference between main characters and side characters. \nUsing the same shards again and again results in hearing the same lines again and again which can get quite annoying, but you can lower or turn off the voices, which helps in that case.\nNow that I think about it... hearing ""JONATHAN! CHARLOTTE!"" a whole game might be better than hearing ""Arise! Me and my shadows!"" in every room.\n________\nThe following are some additional opinions I wanted to write down, in case anyone of the devs might read this review.\n\n- Somewhere I read an article that stated that Bloodstained will be more than double the size of any of Iga's games up till now. I don't know which parts of the game this refers to, but I feel that this is not Recommended. The full map feels kinda small, compared to what I have in my memory of the older games I played. The whole game felt kinda short. Also I'm pretty sure there have been Castlevanias with more bosses or monsters in general. \n      - But there is quite a number of equipable items, bonus points for that!\n\n- I love that many equipable items have visible graphics on the character. That's an awesome feature. It just kind of saddens me, that, when I want to give Miriam certain styles, I have to live with a decrease in her stats. This reminds me of ""Fashion Souls"".\n      - That barber NPC for character customization is a great addition! Love it!\n\n- I feel like there are a lot of useless empty rooms in Bloodstained. If there's already an area transition room like in the old games, there's no need for another one or two screens filled with empty rooms aside of it. \n\n- I really like the idea of quests in a Metroidvania, but herein they are just way to repetitive.\n\n- If there'll ever be another Metroidvania by the team behind Bloodstained: What about a lovecraftian/cthulu-esque setting? I feel like you could nail that very well!",Recommended

"An ABSOLUTE beauty of a game. Koji's pulled it off! The game's well built, plays like one would expected from a Castlevania, and for what the reputation of kickstarter games tend to be? This game pulled off something of a welcome change of pace. \n\nPros: \n- Expansive map with all the twists and turns of your typical iga-vania, plus some additional shifts to gameplay. \n- Amazing soundtrack that may make your reminisce of previous iga-vania titles; I personally love the way string \ninstruments were used here. \n- The ""Shard"" system will feel familiar with players who have played Castlevania titles such as Aria of Sorrow\n- Amazing level of detail, proving that Koji keeps his word when given feedback about the graphics. Equipped Accessories are also VISIBLE; something that few igavanias have really pulled off up to now, if any. \n-  Combat feels smooth and fluid, with some new and interesting twists to familiar weaponry. Players will be pleased to see that some old techniques from the DS era of igavania are still present. \n- A wellspring of content soon to come to the title ensures that gameplay will stay fresh for a long while. \n\nCons.\n- Kinda hard to say....there are a few minor mishaps here and there with voice lines extending past written dialogue, and a couple\ngraphical errors, but it doesn't damage immersion that much as far as I've seen. Sometimes text can also extend down the window, without allowing you to scroll back up. (Tested with steam controller)\n- There are a few rare cases where the FPS will drop for a couple seconds; this is mainly after dying though, and will usually pick back up. \n\nLittle tip; if you can, set all your graphics settings to ""Cinematic"" as it seems the lower graphics can exclude quite a heavy amount of detail. \n\nThis review is partially based on gameplay footage a day prior to release, alongside a few hours of gameplay post-release to check things for myself.",Recommended

"THIS is what I was hoping for. Iga has combined mechanics and elements from all his games (even the PS2 ones) and mixed them all into a perfect cocktail of Castlevania loveingness. Gameplay is addictive, controls are perfect (please use a gamepad), music is phenominal, graphics are very good, map design is huge without being overhwelming, game's flow is natural, story is interesting (with surprisingly good performances) and there are thousands of combinations of monster abilities and weapons at your disposal. This is legitimately a great game.\n\nI'll also say most metroidvanias on Steam don't do the formula right. They all have zoomed out playing fields (causes motion sickness for me, makes gameplay feel slow) and use Souls style hack n slash combat which Igavanias never had (also slows gameplay). Luckily Iga was behind this game so the attacks are the same as they've always been: single attack animation for each respective weapon type and the ability to cancel your attack animations with jumps and back dashes. PERFECT!!\n\nIf you're a hardcore CV nerd, a casual CV player or someone who just like metroidvanias this is probably the best one on Steam and especially on GOG which lacks the genre (and THANK YOU Iga and 505 for keeping it off of the cancerous Epic store despite using Unreal).",Recommended
"Pros\n+ As addictive as Symphony of the Night.\n\nCons\n- My only main issue with the game, and its a big one so far, is the attack animation getting cancelled when you initiate an attack and you're about to land. It's common issue with UE4 animation blending but can easily be fixed.\n\nBottomline,\nI'll recommend this game once this issue is fixed.",Not Recommended

This is exactly what I was hoping for. Iga-vania lives on.,Recommended
"30 years of playing games i spent the last few years struggling to find anything that can hold my attention. I am glued to this! it is SOTN 2, best game i played in a long long time. The level of detail and animation in the characters is amazing and the music just takes me back to those days of coming back from school and burning my youth away",Recommended
"After 75 hours in it, and having done literally everything there is to do in the game for the moment I guess I can write an review a bit more complete.\n\nFirst off, let me just start by saying that I absolutely love this game, it's my personal GotY, even though I can see that it can't really compete with this years' behemoths. I'd easily recommend this game to anyone, it's plenty of content and quality for its price tag, and it delivered what was promised in the Kickstarter campaign.\n\nSo let me start with the obvious downsides, if any of these two is a dealbreaker to you, your experience is going to be vastly inferior.\n\nThe biggest offender in this game is definitely the cutscenes. The lip syncing is off, the walk cycles are janky, the animations are stiff. It's not that ""endearing"" kind of bad either, it looks painfully amateur, it's just ugly to look at. Maybe if they went with 2D cutscenes or just ditching it altogether and make all dialogue and actions through in-game actions and text-boxes with a picture it wouldn't be an issue, but as is those are just completely impossible to overlook or defend. Granted, there's not much cutscenes in this game, but whenever it does it's guaranteed to be bad. \n\nThe second is visuals, the artistic design is great, this definitely looks the part of a gothic-themed plataformer with the Castlevania-like quirks. There's some pretty genius use of 3D too like enemies springing from the background, blood spatter hitting walls and some other gimmicks I won't spoil here. But the overall package it's not quite there yet. The graphics just aren't pretty to look at, and I'm not talking about photo-realism or expecting a AAA level of details. In fact, any Castlevania from SotN until Ecclesia has a better presentation than Bloodstained, and those are low-res games. Mind you, I'm not saying the visuals are bad, I'm just saying it doesn't feel quite as authentic and genuine as other Igarashi's works do. It's hard to explain exactly why, but it's a feeling I couldn't shake off through my play time.\n\nI also thought the OST in this game would be far inferior from previous Iga's works because at first most songs just sound like SotN covers, but the more I played it the more I liked it. The second half of the game has some truly great songs, stuff that felt completely fresh and still the level of awesome you'd expect from it. I didn't bought the soundtrack at first, but I did today, and there's some tracks I just can't stop listening to. ([url=https://youtu.be/r5U9toBDqOo]Moonlight Nocturne[/url] still reigns supreme in my song list though)\n\nFor the rest, everything is what you would expect. Sharp controls. Epic boss fights (and others not so much). An absolute reliance on exploration. Non-linear progression. Variety in weapons design and spells. Some new mechanics along with some timeless classic ones. A few easter eggs to reminisce the old times and some new ones to have you guessing.\n\nA perfect blend of sharp plataforming with engaging RPG elements. If that sounds appealing to you, then this game is definitely worth it.\n\nOh, as a finishing note, I see tons of discussions surrounding this game's difficulty. The only real valid criticism is locking the Hard and Nightmare difficulties behind a special code, they should've been available upfront. The rest is pure nonsense. This genre of game can be as difficult of easy as you like. Use said weapon, don't use said weapon. Farm XP or items, rush straight to the next location. Exploit weaknesses, use whichever you feel confortable with. There's tons of different approaches, each with they own experience. That's the beauty of it!\n\nPS: Metroidvania is a stupid name to reference this genre. Fite me.",Recommended

"This is straight-up one of the most beautiful masterpieces I have ever had the privilege of playing after being starved of Igavanias for so long.  Lovingly crafted by Koji Igarashi and his team including Michiru Yamane who wrote the music and Ayami Kojima who's done art for past Castlevanias under his leadership, this game delivers in so many more ways than I thought possible.\n\nFor Symphony of the Night fans you can expect to see several callbacks and references, including a oh-so familiar looking character with an oh-so familiar voice actor behind him, if only the colors were a bit different...   Not to mention several parts where I simply found myself going, ""Oh, of -course- they would put that in this game"", from the 'bad ending' to a particular boss fight to even harassing a poor man who just wants to have a seat.  \n\nFor fans of the GBA and DS Castlevanias you can expect to see the return of the soul collection from Aria/Dawn of Sorrow, rather extensive crafting pools, and a gigantic bestiary to fill out that documents all of the enemies you discover and what items/shards they all drop as you discover them.  \n\nFor fans of Metroidvanias in general, or who may be looking into Metroidvanias for your first time,  expect to see a rich and heavy emphasis on exploration.  Copious amounts of character growth, playstyles, and things to collect are just waiting for you.  \n\nCombat is tight and exactly what you would expect from Igarashi's works, the animations and art looking superb for what they're working with.  The music is beautiful and memorable, easily joining the roster of other classic songs from the Castlevanias of the past.  The focus on exploration may mean you'll run into seemingly dead ends, but there's always a demon shard you haven't collected or a spot you haven't yet looked into that'll uncover where you need to go and how you'll get through it.  \n\nGame length can easily go up to 20+ hours for completionists, and that's not even with starting New Game+ or the other content available and coming later to the game.  \n\nThere are certainly some glitches and somewhat annoying bugs that can occur, but it's not too difficult to get past those and really appreciate just how wonderful this game is.  \n\nThis is an amazing love letter to Castlevania fans as it's a Castlevania title in everything but its name, even giving you quests to avenge the deaths of folks with very familiar names... Yet at the same time it's so much more.  It's Igarashi's greatest work to date, and it's a much needed middle finger to Konami for killing a beloved series in favor of pach-inko games and soulless spinoffs.   \n\nEasily one of the best Kickstarter games to date, and I can't wait to see what's coming with future content updates.  This game deserves every bit of praise and it is more than worth the $40 asking price.",Recommended

"I've only just started, but so far it's excellent. It feels like a modern Castlevania: Symphony of the Night.",Recommended
"The art and graphical changes didn't help, it still looks really bad in-game. Gameplay very comparable to Aria/Dawn of Sorrow but the low quality 3D graphics and animations make it feel worse to play. Ultimately a letdown, there's much better stuff out there and for much cheaper.\n\nI would strongly suggest that if you're considering buying this and haven't played the games that Bloodstained took inspiration from like SotN and the Sorrow games that you should play those instead. Momodora is also a fantastic metroidvania that I don't see much love for and it's very cheap.\n\nEdit to address comments because it's too long: Sorry I think people are misunderstanding me. I don't dislike the game solely because it looks bad,though that is a factor. Let me re-explain. It looks like a Vita game. Depending on artstyle some games can look timeless. Compare CSS to TF2. TF2 still looks fairly good because it's heavily stylised, whereas a game meant to look realistic looks like ass nowadays. All the out of game art for Bloodstained looks great. It's 3D implementation looks awful. The 2D pixel-y art of the old vania stuff still looks good if you ask me. Not amazing but I'd much rather look at that. Disclaimer I was playing on max settings. \n\nThat said, the art doesn't make the gameplay worse necessarily and I don't think it does here. What I meant was the animations make it feel worse because they're also not great. The gameplay is a copy paste of Aria/Dawn so it's definitely not bad imo. Compare Alucard's running animation in SotN to Miriam and you'll see what I mean. Miriam running looks so basic and boring, no character put into it whatsoever. Alucard's kinda trail thing says to you from the first screen that he has some kind of dark power. His turning animations looks almost flamboyant which goes hand in hand with his over the top victorian outfit and long flowing hair. There is attention to detail that is completely absent from Bloodstained. I will grant you that AoS had a pretty bad run cycle as well but at least on that you can blame the hardware as you're fighting over pixels on a GBA screen. They didn't even bother giving proper animations to that dude you talk to as you start the first area. Miriam has a talk animation but all they did for the Johannes guy was warp his mouth to make it somewhat look like speaking. It's hard to explain but go back and look at his mouth when he speaks.\n\nI'll grant you this game isn't bad. I think it's the definition of mediocre standing on it's own merits. But it does have the old gameplay formula which is probably gonna be enough for some people. I'll buy it again when it goes on sale but I don't to reward mediocrity. This is not the best they could have made and the old games prove it. I don't want them to copy the old games but I want the attention to detail that turned an alright game only carried but a decent gameplay loop into something great all round (minus the SotN voice acting, though I do love how hammy it is).",Not Recommended

"EDIT 2: I've finished the game on PS4. There is a tonne to do in this game for a full 100%. I'll soon be starting my PC playthrough. Recommendation is still up.\n\nBrilliant game.\n\nMy time is low as on steam, as most of my play time is on PS4. I've been playing the PS4 version since the morning of Monday 17th. I'm finishing that version before I complete the game again on PC. I am an original backer and this game is everything I expected it to be. \n\nIf you're a long term Castlevania fan, expect it to play like Dawn of Sorrow and a bit of OoE. It has all the expected tropes and cool Easter eggs hidden around the castle. The new weapons it has added also helps with varying the gameplay, along with many quests, masteries, and items to craft and complete. Once again, the fake ending appears like in all the other metroidvania games, so don't think you're finished if you defeat ""the final boss"". \n\nThere is enough here to pay homage to the original Metroidvania games from years ago, while also adding enough for it to be worthy successor. I still enjoy using my familiars to find little hidden Easter eggs, or using them to find secret breakable walls to find items to upgrade my character. Little note, bring the Faerie familiar to the Piano in the Garden of Silence. \n\nAlso, the game also adds in two difficulty modes, that increase enemy damage while also mixing up enemy placement. Adding a tonne of replay-ability to the game. Nightmare makes the game extremely difficult, and is fun if you want the challenge.\n\nFinally, “13 Free DLCs” are on the way, and plenty of updates including a co-op mode. I will be coming back to this game for sure in the future, like I have with all the other Metroidvania games.\n\nIf you love Metroidvania then you should 100% be picking this up. \n\nEDIT : I did originally want this game to be pure 2D with sprites, however I've grown to like the 3D models use in game. They've also massively improved upon the graphics since when I played the original beta that was given to backers last year.",Recommended

10/10 truly a masterpiece\nmust buy,Recommended
Truly a love letter to the Metroidvania fans and I'm not a fan of the genre,Recommended
"First boss beaten and I am so far enthralled in both the story and gameplay, tight controls, great voice acting, I'll definitely update my review if it goes down hill at all from here but so far so good!",Recommended
5/5 BRETTY GOOD,Recommended
got my butt kicked by naked octopus lady my hands got cramp out of it long wait over well done!! its a yes for me!!,Recommended
"The game is clean, beautiful and smooth, running all settings at cinematic with no problems. I would have preferred the classic art style from Symphony of the Night but I know high quality 2D handcrafted sprites are expensive and with all things considered this game turned out quite well. Highly recommended for anyone who was a fan of Igarashi's previous work and recommended for anyone who just enjoys a good Metroidvania, hoping to see a lot more from this Developer.",Recommended
"There is just a charm that grabs me with this game. I love Metroidvania's and some of my fav's include Dead cells and Hollow knight. I love those games to death and I think I will like this one too! Mechanically, it's smooth and the placement of save points and fast travel station are really well done! But one of my fav parts is that you can use pretty much any weapon you want. It isn't as hard as the other two, but with added difficulties, hopefully the bosses will get new moves that make them a little more interesting. But there are a lot of intuitive ideas in play here that make it a lot of fun! There are also a mix of new and old ideas that make the game feel familiar and new, such as the enemies and level designs. \n\nP.S. Shovel Knight is always a win",Recommended
"I would absolutely recommend this game, however the launch was executed... poorly.\nI have been playing for less than an hour, and I've already had headless characters, dialogue holes, one freeze, and one fatal error that caused the game to crash. All of that before the first save room. I will continue to play this game once these issues get patched, because it is genuinely a fun game... however for now I will have to put it down till that time.\nGameplay 9\nVisuals 9\nFun Factor 10\nLaunch Execution 1",Recommended
"Just about 15 or so minutes in and its already a 10/10 game. The controls feel spot on, the EX inputs for certain items that require it feel right and that's just the prelude stage....just The Prelude Stage, I haven't even made it to the main castle yet. Not to mention that there's additional content in the future that's gonna be included later down the line (check website for more details).  Big shoutouts to Iga and his multiple lot of teams/team players for developing such an awesome product and bunking that Kickstarter games CAN be done with love and more importantly done correctly.",Recommended
I feel right at home.,Recommended
like the good old days,Recommended
"After finish this game ,I can say this game must buy!",Recommended
"I am overjoyed to say that IgaVania has returned and it is better than ever.\n4 years of Passion, thought and criticism has paid off to make this stellar adventure.\nIga was able to prove the publishers that said no one wanted to play metroidvania games anymore and the people who said the graphics are poop wrong!\n",Recommended
Now this is a good and modern Castlevania game.\n\nGive me more. Much more. I pay whatever you ask. Just want more.,Recommended
"I don't expect those stupid tasks and planting stuff. \n\n=====================================================\n\nNo no no no, I don't have the courage to face the hungry granny...she eats so much",Recommended
Miriam teach me to never skip leg day OwO,Recommended
"if you manage to get past the choppy keyboard controls for special moves, then Bloodstained Ritual of the Night might be one of the best ""metroidvanias"" you can get on modern gen.",Recommended
"Koji Igarashi never make me disappointed since Order of Ecclesia. As a big fan of Castlevania series, I give this game 10/10.",Recommended
"I will write a further review once i have played the game more, but i was both heartbroken and angry to see that the ""coop"" was removed from the steam page on the day of launch.  I have sense read that it was announced to be pushed back to an update later on, but for them to not make that more transparent  when they had to know that some people where buying it with that in mind is a major issue for myself, and i'm sure, others.  I'm sure the game will be great, but that's just no ok.",Recommended
Doesn't make me cry like an anime fan on prom night.,Recommended
AHHHHHHHHHHHHH I LOVE IT SO MUCH,Recommended
"Let us go out the evening for pleasure; the night is still young, and I still have to beat Igarashi for that swordwhip!",Recommended
"I've just started playing and I have to say, it's all I ever wanted from a new Iga game. Symphony of the Night is still one of my all time favorite games. I'm in love, thank you so much <3\n\nUpdate:\nAfter 17 hours of playtime this still holds Recommended.\nIf you enjoyed the original Castlevania games, you will love this game.",Recommended
the game is amazing i knew it was going to be when i saw the kickstarter back before it ended.\n\nhttps://gyazo.com/3a430453995d9a3eb5c5f5d45d29bd82,Recommended
"10/10 would wait 4+ years again! Recommended masterpiece on the best genre ""Igavania""",Recommended
