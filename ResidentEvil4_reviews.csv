"[h1]Technical Aspects[/h1]\nI didn't have any crash issues with this game like some other users were having, though it did crash once throughout all the hours I've played so far... Either way, I believe there's fixes for the crashing somewhere.\n\nGamepad support seems just fine (as long as your PC believes you're using a Xbox gamepad, I'm using a PS4 controller and using Steam's Playstation Configuration Support). [b]DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME WITH MOUSE AND KEYBOARD.[/b] I personally haven't myself but this game was NOT made for it although it does support it, and it supports it better in this PC port as opposed to the original port.\n\nThe motion blur option in video settings is UGLY. The type effect used in this game seems remnant of how it was done in GTA III which is more so a ghosting effect rather than proper motion blur, so turn it off. This is coming from someone who likes motion blur.\n\nThe game seems like it's optimized just fine, it is an old game however, but this just means this PC port wasn't trash. This game should run on a toaster really, as long as it's an up-to-date toaster that is.\n \nIf you've played RE4 before, this is probably the best version for the default experience, which I would assume most people are playing this for. A lot of the trainers for the game are for version 1.0.6 of this game but the Steam version is 1.1.0, so a lot trainers will not work unfortunately and a lot of the mod devs seem to not care to update their trainers for the 1.1.0 version. I'm unsure if other mods work as I haven't tried any of those.\n[h1]My Opinion Of The Game[/h1]\nPersonally, this is my favorite resident evil game by far. The pacing is astounding as I enjoy every minute of this game from start to finish. The story itself is rather decent but the gameplay, in my opinion, is the game's strongest suit as that's what'll bring you back for multiple playthroughs. The game is a perfect blend of action and horror, but it does lean more so on the action side but I wouldn't say it takes anything away from the gameplay; if anything, it adds to it and the replay value. If you've played a classic Resident Evil game this the controls should come naturally, though it controls much different to today's third person shooter games so be aware. I personally wouldn't call the controls bad, just different but it lends to the style of the game and the combat.\n[h1]TL;DR[/h1]\nThis is a must play classic from the PS2 era that everyone must play at some point in their gaming lives. The controls may be a little funky at first but you'll get hang of it and enjoy the game plentifully. USE A CONTROLLER!",Recommended
"I'm very disappointed as the way camera works in this game, it's too annoying and hard to control. Your character won't move follow the angle when you drag your mouse but follow the running direction.\nThis game engine is totally... PATHETIC",Not Recommended
"When it comes to the Resident Evil series I will always love the original Resident Evil the most because of it's iconic setting and the exploration in the spencer mansion. But, if I had to choose a Resident Evil game that comes close to that same level as the original Resident Evil then I have to put Resi 4 at that spot because Resi 4 was exactly what I wanted it to be. A Resident Evil game but with a completely new take on it but still keeping the stuff that made Resident Evil great to begin with and I loved every second of RE4 and I still think it's a great game to this day. When it comes to games, I rarely find time to play them nowadays but Resi 4 was just one of those games that I spent hours upon hour replaying and enjoying all the way through every single time just like the original Resident Evil title. \nThe voice acting is also wonderful with Leon's many silly comments during otherwise life threatening situations. Resident Evil has always had identity and this game is no different I can assure you. \nːskullsːːskullsːːskullsːːskullsːːskullsːːskullsːːskullsːːskullsːːskullsːːskullsːːskullsːːskullsːːskullsːːskullsːːskullsːːskullsːːskullsːːskullsːːskullsːːskullsːːskullsːːskullsːːskullsːːskullsːːskullsːːskullsːːskullsːːskullsːːskullsːːskullsːːskullsːːskullsː\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSy1uEwtU_I\nːskullsːːskullsːːskullsːːskullsːːskullsːːskullsːːskullsːːskullsːːskullsːːskullsːːskullsːːskullsːːskullsːːskullsːːskullsːːskullsːːskullsːːskullsːːskullsːːskullsːːskullsːːskullsːːskullsːːskullsːːskullsːːskullsːːskullsːːskullsːːskullsːːskullsːːskullsːːskullsː\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIXljNli5Uw&feature=youtu.be\nːskullsːːskullsːːskullsːːskullsːːskullsːːskullsːːskullsːːskullsːːskullsːːskullsːːskullsːːskullsːːskullsːːskullsːːskullsːːskullsːːskullsːːskullsːːskullsːːskullsːːskullsːːskullsːːskullsːːskullsːːskullsːːskullsːːskullsːːskullsːːskullsːːskullsːːskullsːːskullsː\nIt's also the perfect game for halloween.

"A very different approach to RE formula in this one (in relation to previous RE games). \n\nIt is more action-horror now then survival horror but it works perfectly! \n\nThe game is exciting and thrilling. There are still moments when you can get scared. \n\nSome enemies are really terryfing, (especialy the giant monster in the lake) and the ""new zombies"" (they act more like agressive humans and can use weapons) are really refreshing and provide a good challenge. \n\nThe story is of course cheesy but it was always like that with RE games.\n\nLocations are beautiful. Weird isolated village, dark forest, a graveyard shrouded in mist near a seculiar chapel, cliffsides near a giant lake, old castle, island with a military instalation and old ruins.\n\nOverall it is a worthy, unforgetable experience.",Recommended

"Coming from consoles, it was pretty disheartening to see how poor of a job they did porting this masterpiece of survival horror. There are problems up and down here: There are glaring visual issues (the face mapping and voice over sync! my god!!) The controls feel loose and unresponsive, there are framerate issues abound... it feels just a little bit like somebody Gmodded Re4, in all honesty. Stick to consoles if you want to experience this classic!",Not Recommended
"Awful controls on K&M, you move like a cumbersome vehicle, however many minutes I've just played this for was a waste of time.  If you were enabled with normal movement the enemies would be dead in seconds but instead it's a battle to get the idiot to point in the right direction, aiming is a joke too. Textures are ugly, the osd is massive on high resolution, the sound is boring. Zero fun.",Not Recommended
"For me, this is the best resident evil game in the series. Highly recommended",Recommended
"It's a good game but i feel it plays worse on PC than what i remember on console. \n\nI couldn't really play it for longer than 20 minutes a time before i got queezy from the camera movement and FOV. I did try looking for mods, or file settings i could tweak to make it a little smoother but unfortunately i couldn't find anything.\n\n",Not Recommended
"Great game.\n\nPlayed it for the 4th time and it is pretty well paced (gameplay wise). The story is a little dumb but you know.\n\nAlthough this game was the beginning of the action shooter genre change for resident evil, this particular title still has a dark and foreboding atmosphere. The first and most of the second part of the game have some really creepy environments that keep you tense. The scariest part is when you see a message where the head honcho of the village, who has up till that point beaten the character in cutscenes, is going to ambush you at a cabin. There are also other scary enemies like the Novistadors and the Regenerators. The regular enemies of the game have also been very well made for the larger environment new in this title.\n\nThis game's story is a bit ridiculous though. Leon has to go find the president's daughter who is rumored to be in a part of Spain. Within 5 minutes of investigating, your backup team is killed and you are trapped in the village. Leon's dialogue consists of a bunch of one-liners and smart mouth responses. The villains you meet are a bit one dimensional and only serve to show how controlling Saddler is and how powerful and different the Los Plagas compared to the other viruses in previous entries of the series. But at the very least both Leon and the villains are entertaining.\n\nThis is a linear shooter game with a merchant available for you to buy and upgrade weapons. You can also find treasure if you stray off the intended path or have a good eye and sell them for money. There are different categories of weapons: pistols, shotguns, sniper riles, and magnums. Each weapon has pros and cons when compared to other ones in its category, but you only really see this after you fully upgrade them. In your normal playthrough you will more than likely get a new version of your weapon when it comes out instead of sticking with your current one because the new version is almost always more powerful than the maximum amount you can upgrade it at that point (new upgrades unlock with each chapter clear). However that may be a good thing because after you try out all the guns in your first playthrough you will know which one is your favorite on your second one.\n\nThis is a very excellent game and it is unfortunate that none of the titles that came after this, except maybe 7, are as good in my opinion. This game had a very nice balance of horror and action and you were not really concerned about the BOW economy and other bull.",Recommended

"People are reviewing this like it was a PS2 exclusive. That port was butt. I remember playing this on my trusty purple Gamecube. Good times (Super Mario Sunshine, Mario Kart Double Dash and Wind Waker). Best port for the time too until the Wii version came out. \n\nRight now, this is the most definitive port out there IMO if you're looking for 60 fps, HD textures, and the ability to mod. \n\nIf you want smoother controls and a more faithful experience intended by it's developers. Get the Wii version.\n\nIt's a cult classic game with a cheesy but also good plot. interesting and well paced. Tank controls like the original games but it's in third person. So you stop and aim and it can take getting used to, but once you play for a bit. It becomes natural. \n\nThis game is best played with a controller. I feel like people turn away from this game because it works like crud on mouse and keyboard. This game was intended to played with a controller.\n\n You shouldn't miss this if you're a Recommended GAMER especially if you haven't played it yet.\n\n(also haven't had any of the crashes people are experiencing so I have no comment on that.)",Recommended

"[h1] Resident Evil 4, a Classic [/h1] \n\nThis game has been released on basically everything at this point, and for good reason. This is one of those great games that you should play or maybe even play again. The gameplay is tight, the story is hilarious and fun, and the characters are memorable. Highly recommended. This was a great port, it runs well and the PC controls are natural. \n\n10/10 Perfect, the big cheese",Recommended
10/10,Recommended
Damn fun and occasionally tense game that's just exciting to play even decades later. The tank controls might be dated but the game plays the controls to its strengths so that it feels right by design -- much the same way the classics used the static camera angles to their advantage. It's up there with the better RE games.\n\nLooks amazing for a GameCube game and didn't have any issues with the port.,Recommended
"This game is 10/10, absolutely, legitimately no question about it. The way the game can make you conserve ammunition for the hordes of undead that spawn in new areas or upon completion of relatively tasking puzzles is great. I've loved this game from start to finish. \n\nWith that said.\n\nIt is clear to see in RE5 at least they realised if you're going to work for something such as the new costumes or unlocked infinite weapons you can at least use them during another playthrough. In RE4, this is the opposite. Once you complete the campaign you unlock a new 'Round', which consists of the same campaign simply played again. When you start a new game, it doesn't seem to allow you to change difficulty, and as such resets all of your equipment as it needs to be a new save to begin the game on a harder difficulty. This has saddened me greatly.",Recommended
"Resident Evil 4 or Biohazard 4, is one of the best games in the franchise that was released world-wide on many different consoles, and even got a IOS port as well. Resident Evil 4 was released in 11, January, 2005. Which has dated since then.\n\nThe game has many survival-horror elements and other elements from the past games that we're released in 1996-1999.\n\nYou play the game as Leon, Scott-Kennedy. Which happens to be the main character of Resident Evil 2, which was released in 21, January, 1998, also for many different consoles, and even got a 2019 remake for PC, PS4, and Xbox One.\n\nThe main-objective in this game, is to rescue The President's daughter, Ashley Graham, and escape. But that didn't go as planned.\n\nYou face many monsters, and enemies, But as long as you have a weapon and ammo and you know how to use it, you should be fine.\n\nI won't say much else, but if you haven't played this game, you really should. But that depends on you.\n\nYou will have many hours of fun, and if your willing to test your strength, attempt Professional Mode, and see if you come out alive.\n\nHave a nice day, and if you bought this game, Enjoy it :D",Recommended

"Whether or not you are a Resident Evil fan, definitely check this game out! The story is interesting (especially if you read the notes scattered throughout the game). The graphics don't compare to modern titles but don't let that hold you back, its charming aesthetic will grow on you the more you play it. Controls are bit confusing, I definitely recommend using a controller for a much better experience. The sound is excellent and cleverly atmospheric. The game does an excellent job balancing difficulty. There will be times where you will feel like you are barely surviving and other times when you'll be doing pretty well. The boss fights are engaging and the regular enemies are always fun to fight. There are several difficulty settings that allow all kinds of players enjoy the game. Finally, the game provides several game modes that range from an alternate story mode to a tense mercenaries mode. Two special costumes, a variety weapons, and New Game+  gives the game high replay value. I wholeheartedly recommend this game! It's definitely worth the $20, but I recommend you wait for the next time it's on sale so you can buy some of the other wonderful Resident Evil games as well. My only complaint is that CAPCOM poorly remastered this game. It is only a little cleaner looking than the Gamecube and PS2 versions. Despite this, it is still an amazing game. 10/10.",Recommended

"Although the controls might take a lot of time to get used to, this game so far has been the most intense and horrific entry to the series that I've played. Having played nearly all titles, Resident Evil 4 has stood out in the masses. Throughout the entire game I was continuously  incredibly impressed with the story and combat pacing. I 100% recommend this game to fans of the series who haven't tried this one yet. Although this game is NOT for everyone. PS: Upon completion this game instantly took the place of my favourite game of all time",Recommended
"I've been a long time fan of this game, ever since I used to watch my father play it on our PS2 back in 2006. I've played the 2005 PC port which looked awful but had a solid 30FPS and later on a new port was released in 2007 for the PC with added original PS2 effects and now after trying this version I can say with no doubt that this is the best Resident Evil 4 experience I've ever had in my life and keep in mind I've been playing this game since 2008 I think and beaten it so many countless times that I can play the game in my mind and get every detail right. This port is is not without any bugs, there are quite a few like Generic controller bugs, sniper rifle slow motion, and the fact that this game's speed is tied to the framerate oh and the fact that fire effects are rendered at 30 fps but that's because the game is old, other than that this port is on point.",Recommended
"Capcom didn't port the game from console and now it's a mess, they promised a patch in 2015 and still haven't delivered. Do not waste your money. You often times can't even access the menu without it crashing or freezing and then when you get to the game itself you get additional issues piled on top.  \n\nOn the positive side they added high definition graphic (which everybody has to disable to even play anyway!!!) \nThanks Crapcom.",Not Recommended

"Resident Evil 4 is one hell of a mixed bag. It's combat is fantastic and satisfying, it has a fast pace and never kept me bored, I got actually scared by it because of the sheer tension during the scenes and fights, and it has some of the best enemy variety in gaming. \nBut it's easily bogged down a good chunk of the missions having you do one long escort mission and quick time events that come from complete left field and instantly kill you if you fail. These may seem like small issues compared to the pros I just listed off, and yes they are. You can easily circumvent having to worry about your escort objective dying if you just tell them to sit down and wait for you, while you go clear the area. The quick time events is something that you cannot go around however. \nMore importantly, this game, as a port of a classic game, is downright insulting. The game has little options in terms of video settings, alot of weapons still have their reload animations in 30 frames per second, audio consistantly cut's out for a few seconds when a cutscene plays, the game is prone to crashing a whole fucking lot. And on one occasion, I had to completely restart my computer, which mind you can run this game 16 times over.\n\n\nTL;DR emulate this game",Recommended

"This game holds up pretty well once you adjust to the control scheme. It's a great action game, but unfortunately loses some of the more tense horror moments from the earlier games because of how powerful you feel thanks to a better camera and control system. The voice acting is good, but leans towards being a bit campy at times. This is a game that has taken me forever to actually finish because I usually get annoyed with Leon's attitude towards every situation, but he's still a likable character with a great supporting cast, and compelling/believable villains in this situation. If you are a horror fan, and if you are a Resident Evil fan, you should definitely own this, especially at this low cost. One thing to be wary of is strange performance issues, but those are documented on the Steam Forums with recommended fixes.",Recommended

"This is one of my favorite games of all time, not just in the series but overall. However the port quality was an issue (some have it real bad, I didn't).\n\n[h1] Port Quality: [/h1]\nThe game ran okay for most of it, but some random points (not even when a lot was going on) cause the game to drop in FPS, making the character slower than molasses. Heck, reloading the Semi-Auto Rifle drops the frames from 60 to 40. I never had any crashes or anything, but it was enough to be a slight nuisance. Also, for whatever reason, the cut scenes in Separate Ways are of garbage quality (think GameCube), but the cut scenes elsewhere are fine. Odd, but not unbearable, and I've never noticed this on other remasters. KB+M controls are odd for someone who's never played an RE game on PC, but can be figured out (if I have to press page down to rotate a thing, I don't like that).\n\n[h1] Game Quality: [/h1]\nLet's be honest: this is the best RE game ever made. Some may say it's either RE2/RE2Make (like a close 2nd) or even CV (Steve ruins it), but this game has phenomenal story and gameplay, and there are no points where I get exhausted from the game. Enemies are really neat and unique, and some can provide good scares (Regenerators are spooky). Bosses (mini or not) are fun to battle, especially the Wolverine(?) dudes. This game also started the Mercenaries mode where you fight ongoing wave of enemies (RE3 started it, but it was different), and provides good fun.\n\nOverall, amazing game, but not a great port, even if you meet system requirements. If you use console more often, I recommend it there, but without any major issues, I had a great time with this game.\n\n\n",Recommended

"if all you played was the gamecube version get this there is a bit more in it for the die hard fans who want more than to just put this in their collection. This is a positive review for the closest to a perfect game in the series. If you want to start off with one that made the series popular start here as it's way more fun and dare I say scary than 5 or 6. Alright so here's some common issues players with windows 10 computers will have.\n\n1 - if the game runs slow\nexit your game. Go into the options and turn the games HD settings off. You may also need to turn the frame rate to 30fps. Then the game becomes more responsive like how you remember playing it on gamecube or similar. If you need those 60fps because its a higher number that sounds cool you can experiment with lower resolutions. I saw hardly any difference with a higher end monitor and a computer with far beyond the specs of this game. \n\n2 - my controller is too sensitive\nsame as before exit the game. They were too lazy to program controller sensitivity and were just trying to make a quick buck porting this. To fix this issue you'll want to actually go into mouse and keyboard settings. Adjust the mouse sensitivity and for whatever reason it fixes the controller even if you're using a basic third party controller with no additional software to adjust these. \n\n3 - my logitech f310 controller isn't picking up\nflip it over and slide the D to X switch to X. This I learned playing RE5 and devil may cry ""HD"" version. \n\nGoing from RE3 on PS1 to this is a giant leap. They pulled off the aiming system so well in this. It's scarier than 3. There are still puzzles that'll require more thought than in later titles though I haven't played the #2 remake or #7. They nailed the atmosphere it isn't just go into a room like a bug exterimnator. Hardly any one hit kills at least on easy. Yes there is actually difficulties on this game. If you're a pro player who played the gamecube port you'll notice there is no difficulty. This is on purpose. The game adjusted to how you played the game. Some levels had more enemies. Some less because of it. This they flat out give you a difficulty level. This means you'll skip the maze part, the clock tower scene , there will be less catapults, some parts having less enemies in parts and it rewards you to go back and play on the higher difficulties. Playing the bonus ada mission the 5 part one gamecube didnt have is either lazy or genius for fan service. However i hate how the one that is on gamecube the samples are the only thing in the entire game or bonus missions that take up inventory space.\n\none thing that doesn't get praised enough is the button mashing parts do not get progressively harder such as in metal gear solid games where you got to pretty much break a controller to get past the interrogation scenes in MGS 1, 2 or 3\n\nwhen you beat the game keep that cleared file, if you get a weapon unlocked on professional, the cleared file means you can have it on fun i mean normal. You're rewarded by completing just about every mode in the game including getting 5 stars n all 4 of the mercenaries missions with all 5 characters. cough cough cheat engine. The machine gun and all make the game a lot more enjoyable.\n\nWhat I like about this game is there is a currency system it's not all cryptic to get every gun and so forth in it. The currency was used in spain until 2002. I really like the shop keep. You can kill him and he respawns a few levels later like nothing happened. There is an abundance of ammo in this unlike RE6 or code veronica. The bosses are nowhere near as specific as some other titles such as Tyrant on code veronica in the plane or the first real boss of RE5. What they experimented in this game worked. Such as the bit of sailing a boat and so forth. But more than anything you can aim! yes this is the first game you can freely aim. \n\nanyways things I didn't like about this game\nwhere the developers decided to put the camera behind Leon is atrocious. It's at somewhat of a slant so unless you've got no life and played this for 100+ hours speed running you have to get used to it and compensate so much to land a head shot or something you could pull off in 2 seconds in a hitman, metal gear solid or gta game. \n\nin the mercenaries missions using Krauser or hunk is a liability. Hunk cannot stun mr chainsaw or mr big chainsaw at all so it's not enjoyable. Krauser has in some ways the best weapons in the game in other ways the worst. It was so unfair they gave him the death move that charges up. Using Ada and wesker are the only two to make it fun. \n\nprotecting Ashley\nthere was so much more potential for achievements \ntarget practice mini games are annoying, I'd include them in a menu outside the game to warm up \nthe lasers or any potential instant death playing on normal or easy \ni wish the striker shotgun had a faster fire rate, it was just a stronger riot gun\nI can't drop items and pick them up again. A mechanic I've only seen in RE zero\nanything to do with Krauser especially his playable bonus missions \nyou can't walk and shoot, this creates blind spots - they oddly enough fixed this in 6\nthe first set of controls are annoying. Switch to setting 2.\nthere are no shoulder buttons to move across menus faster\nexiting to the main menu is a chore \nthere is no windowed option to check emails or anything while playing this \n\nthe key items are quite dumbed down. Thankfully they don't take up real estate on your inventory. The key items could have been handled better such as in the spencer mansion in RE1 where you may have a key for hours not knowing what it does your first play through. \n\nthe worst boss had to be hands down the one in the falling containers. \n\nThere is some slow down even when you set the game to standard graphics and 30fps even on a more modern computer, you can adjust the resolution and all to get those 60fps or do some tips and tricks online but it doesn't make a big deal until you get to the action scene against Krauser will be a little tricky with the video out of sync in that cut scene you cannot skip where it's all quick time events. \n\nI think the game should have ended running out of Salazar's castle. The 5th and 6th chapters were about as Resident evil as a pink puff sucking up enemies and gaining their powers. Yet people spit on Chris's campaign which felt very similar in RE6. It could have made for another side mission such as when you play as Ada to run in and get the sample. \n\nThis game does have replay value with the new game + and of course all the secrets and unlockables but by the time you unlock wesker and gotten that weapon for completing the game on professional you're pretty much done and bored of this game. However the main story you don't get or need an S ranking to unlock junk unlike future resident evil games which grade you for everything. I'll give it that as a bonus. \n\nAll in all it's aged quite well aside from the biggest issue portion and is a lot more enjoyable than 5 or 6 for their own reasons. There is a reason why so many people talk about this game as it's in just about every resident evil fans top 3 for a reason. Though not perfect and some scenes really REALLY drag on it's one of the better games in the series. \n\nif they ever re-did this game just update the graphics to a much more A/B comparison, fix the camera angle and fix the technical issues like the slowdown frame rates and no windowed mode as well as the controller sensitivity and for the love of god don't make it harder like they did in the RE1 and RE2 remakes. We have difficulties and if i want to die 1000 times i'll just play on professional like a sensible adult. Maybe a few new levels or something but besides that don't touch it. It's as close to perfect as capcom will get in a RE game besides the original 1 for its time. Plus keep it at no DLC, skill should still unlock stuff. If people want to pay let them.",Recommended
Great game from my memories!,Recommended
Classic.,Recommended
Don't buy if you have a monitor with more than 60hz. mouse and keyboard controls are acceptable but playing it with a controller is better.,Recommended
"It's RE4, arguably the best one in the franchise. You have already played this game, if you haven't, you need to.\nGame play is fun, and varied enough in it's mechanics, enemy types and puzzles to keep things from getting stagnant. It's a horror game in the same capacity that Bohemian Rhapsody is an Opera. Doesn't make the experience any less compelling.\nAs for cons, the keyboard controls are awkward, whoever ported this game has probably never seen a computer, much less played video games on one. The dialogue is so bad that there is no way it wasn't written that way on purpose. The story is classic Resident Evil. Things happen, why? Who cares.\nAshley is the worst thing to come out of video games, and is probably the only Recommended horror aspect of this game.\nWell worth the price when it was on sale, hard to justify buying a relatively sad port of a game you have played through already at the asking price.\n\n\n  \n",Recommended
The game did not run for me at all and i had to request a refund. my computer is more than capable of running this game so unless i had to do somthing special with the files i dont know about it is unplayable for some.,Not Recommended
"One of the best games ever made - it still plays great, looks fantastic, and feels as fresh as the day it was unreleased. What distinguishes it above and beyond the other games in the series, and what makes it a superlative model for the entire genre, is its flawless approach to pulse-pounding action: the controls are absolutely perfect and it feels simple, clean, and deeply satisfying to handle all the game’s weapons. Definitely one of Capcom's finest adventure games and a must-own by any standard. \n\nAlso, shout-outs to my favorite character, the mysterious salesman...you'll never forget this guy and his weirdly memorable lines. ""What're ya buyin'?""",Recommended
One of my favorite games. Played it on practically every system. Can never get tired of replaying it.\nIf you get bored try beating the game with just the basic sniper rifle only on pro mode. Huge challenge.,Recommended

"Resident Evil 4 is a great game. It may not be that interesting story-wise and its gameplay may be severely disadvantageous and annoying, but remember, it's an old game from 2005. It's laggy on some big areas, but that's because it's a bad port, like many games.\n\nDespite all of these problems, remember, it's an old game. It was mainly released for playstation 2. Despite all of this, I liked it. It provided me with 20 hours of gameplay.\n\nYou get to play the campaign with the main protagonist Leon, and then later if you like, you may play as Ada, where the time is set is exactly like the campaign.",Recommended

"RE4 is still to this day one of my favorite shooters. It gave the franchise a new direction that balanced the horror elements with more action driven gameplay leading to a much more enjoyable type of game in my opinion. The story is a bit ridiculous but and though it isn't even close to being a masterpiece it does serve it's purpose, offering up a handful of memorable characters and interactions. The controls take a while to get used to but once you do movement and action is fluid and immersive. The sound also helps keep more of the horror atmosphere in the game and though the voice acting is a bit corny it still well done for the most part. Although the graphics were great for the time, and the remaster helps to make it a tad more modern looking but I still feel like this is the most outdated aspect of the game. It shows it's age but thankfully there seems to be mods on the way that take them just a bit further. Although low textures and low resolutions are abundant, the game still does wonders with lighting and the overall world layout so that it still seems impressive.",Recommended

"If you're either playing the Gamecube version or the PS4 HD port, RE4 is a great game. However, this PC HD port is far from the best way you can experience this game, if it somehow isn't the worst.\n\nNo joke, your computer can be TOO GOOD for this port, causing your game to slow down because of the fixed framerate it forces itself to play at. You can optimize this framedropping by manually make the game use your GPU over it's default (and unchangable ingame) setting through the game files. And when you aren't experienced enough like me to try that, it just sucks. Even cutscenes get slowed down, however the audio keeps up the same speed, meaning 9 times out of 10, the cutscene audio will be ahead by 5 seconds or more.\n\nThey even fucked up the freedom that is mouse aiming, and many controls that are impractical cannot be changed. Do you want to know what the default AND unchangable button to rotate your items in inventory is? PAGE DOWN. Did you even know computer keyboards still had this damn button? I didn't, but luckily they still exist.\n\nGet the HD PS4 port, fuck it, even the original Gamecube or Wii port. But NOT the steam port.",Not Recommended

"[h1] It's Freakin' Resident Evil 4 Bro, What Could I Possibly Say About It That Hasn't Already Been Said? [/h1]\n\nWell...I guess I could discuss the quality of the port...\n\n[i] AHEM [/i]\n\nCapcom ""claims"" that's it's an HD Remaster, but it's only MOSTLY an HD Remaster. Things like the bonus campaign ""Separate Ways"" use the original FMV's, which were designed for those old school televisions with their crappy resolutions. Some textures didn't see the same amount of love as others, but they are texture's that didn't really need the graphical uptick anyway, like dirt, or rubble, or some minor, one-off props.\n\nIt ran fine for me. No crashes, glitches (that weren't already present in previous releases), nothing. 60 FPS with mouse aiming glory. Like I said, it's RE4.\n\nI will say this though, playing this game with the keyboard and mouse, though it may be rather awkward at first, is vastly superior than using a gamepad. I'm serious. The mouse makes aiming silky smooth and extremely easy, so much so that you're gonna be able to do things you didn't imagine you could in the original, like snapping to an enemy's head, shoot em, kick em, and then snap to the other enemy's head within in the snap of your fingers. With the gamepad it's all awkward and slow, cause you know they have that whole gradual, cursor acceleration thing so your little laser dot doesn't feel uncontrollable.\n\nLearn to play with the keyboard and mouse. I'm telling you, it's the way to go. Even better than playing it with a Wii remote.\n",Recommended

"Such a good horror survival game, and one of the best RE games as well. It's a very unique turn on the series, with the over the top shoulder camera game play, and is more action oriented as well. The enemy designs are cool as fuck. and the game doesn't lose it's campy horror, and hilarious cheesy dialogue. The game play is still solid and fun to play despite losing the more survival aspect of the franchise, and the feeling of constant dread and fear of running out of ammo. Ashley is still an annoying little cunt, and the controls are still kinda whack with the awkward tank like movement. But like everyone else I got used to it. It plays fine with a solid 60 fps cap, and the game is very replayable. Overall if you don't have a copy of this on PC and you love the RE franchise, buy it. If you like survival horror games, and shooting, and don't mind tank controls, pick this one up as well. Instant classic",Recommended

"Well, I have to say that I had fun. It is the good ol' Resident Evil 4 we all know and love but it is unstable as f*ck, runs like a b*tch even in high spec PCs and it isn't as moddable as old versions were.\n\n1.1 version was better but, as I said, I had fun. Would recommend geting in sales, it is indeed worth getting.",Recommended
"The best game in the Resident Evil series. It shead of all the stupid lore from previous titles, and its revorked controls were an inspiration for most 3rd person games to come.",Recommended
I love this game,Recommended

"Even after all these years, 'Resident Evil 4' is one of those games that screams high quality no matter where it is ported to, and this particular version is no exception. Sure, the tank controls may feel outdated by some, and sure, the overall tone is not typical of a standard 'Resident Evil' game, but there's a reason why many people consider RE4 one of, if not the greatest game of its genre.\n\nWith hours upon hours worth of content to explore and the addition of high resolution textures, this particular version of RE4 is a game that RE fans should not miss out on - antiquity notwithstanding.",Recommended
pretty good,Recommended
The President's daughter Ashley has been kidnapped by Spanish zombie cultists! Are you a bad enough Raccoon City survivor to save Ashley?,Recommended
"Resident evil 4 is legit the only game that I own every remake of. I'm fond of the Gamecube version because I grew up with it, but it lacks a few things the re-releases have. The Wii version has better aim imo, PC version has better (slightly) graphics. PC controls are meh for me on this game, but hey on a good day with a good sale I'd suggest picking it up because it's an amazing game on any platform.",Recommended
If you love horror and adventure this classic is for you,Recommended
"What can i say. It's a classic. Maybe not Classic Resident Evil like many may know or love, but it has definitely grown to be a classic in It's own way. It was the turning point for the series, and even though Resident Evil has been through quite a few rough spots, I think it has finally come to form. Resident Evil has always been a series that has taken risks. Going from fixed camera angles, to over the shoulder action oriented game play. Yet the little nuances that were staples in Resident evil have remained, and helped retain it's identity. \n\nResident Evil 4 is a non stop, action packed ride, with Saturday morning cartoon characters, and cheezy dialogue. It's got a fairly decent amount of content that adds a pretty good amount of replay value. The game is incredibly linear, but definitely worth multiple play through's. \n\nSo go for it. Give it a try, Even if you never touch it again, It's still a great game that everyone should at least play once.",Recommended
"Played this game just recently and the controls take a bit of time to get used to at first with a mouse and keyboard, but it's a real fun game to play.",Recommended
"This game is amazing.. I luke it just because killing zombie. Also i can change keyboard much faster, i appreciate it :3",Recommended

The best game.,Recommended
"This is a game that has defined many childhoods, mine included(through nightmares cause I was young). But now I must say having completed the game multiple it is a really good game. One thing I do have to point out is that the controls are weird but that is justified given the fact that it came out in 2005 -2004.The HD edition offers a lot of improvements regarding the graphics of the game and some changes in stats from tje ps2 edition.Resident Evil 4 is one of (if not my most) favourite game that I would totally recomend.",Recommended
"My favorite game of all time. I have beat this game around 10 times on 5 different systems. I recommend this to anyone who hasn't played it, It is a staple in the survival horror genre.",Recommended
How does a game get to be so perfect... RE4 is aging beautifully and this HD port is doing the game some mayor justice! I highly recommend picking this game up if you're a RE fan but never got around to part of the series. Old enough to be a classic. New enough to not be too clunky. =),Recommended
Still Terrifying,Recommended
"Best Game Ever, $20 buy it, on sale buy it, just buy it\n",Recommended
Yes,Recommended
Just as good as it was on the Gamecube,Recommended
"Really captures the experience of visiting the rural Spanish countryside. 10/10, would fight spooky midgets in giant castles again.",Recommended
"NOTE: I love this game but do not recommend this 'port' as it takes some work getting it to work, at least properly and without crashes or freezes depending on your OS build or hardware. There are fixes on the Community Forums and if your willing to put that work in making it function then i most recommend you play this game if you have not. it does have full controller support but the keyboard layout is refreshing to utilize if you do not have  a game pad of some kind.\n\nWhy i love this game:\nI have played the resident evil series since near its inception, at 4 years old. Scared the hell out of me then never beat the first game until i was 7 but by that point i was hooked. Zombies, puzzles, boss fights. Sign me up. Resident Evil 4 puts a fantastic spin on old formula by adding new ones and even though the 3rd person over the shoulder perspective was jarring at first to control it was addictive fun preferable to the archaic tank control combat of yore. This is a very good game with a learning curve that will be hard at first for newcomers to the series but once familiar i bet anyone can start trouncing ganados like flies with a swatter. However, this game has one glaring downside. \nIT is basically one long escort mission, find the presidents daughter and save her but as the A.I can be very useless and some enemies can straight up kill her it can be very frustrating at certain points but looking past that the games Mechanics, Atmosphere, Sound Design, Playability and over all Immersion are impressive for a game released in the first Quarter of 2004. \n\non a basis of game play i recommend this game but perhaps on another platform given the bugs in this release.",Not Recommended

Re4 is one of those weird games that you'll play for an hour and decide you've had enough for now and don't really get the hype. But then you want to go back. Rinse and repeat until you're hooked on it. \n\nAnd you'll never want to stop.,Recommended

"Do not get this version of the game. It's bad. Capcom didn't transition it well to PC. Some QTE don't work (either using a controller and it switching to a keyboard input you have to use randomly, or the button you have to press just not working at all, resulting in a death). Also the game can run at 60 FPS but the reloading runs at 30 no matter what, textures also flicker a lot, and they just look bad unless you mod them since they are so low res with the higher res character models, and there aren't any ways in game to tweak the settings of your controller. If you want to play this game, get it on console or even buy a GameCube or Wii and play those versions instead. I'm honestly amazed they released the game in this state. \n",Not Recommended

"This is my second favorite game of all time. I love the atmosphere, the gameplay, and the unlockable items after beating the game. These things make the game really really fun and the unlockables make the game even more fun to play and add replayability. This game is also really hard at some moments but thats what makes it fun.

"Pretty nice nostalgic game from my childhood :) HD Texture update Looks nice. Although for windows 10, this game can crash if you're using fullscreen with uncommon resolution (Fix is to play it in windowed 16:9 resolution - 1920x1080 etc.)\n\nClunky controls make this game more challenging than you think (harder to hit enemies/ turn around/ know what is happening around you).\n",Recommended

Fucking awesome.\n\n10/10 would blow up El Gigante again.",Recommended
"Playing this after RE2make, RE1 & RE0 and the game is giving me a run for my money.

Love the old style of RE games but hate the newer ones? (Apart from 7) This is a good mix that doesn't make the game any less enjoyable. The graphics are a bit dated at this point but until capcom releases an HD remake this is what you will have to settle for. (Hopefully we don't have to wait tooo long.),Recommended

"A classic.\n\nSpeedrunabble in an hour and a half.\n\nCollectively over all the consoles I have played on, I have probably almost 9000 hours on this game since it was THE game of my childhood. As far as the game itself, I won't break it down normally since while there is a story, it really comes to life as an survival shooter.\n\nThe gameplay is excellent with its nice shooting mechanics, ability to capitalise on where you shoot an enemy plus the choices you have when upgrading weapons or even buying new ones. \n\nAs a result, gameplay does not get old in the entire section of the game through repeated walkthroughs and it can even reward players if they know where certain treasures are. The shooting is rather clean apart from certain guns instability and Leon shaking more than if he was stuck in the Arctic.\n\nIt's hard to put into words why this game is so good but the short of it is that: gameplay is awesome.",Recommended

Getting GeDoSoDa running can be a pain (though tutorials can be found google search) .

One of my favorite games of all time.\n\nI first played this on the original GameCube release and have repurchased on multiple platforms as they were released.\nDespite a lack of branching paths or randomization that would usually lead to replayability I have completed multiple playthroughs on all versions I owned. And if your anything like me you will continue to play through it again every year or so.\n,Recommended
Just an amazing game (one of the best I've ever played). Nostalgia is strong on this one.,Recommended
"With the next generation of consoles like gamecube and playstation 2, Resident evil moved more and more away from the survival horror genre, and towards the survival action, mostly because the new perspective and gameplay changes that started to occur in Resident evil 4, continued in Resident evil 5 and ended in Resident evil 6. These 3 games have the most basic things in common, but they have a lot of differences as well. I will review and compare them.\n\nThe Plots\n\nGood characters. \n\nRE4: We have Leon as the main ""Hero"". It has evolved since the Raccoon city events in RE2, I mean the old version, before it was an amateur anti-hero, now is a veteran anti-hero, the tragic one man army of this adventure. Which has a lot of cliches, as Saddler would say. The police men that accompany him at the start are just for bait. He will meet with Luis, which will be a really dumb sidekick replaced with Ada later, Ashley the damsel in distress that acts like a game over trigger and screams like a goat, Ingrid Hannigan is just for the game exposition untill she is replaced by the bad guys, Mike is another character that will only have a highlight in the entire game and then vanish. So, bottom line, in RE4 will be the bad guys that will steal the show and make it worth watching, despite Umbrella's moment is over. 3/10\n\nStory.\n\nRE4: The president's daughter has been kidnapped, and Leon has to rescue her. While the zombies, and Umbrella are gone forever, a new virus called las plagas can be injected into anyone and a few hours later his or her mind will be controlled by the leader of a ""religious"" group, called the Los Iluminados, which has the plan of controlling the world. Apart from them, other people will be interested in obtaining the virus for unknown reasons. 3/10\n\nBad Characters.\n\nRE4: Bitores Mendez, also called the big cheese, Ramon Salazar, Krauser, Osmund Saddler. All them appear in order, one after another dies, to face Leon. They are very original and threatening, but also a bit funny when they jack the line, and they have also minor and major creatures under their control as well. All them will have to mutate themselves to give Leon a bad time, just like William did in RE2. Then we have Ada and Wesker in the shadows, what else can you ask? 10/10\n\nSide stories:\n\nRE4: Ada will have to retrieve the samples of the virus from Saddler, Leon and Krauser, while helping Leon at the same time, and send them to Wesker. These two minigames are shorter but harder. 6/10\n\nThe Action:\n\nGameplay\n\nRE4: The one that started the change from survival horror to survival shooting. 1 player only, your partner can only wait and follow you. The game is over if: Leon or Ashley has 0 HP, suffers one deadly attack, fails certain QTEs, or Ashley is taken away by a ganado during regular gameplay, but you have infinite continues and door saving to make things easier. You can still use typewriters to save but without ribbons or memory cards now, and the game is now episodic to make it longer. Oh, and here you can start trusting on your knife to attack or break stuff. It can stun enemies, making you able to kick or suplex them, and thus conserve ammo for harder enemies later. If you get stuck or get good at the game, it will change its difficulty dinamically.  7/10\n\nSurviving:\n\nRE4: Apart from automatic death attacks or scenes, you can get the traditional red and green herbs, and mix them to recover more health. Blue herbs are removed from the game but a new yellow herb appears here which when combined with a green herb or a green+red one will make increase your maximum health points while recovering the health as usual, but with a limit. You can apply that to Ashley as well. There are first aid sprays that act as a full healing, and the merchant can sell those if you have almost no health herbs or sprays. And you can get food such as eggs and fishes, but the last ones occupy a lot in your inventory. 8/10\n\nWeapons, items and currency:\n\nRE4. Basicly perfect. You can unlock and buy new weapons as you progress the game and also buy updates to them and accesories from the merchant. You cannot buy ammo, herbs and grenades though, but the enemies drop a lot of that or currency or herbs as you need them. Also you get maps with treasures which you can get and sell and upgrade your case. Some of the treasure items can also be combined for a more expensive treasure to sell to the merchant 9/10\n\nReplay factor:\n\nRe4: 3 difficulty modes. Some extra weapons post game. 2 different extra costume sets for Leon and Ashley. And a few extra stuff that can be achieved within one playthrough or the short but tricky side stories by Ada, and the mercenaries with different characters and stages to get 5 stars in all them by all them for another reward. That's just something, but not good enough against RE5 and RE6, so the score is 3/10. Luckily there are a lot of versions of this game out there, without counting fan modifications to compensate that.\n\nThe technical part is the hardest to rate for me, but what is a game without it's graphics and sound? All are good but, which RE game is betther in both?\n\nGraphics:\n\nRE4: 6/10.  It needed to be put in HD to look better.\n\nSound and music:\n\nRE4: 5/10. I like the voice acting of the ganados and characters\n\nFinal scores:\n\nRE4: 60/100\n\nTell me what you think in the comments!",Recommended
"How is it that RE4 manages to be so annoying yet at the same time be so much fun? There's a lot of annoying parts which are just hard to get through, which requires you to play these parts over and over again until you know it by heart and you finally beat it (oh yeah). Maybe that's what makes the annoying parts so fun, the challenges. And there's a certain charm to how over the top annoying and completely useless the president's daughter is. Her dumbass screams: ""LEON! LEON!"" as she get's caught YET AGAIN, I guess, is still part of the charm.\nSooooo... despite being annoying as shit it manages to be one of the better half of RE-games, at least better than RE5 and RE6.\nAnd if you can't stand that orange shirt wearing damsel in distress Ashley what's-her-face, there's still that awesome merchant guy (""whaddya sellin'??? whaddya buyin'???) who makes up for it by selling you some nice firepower in your aid to blast your way through mindless zombies, rabid dogs, and cosplaying midgets.\nRecommendation: just buy it.",Recommended

"This version is the first I ever played, but it won't be the last. I didn't grow up with it, so there’s no nostalgia goggles. In the 75ish hours I clocked in, I managed to beat the game on Normal, unlock and play through all of the extras at least once, play through two more times on Pro (once for the challenge, and once with all the wacky weapons) and 100% the achievements. It's simply one of the best games I've ever played, maybe THE best. Elements of the core gameplay loop are highly unusual and will take some getting used to, but once you do, it is simultaneously a tense and suspenseful horror experience, and a satisfying and cathartic shooter. The adaptive difficulty keeps you in the zone all the way through. You always feel empowered, but you’re never more than a few wrong steps away from death. The story, characters, and overall writing is ridiculous, but in a sort of Sam Raimi tongue-in-cheek way that leaves you feeling like you’re laughing with the game and not at it. For $20 before sales, I’d call this a very easy recommendation.",Recommended

"Highly recommend this game. Even if you played it on another console (Wii for me), the game just addicts you to it with its awesome gameplay, and every playthrough gets better and better. I play on a very budget system and it works wonders, even if it sometimes crashes around the castle areas. But once you know how to get around those crashes or just get lucky, there are no more. One thing to note: for me, around the Separate Ways segment of the game, I still can't get through the second episode because it crashes randomly.

"The game that kicked off a divisive era to Resident Evil, in terms of moving away from survival horror to survival action horror to straight up just action games. Even though it started the trend this one is oddly still widely loved which does deserve it with all the re-releases, everyone else seems to agree as well. There are a lot of poorly designed areas in this game that make it a hassle to get through, but to me it doesn't take from the experience at all. Here's an unpopular opinion, the Resident Evil games were never serious its always been B-horror from the beginning. So I don't know why people bitch when it isn't serious because the series has never been that. All in all one a fantastic game and I dare say a fantastic Resident Evil game!",Recommended

"Long story short it's a bad port of a great game (I played the PS2, first PC port and Wii version).\n\nAfter installing it you may find the game unplayable even when in theory your specs far exceed the game requirements. After a frustrating internet search for a solution I found out that I had to go to Nviidia control panel and set the game to use my preferred GPU. With that the game seems to run as intended but that's not the end of the problems.\n\nYou will still randomly experience stutters during gameplay, off sync audio in custscenes, button prompts during QTE will switch to K+M when using a gamepad ohhh... and crashes. That stuff really kills the enjoyment of a game that was known for it's smooth and tight gameplay.\n\nVisually it's your typicall ""HD"" port a mix of sharp and blurred mess. The whole 60FPS thing was done very lazy, has issues with certain game aspects and is hampered by random stutter. \n\nIf like me wanted you wanted a PC version for an easy plug and play experience of RE4 without having to dig up your old consoles, that's not happening. Only buy it when it's 75% off if you want it that badly and are willing to risk if there will be issues on your system(crashes may occur late in the game way past refund time) or just get REmake or RE0 which are much better ports.\n\n[Update} Regarding crashes on Win10 OS, you have to disable ""TabletInputService"" in CMD, pretty obvious stuff everyone knows this, totaly not obscure info that you stumble upon by chance.",Not Recommended

"Short Review - No Spoilers\n\nTo cut a long story short: This portation of Resident Evil 4 disappointed me so much that I stopped playing after just a few minutes. While I did not experience the general compatibility problems that many other users had with just starting the game, the controls just made this game unplayable for me.\n\nThe fact that you cannot strafe with your character and that the mouse view is both sluggish and awkward at best makes you stumble around in this Zombie shooter like a complete fool. The only alternative that you have as opposed to the catastrophically bad keyboard + mouse layout is to switch to a gamepad to play the game (pretty much the same way as it was released for the consoles a few years back). \n\nIf this works for you, then you may find that RE4 can be a good or even great game after all, but for me this certainly did not work. \n\nThe control mechanics of its successor RE5 are flawless and of a specific console port to the PC I pretty much expect the devs to invest some work to make it playable on PC hardware. The de-facto standard for PC shooters / third person perspective games is a WASD control layout with strafing on A and D and this standard has been existing for decades now. Even if the Leon character in the original console version may not have been able to strafe, that is a very pathetic excuse for not adding this feature for the PC version and I cannot accept the argument that RE4 was “designed to keep the player on the run” and to ""make the player fear the hordes of zombies"". There are numerous better ways of creating anxiety and keeping the player under stress.\n\nTaking that and adding the problems with even starting the game that many other users had, I can only arrive at one conclusion: I cannot recommend this game (as PC port). \n\nI find this really sad, because I heard so many positive recommendations about this game and I cannot give the actual game the credit it (most probably) deserves.\n\nI can definitely recommend RE5, though, which I find to be one of the best coop-shooters (with some added horror flair) I ever played.\n",Not Recommended
The best resident evil game.,Recommended
"This game feels right. It has perfect mix of action and survival horror. Not too scary but it can keep its spooky atmosphere throughout the game mainly thanks to music and design of enemies. Despite being made in 2004/2005 it still has fairly decent graphics and HD edition makes this experience only better. The game was clearly made with controller being the main way how to play although aiming with mouse makes it much easier to hit enemies, on the other hand using A and D keys to turn left and right took some time to get used to it.\n\nStorywise the game is moreless simple but there are some surprises and unexpected parts. Enemy design as mentioned before is pretty spooky and as you proceed through story it changes significantly as well as new weapons and types of enemies show up. Of course not only enemies change but so do you as you also get to unlock new weapons that can change your gameplay.\n\nMain characters are great and so are the bosses, no one feels like they shouldn't be there. Leon is straight up badass who can for whatever reason kick enemies heads off, Ashley spends 3/4 of game being either kidnapped or following Leon but despite that she gets her time to shine as well, if only she didn't sound so annoying when asking Leon for help. Ada acts as supportive character in main story but her own story - Separate ways explains why and what she did in main story to help Leon and Ashley.\nAs for bosses' design most of them have their own gimmick aka their weakness, be it grenades, knife or just fuckton of bullets. The Mercenaries is fun little mode that most if not all Resident Evil games have where you get to shoot enemies and try to get highest score. Ada's little fun mode Assignment Ada doesn't add much to the overall story and it acts more like bonus content which would probably be locked behind DLC if this game came out earlier.\n\nGameplay is pretty fun as you get to choose if you kill everyone or just those that are needed to proceed with story. Organizing your inventory can also be fun unless you have too many things and not enough space. Some parts of game were less enjoyable than other but that's up to everyone's opinion.\n\nThis game is definitely worthy even at full price but if you are trying to save some money then wait for sale to get it, you won't regret buying it.\n\nSo, do I recomment this game? Fuck yeah go for it, there aren't many survival horror games that are as good as this one is.",Recommended
Leon!!! Heeeeeeeelp!!!,Recommended
"Final Score - 8/10 without the final section of the game. 7/10 with it taken into account.\n\nDefinitely worth a try. I would recommend this one to fans of action and horror in particular.\n\nPROS\n\n- Appropriate music that fits the atmosphere of the game.\n\n- Engaging combat system and interface that keep you immersed within the world at all times.\n\n- Sure, this game has been out and about for many years now, but I honestly feel the visuals aren't anything to scoff at (even for today). They do the job, and playing through in the updated HD mode does help alleviate the growing pains a bit. The visuals also serve the genuine horror atmosphere of the game.\n\nCONS\n\n- Although the music is fitting, its dreary tonality can grow to be grating on your ears the longer you play.\n\n- The story is serviceable and present simply to facilitate the gameplay (the main focus). No Shakespeare here, though you will get some funny/tense moments between characters.\n\n- Quicktime Events. Good luck to those without much dexterity in their fingers. Good luck to those with poor reaction times. These cheap tactics are stuck in to seem like novel moments of interaction. Unfortunately, they come off more as a detriment to the other great gameplay elements.\n\n- Too lengthy. The entire third section of the game (despite some cool moments within) takes away so much from the horror atmosphere and pacing of the game. I feel they should have found a way to end it within the second section, or at least design a better area for the third.\n\nI think efforts should be put into low-price, small-length, unique horror stories rather than games lasting 10+ hours. This particular negative aspect is why it took me so many years and attempts to push myself through this game. I got bored of the world, and tired of the same drab astmosphere it gave me, time after time.\n\nWell, tonight... after many attempts... I've finally surmounted this challenge to myself, and still managed to have a lot of fun along the way!",Recommended

"Despite owning several RE games on Steam through bundles and giveaways and stuff, this is the first one I've played start to finish. I tried playing the RE1 remake but got kind of stuck and gave up. After watching a couple videos gushing about RE4, I gave it a shot. After finishing it just a few days later, I can confidently say this game is incredible.\n\nThe first time I tried to play it was for about an hour in the opening village section. I couldn't get over the aiming and moving mechanics and disliked the mouse acceleration and thought ""fuck this"" and almost uninstalled out of frustration...but didn't. The next day, something made me come back to the game, and I got hooked. I was having an absolute blast, and now that it's over, I want more. \n\nThe ""flow"" of the game is perfect. You find exactly enough money, healing items, weapons, treasures, etc to keep you going but not enough to make you too cocky and comfortable. Enemies are decisively deadly if they get the drop on you or surround you, yet it's still incredibly fun to blast away a horde of them. The bosses are memorable and interesting. The weapon upgrades, along with your increase in comfort with the controls, make it really feel like you've come a long way as a player by the end. You start off with your peashooter, your shaky aim, and a loose grip on how to move Leon, and eventually find yourself running head-on into hordes of enemies with a shotgun just because the combat is so dang fun and satisfying.\n\nSeriously give this game a shot. Get used to the controls, they're odd but feel intentionally implemented this way. You're in for a good time. I had to hold myself back from buying the RE2 remake after finishing this one, but instead bought RE7. Oops.",Recommended

"Awkward review, but basically all I can say is, YES to Resident Evil 4, NO to this crappy PC port. That's the summary, and I'm putting it here so you know that I'm about to praise the heck out of this game but not because it runs well on your computer, no, in fact it runs bad. Baaaad. You could emulate it with an, ahem, very legal copy of RE4 for Wii and get a better control scheme. That's what I did! Worked for me.\n\nSo, don't buy this, DO go play the Wii version.\n\nAll that aside, RE4 is at least a very good game, though it's VERY stupid.\n\nIt's a lot like RE5, which I played first, as in, pretty much they took THIS game and then copy-pasted it into a new file and changed a few assets to get Resident Evil 5: Partners 4 Evar. The basic plot for this game is, Leon is a special forces agent who survived Raccoon City, and Is He a Bad Enough Dude to Kill All the Zombies and Rescue the President's Daughter? (He is.)\n\nYou start off in the most brown place in the world, Spain(?), and immediately you find some villagers who walk very slowly up to you so they can... bite you or hit you with their pathetic little hand scythes or whatever. And that's pretty much all you fight for the rest of the game. They vary it up on occasion, and the dynamic difficulty of the game will scale 'certain' enemies into the mix as a nasty surprise to keep you on your toes almost at random and more and more frequently if you haven't died in a while, but ultimately you just fight dudes. They're not really zombies, they can talk and have most of their motor skills, but they're cunning and obviously still mostly intelligent.\n\nShooting in this version of the game is miserable, I seriously wouldn't try it, just get the Wii version. Weirdly, unlike RE5 there's like four or five different handguns but only one automatic gun, the TMP. It's not really a problem but it sure is odd. It'd be nice to have 'more' but it's not really a problem. I was at least unsatisfied by a lack of unscoped rifles. All of the rifles have a scope and it's restricting. You can buy separate scopes for them anyway, so...?\n\nThere's some pretty good bosses in this game, not too many but a few. RE4 starts a bit weak with the boring old village, some chainsaw guy, nothing very interesting, but there's some great stuff lategame. The Mercenaries mode (time attack survival) is a ton of fun, and some of the characters you can (HUNK HUNK HUNK HUNK) play as are really really awesome. Like Hunk. He has nothing but a TMP and a surplus supply of grenades, and where Leon has a kick and a suplex to deal with staggered enemies, Hunk can just walk up and snap their necks, which is not only fast, it's a one-shot kill AND works on some minibosses. \n\nI don't really know what else to add. The story? It's mostly just nonsense, but there's a few nice grains in there. Ashley, the girl you rescue and who follows you around for a few chapters is charming enough and Leon and her build a nice enough rapport over the course of the game. The bad guy is just laughable. Actually, all of the bad guys are laughable, they make Skeletor look like a professional name-taking badass. Not only are they all worthless, they desperately try and make it look like every time you gun down one of their most useful and valuable henchmen, you're doing them a favour (you're not). They are so incompetent, when Ashley gets caught in a trap and taken away from you, the bad guys themselves go, ""Oh, that wasn't us. But, uh, we'll find her soon! Muahahaha!"" (they never find her)\n\nYeah. Really good game, I guess. Just don't buy the PC port.",Recommended

"Just recently got into this game again on the pc starting about last weekend, and I haven't been able to put it down since. I used to play it on my ps2 all the time, so along the way, plenty of nostalgia was picked up, and it's been one hell of a game to get back into, as of now on my pc playthrough I'm on chapter 5-1, and so far all this game offered has reminded me what a great entry it remains in the resident evil franchise. It'll always be one of my favorites, despite some minor bugs here and there with the qte events on pc, I'll always love it dearly... \n\n-Also, I'm sure everyone can agree Salazar made you want to shoot him dead several times, but you could nothing about it until he became a monstrosity...F",Recommended
"One of my favorite games of all time and has been since I was a kid. This game is just so much fun. So many memorable areas in the game, every single room in the game was created with passion and it shows. \n\nThere are areas that have no reason to exist, but that makes them all the better. The developers were clearly enjoying themselves and put fun before logic (yet not entirely). For example, there is an place in Chapter 4-1 which is a huge room filled with lava and there are Ganados manning stone dragons bound to chains which spit fire on you, all so you can go up the steps and grab a goat ornament relief to put into a wall so it will go back into the ground and you can progress. It makes absolutely no sense, yet it is amazing. It will be forever etched in my mind, just like every other area in the game.\n\nThe Ganados could be scarier with more variety but the boss design and some of the more ""special"" enemies are truly horrific. Some of the best in all of RE. There are many boss fights throughout the game and they are all unique\n\nYes, this game is more action focused, but it has a lot of tension. The pacing is perfect. No matter how much I play it, I never get bored. Very addicting gameplay. And the RE4 HD Project mod makes the game look gorgeous, and every detail shines. \n\nThis is one game that will stand the test of time, as it has thus far. There is so much passion in everything here. The cutscenes are directed brilliantly..and no matter how short they are...they are just so full of...life. I don't know how else to explain it. \n\nThe sound design is very good, and it has an excellent soundtrack. The save theme and merchant theme are beyond amazing.\n\nThe character design is excellent, the voice-acting is flawless. The inventory and merchant make the game all the better. This is the game that taught me to be neat and orderly by constantly rearranging my attache case.\n\nI love this game with all my heart. And I always will.",Recommended

"This game is really awesome. Must have in your library if you're a fan of Resident Evil series and especially of Leon Kennedy. First time I've played it on PC like at 2010 and I spend playing like entire day, despite super-weird controls and some questionable mechanics. \n\nHere's short list of main pros & cons in my opinion;\npros:\n - Addictive gameplay & plot\n - Broad weapon selection, possibility to modify its stats, and upgrade some of them using attachments\n - Game's length in general\n - Challenging\n - Cool 3 additional scenarios (which unlocked once you finish the game on any difficulty)\n - If you're doing well, game become harder and the opposite, so you won't get bored once you cleared a part without any troubles, and if you're struggling, game loose up difficulty a little bit, so you won't get frustrated as hell\n - Cool one liners like ""LEEEEON! HELP! HELP MEEEEEE!"" and over and over again (god that girl was annoying as f**k sometimes)\n - Nice puzzles. Not the dumbest, and not that hard at the same time\n\ncons: \n - Smashing keyboard/mouse combinations aka QTE's. The only thing which game can't make easier + 60 fps and console port don't help the situation. Sometimes you'll need to smash buttons a little bit earlier the game request to do so. I've experienced some troubles with QTE's only in latest missions of chapter 4, but a lot of people haven't at all, so it depends I guess\n - Despite I was doing well, the bosses were somehow weak for my taste (normal difficulty), especially the last one which  apparently is main antagonist in the game\n - Strange headshot system. I've already mentioned about difficulty tweaking on the course, but I don't think that makes clear why the same type of NPC's are insta-headshoted with one, or 3 or 4 bullets in a row in the same location and scenario. Later on I picked up a trick how to surely decapitate your enemy safely, but still, my guess that it's just randomized\n - Merchant sales a ton of stuff and upgrades, but not an ammo. At all. Which strange a bit, and sometimes, very frustrating\n\nOn my configuration (i7-7700HQ + GTX1060 + 16GB RAM) I have experienced ~0,5sec lag before cutscene each time, but nothing more than that. \n\nIn general, despite some moments, RE4 is literally gem. Fun, addictive and thrilling. Once I have a chance, I'll give it one more go on higher difficulty. \n\nSo, 9 darth-maul-like-monks out of 10, I guess",Recommended
"I have recently come to find that Resident Evil 4 holds its place in my heart as #1 for my all time favorite video games. \n\nThe Campaign is just outright badass as well as the protagonist Leon S. Kennedy. While it may not add a lot to the main Resident Evil lore, it doesn't matter. The unique firearm selection ( as well as the powerhouse-esque upgrades you can acquire for said guns) are easily able to keep me killing ͏s͏hi͏t for hours on end without any boredom. The soundtrack does a great job at setting the vibe and ambiance for RE4's atmosphere. The best and most important thing to note is Resident Evil 4's level progression in each map.[b]SPOILER ALERT:[/b][spoiler]The way you travel from village to village to Salazar's Castle and eventually the island is just so enjoyable and big props to the devs for that as well as re-texturing everything in HD[/spoiler]. All of these factors combined make for total replay value as you can unlock new weapons and accessories when you start a new game. I am currently on my 7th play through of this game. I have beaten it on the GameCube, Xbox 360, PC, and the lite mobile version for the IPhone. And while I love previous entries as much as 4, Four takes the crown for how much enjoyment and time I've put into it. I loved 5 albeit not as much since it felt like a dulled down version of 4. I digress...\n\nFrom it's fantastic linear story/game play, to the variety and difficulty of enemies, finding sought after treasures,  to the creepy parts like when you fight the regenerators, to Capcom's corny Dialogue in cut scenes (a staple of the Resident Evil Franchise) to the side modes (Mercenaries, Separate ways, the bottle-cap mini-games in the main story which I never bothered with), this game is worth (and lives up to) it's 20 dollar price tag if not more. I definitely recommend Resident Evil 4 to anyone no matter what your favorite genre may be :steamhappy:.\n\n\n\n[i]muere, muere, muere...[/i]",Recommended

I definatly would recommend this game if you can get past the controls.",Recommended
"After I managed to mess around with the settings, I got the game to run probably as smooth as it's going to. \n\nEither way, this game is still amazing. I can't express how much I love playing it.

Even when I first got it on Steam, it stressed me out so bad but the story is amazing and I couldn't stop!! \n\n\n10/10 Love RE.",Recommended

Ashley will follow you, duck out of your way, and follow commands.\n-The merchant is fair and nice. Don't kill him.\n\nCons:\n-Can get ridiculously challenging in some parts, especially if one isn't well equipped.\n-even though it uses the HD graphics from the PS3 version, the blury textures leave a lot to be desired.

"A classic title for many, but not one that I personally enjoyed, everything about the game for me played well, and felt incredible up until the game turns into a escort quest.\n\nI guess it's ironic considering the whole concept of the narrative is built around the idea of rescuing someone, but the controls, and the situations in which the game places you in are quite frustrating after a while, it is already difficult to take care of yourself, only to add another aspect of frustration to the experience by also having to look after the well being of a non-controllable npc.\n\nYou can only tell that npc to wait for you or to follow you, my usual strategy at first was to tell her to wait before I started an area, cleared the area of enemies, and then ask her to follow me, but after a while this ""tactic"" stopped working given that the game spawns random enemies around her position if you leave her after a while, even if it didn't, and what really happened was that some enemies escaped my eye and ended up reaching her position I still would call this a system, or mechanic that I find satisfying, and sadly, it starts at about a quarter into the game, and last for a very, very long time, up until the end I believe unless my memory betrays me.\n\nThere's also the quick time events which are annoying, but, again, nowhere near as annoying as having most of the game turn into a escort quest.\n\nUp to that point I was having a blast with this game, loved the systems, controls, atmosphere, graphics, gameplay mechanics, everything really...\n\nJust this one thing, it ""killed it"" for me.",Not Recommended

"When it came out, Resident Evil 4 was an iconic advancement for the survival horror genre, if not for third-person action games in general. Though like many other games that were innovative for their time it hasn't aged with much grace, its odd blend of action and horror is still quite fun.\n\n[h1]The Gameplay[/h1]\n\nRE4's core gameplay is pretty solid; It mixes the slow-paced combat and movement of classic RE with some modern shooter mechanics, forming a methodical and strategic tone to the combat that meshes well with the small map sizes and horror themes. Needing to stand still to aim/shoot makes dealing with enemies a tense experience, but your guns still have enough kick to them that you don't feel overly vulnerable from the restriction. Rather than the more common survival-horror tone of being in-over-your-head and barely scraping through each encounter, you feel like a professional thrust into an extra-challenging situation, and though it sometimes pushes it to the point that I barely felt like I was ""surviving"" the horrors inasmuch as I was just badassing my way through them, it was a neat change of pace compared to the rest of the genre.\n\nHowever, it hits some significant hangups with its controls, which have aged like cheese left outdoors in the summer. Tank controls work okay until you're actually trying to use them in combat, at which point maneuvering around becomes a clunky, awkward mess due to how imprecise and sluggish your movements are. This is especially apparent if you're trying to dodge around enemies due to the lack of evasive actions beyond ""try to move past them"". Bosses often use attacks that trigger a QTE, but the window to input these is incredibly small, and they'll sometimes just outright fail to appear if your position isn't just right, leading to unavoidable damage. You need to pause and open your inventory to switch weapons, awkwardly breaking the otherwise intense pace of the combat, and your laser sight is significantly offset from the center of the camera, which makes aiming pretty awkward. To credit, the controls aren't -terrible-, but even after I'd had time to get used to all of their oddities I still found them rearing up to cause frustration semi-regularly.\n\n[h1]The Enemy & Item Design[/h1]\n\nBy far its strongest point, the sheer number of fully fleshed-out enemy types you'll encounter across the game is just phenomenal. The regular infected humans sport an incredible variety of weapons and armors, gradually upping the stakes from villagers with pitchforks, dynamite, and throwing hatchets, to cultists with flails and crossbows, or soldiers with shock rods and bulletproof masks, all of whom have a chance for their heads to pop into a variety of deadly giant parasites, and there's a huge variety in combat encounters just from all the ways they can mix up groups of humans.\n\nMonsters range from basic (albeit still creepy) infected dogs, to bestial giant bugs or the disturbingly humanoid Regenerators, bringing with them a host of unique mechanics such as camouflage or weak points only visible through an infrared scope. There's nearly a dozen unique bosses, most of whom are humans who've undergone grotesque mutations, and the reaches of creativity the devs reach with the body horror is nothing short of fantastically terrifying.\n\nNearly every enemy type has a number of unique reactions depending on where you shoot them, and both regular enemies and bosses have plenty of variety to their attacks, so everything feels like a genuine threat, and even the weakest of enemy types escape feeling like fodder. From the perspective of action shooters, this is a huge breath of fresh air compared to the genre's often one-track enemy designs.\n\nYour own arsenal is likewise quite impressive. Most gun archetypes (e.g. pistol, shotgun) have 2-3 variants (even more, if you count NG+ unlocks), and rather than going for new guns being straight improvements, each new weapon is a sidegrade that brings new options to the table (such as a shotgun having tighter pellet spread). You're given frankly ridiculous amounts of inventory space, but this means you'll get the opportunity to try out plenty of weapon combinations to help keep combat interesting.\n\n[h1]The Balance[/h1]\n\nRE4 is much more actioney than survival-horrorey, and this is most apparent with how they balance the combat. The game quite literally throws over a thousand enemies at you over the course of the story, and you're given piles of ammo to deal with them, to the point that to actually run low you'd have to have some stupendously bad aim. For the most part it actually uses these large enemy counts quite effectively, using the enemy variety to constantly give you new and challenging encounters, often throwing in special environmental hazards (such as catapults, tripwire bombs, or bear traps) to further mix things up, and it manages to keep the pressure on without making you feel unfairly overwhelmed. It's a damn long game (my main save clocked 22 hours, but said time ignores time lost due to deaths), yet it never felt like it was dragging on due to the sheer amount of variation and solid challenge it had packed into it.\n\nIf I have some major complaints, there are a few areas where there's multiple waves of reinforcements that spawn, and such areas tend to slog on annoyingly, on top of the reinforcement spawning being so utterly wonky that -you can be inside of a room with only one entrance, facing the door, and enemies can phase into existence behind you-, but thankfully these encounters are few and far-between. Smaller encounters were sometimes blazingly easy due to human enemies being very simple to deal with if there's only 1-3 of them, and a number of the bosses have easy-to-discover cheeses (one basically can't hit you if you don't move from your starting position, and most of them can be instantly killed with an RPG), and even the ones that don't never reach particularly satisfying amounts of challenge.\n\nAlso Ashley is fine. Her pathfinding doesn't get stuck, enemies tend to pick her up to slowly walk towards exits rather than just kill her, and 9/10 times you can just have her stand in a corner or hide in a dumpster while you deal with enemies, plus she's not actually with you for much of the game. Overall I felt the need to change your strategies a bit to keep her safe actually helped add to the variety.\n\n[h1]The Story[/h1]\n \nIt's like a cheesy B-movie, replete with silly one-liners and over-the-top acrobatics/explosions during the cutscenes, while still remaining just grounded enough that you can get invested in the cast. The plot is standard ""stop the bad man from using virus for world domination"" secret agent stuff, but having an original villain with their own ambitions who isn't involved with Umbrella is a welcome change.\n\n[h1]The Graphics/Sound[/h1]\n\nThough the color palette is pretty washed out, there's still an impressive variety of environments to explore, and the updated texture work of this version holds up nicely. Enemies have some fantastic modeling and animation, especially considering the game's age. Sound design isn't amazing, but neither is it bad by any means, and the soundtrack is pretty good, leaning more towards actioney orchestral tracks than spooky horror stuff.\n\n[h1]In Closing[/h1]\n\nAt the end of the day, RE4 is far more an action shooter with survival-horror elements than the other way around. When I went in expecting the opposite I was disappointed, but once I started to play it for what it is it really grew on me. It was groundbreaking for its time, and this is still apparent in spite of the flaws age has made more apparent. If you're an RE fan it's an essential play, and still quite enjoyable if you want a change of pace compared to the modern conventions of either genre.\n\n8/10\n\nFollow my [url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/31984244/]Curator[/url] to be kept up on all my reviews, including stuff I ghost-write through Family Share!",Recommended

Amazing game my favorite resident evil by far but resident evil 2 is a close second. This game has a great story its nice to have a game more based around other things besides horror if you ever want an RE game that doesn't really have much  to do with horror this is the game for you. Ill admit this game can be a lot like an action movie but who dislike a bit of switch to action in their games. If you asking if you should get this game absolutely it is an amazing game don't watch anything on it just complete the game blind.

"A very clever game - one that I was glad to overcome my aversion to horror games for.\n\nRE4 builds well-balanced scenarios of suspense, action, and learning that tempt me to label it as a strategy game. Resource management and inventory organization get you more involved in shooting. Misses, reloads, and your immobility while aiming add a refreshing pressure to gunplay.\n\nCombat encounters contain distinct points that reward player observation, foresight, and planning. A variety of weapons and upgrades ask you to make important decisions on how best to tackle the obstacles ahead.\n\nAlongside this, there are plenty of unique set pieces that add flavor and memorable moments to each chapter. A few of these features can build off one another, but they never feel tiresomely recycled. This was a little stunning given that many games choose to get as much out of a segment as possible.\n\nOne serious pitfall for the game is its notorious placement of unexpected quick-time events during unassuming cutscenes. A few poorly placed QTE's can even totally kill you at the end of gameplay segments. You can learn to see them coming, but they do feel out of place.\n\nFurthermore, RE4's tank controls, while integral to the game, can take some time to get used to. Despite movement initially feeling sluggish, RE4 can still be fast-paced with slower motions becoming obstacles to plan around.\n\nThe story balances a level of over-the-top action and cheesy voice acting with moments of intense and serious suspense. Overall, the narrative is part of what makes RE4 a treat to play through.\n\nEven if horror games aren't your style, I'd urge you to play RE4. The game has visible traces of carefully designed elements and, as someone who spends too much time thinking about these things, it's great to see a game be so honest about how it operates.\n\n[i]Side Note: There are plenty of different versions of RE4 out there. Given its accessibility, I stuck with the PC version although I am uncertain if it is considered the definitive edition. However, the chance to play the Wii version which operates quite differently.[/i]",Recommended

"I can't believe it took me 15 years to finally play this but I have to say - it's a beautiful piece of work. RESIDENT EVIL 4 makes some controversial changes from its predecessors, namely switching from a fixed-camera perspective to a third-person over the shoulder view, while also shifting the focus of the series from survival horror to a more action-oriented horror. This would only get worse with Resident Evil's 5 & 6, though RE4 thankfully still manages to find a sweet spot between player empowerment and vulnerability. The enemies are still pretty freaky, particularly those damned Regenerators that appear in the second half of the game. The boss fights are more creative, and the writing is much more improved even if the game still doesn't take itself too seriously.",Recommended
one of the best game ever,Recommended
"Some games age like a fine wine, Resident Evil 4 has aged like milk, and the PC port in particular has turned to cottage cheese.\n\nResident Evil 4, considered both the savior and murderer of the survival horror genre. It injected fresh air into (at the time) a series that was still going strong yet was feeling somewhat formulaic in design by nearly completely changing how the game worked.\n\nTo really understand what is going on with RE4 you have to know its backstory in that it was remade several times in development, its early versions actually being repackaged and spawning other Capcom series like Devil May Cry and Haunting Ground. The problem from this isn't obvious but its clear those influences stayed in the final game, most prominently Devil May Cry's Campiness is all over RE4. \n\nThe ""cool"" hero, sarcastically blowing away otherworldly horrors is deeply ingrained in the RE4 version of Leon, and frankly took away all horror from the game, why be afraid when my character isn't? Monsters that would ordinarily be horrifying end up being a joke, the only bosses that maintains any sense of horror are the ones that don't retain any human personality and thus Leon can't have a snarky retort with to take out the sense of danger, even if the danger is there.\n\nThe next major change that separates 4 from its brethren of the time was its full 3d transformation. Up until that point main entry REs were a 3d character over 2d environments, there were REs that went 3d before 4, but 4 was the first main entry. Because of this, I really attribute 4 to having ""Final Fantasy 7"" syndrome, graphically wowing people over at the time so people forgave its many flaws and mistakes. With the graphical changes also of course the gameplay would change to far more action orientated pace, gone was any fear of a single foe, it takes mobs to threaten Leon due to all the tools at leon's disposal, from grenades, many many guns, to the worst culprit of all, the counters. Melee countering is what makes Leon far too powerful to instill any fear in the game. When you can ""counter waltz"" from one enemy to the next to cross a map, you feel like a superhero, not a person fighting for their life.\n\nThe last major change/mistake is not necessarily the fault of game or Capcom, but rather a fad that was sweeping the industry at the time, the QTE or Quick Time Event. QTEs were a industry idea of trying to keep the player engaged even during cut scenes by putting in quick interactions that if you failed you died and had to retry. There's several things wrong with this thinking; ""so you don't want me to watch the cutscene?"" if you're always on edge waiting for a QTE you're not watching the cutscene in a normal manner that lets you absorb the story. Second problem is you die and retry, do you like seeing the first 30seconds of a cutscene over and over and over? Imagine if you were watching a movie and if you didn't press up on your remote when it said fast enough, you had to go through the opening credit crawl again again and again. Lastly, QTEs were used a lot for ""press button for awesome"" instead of the act of actually having to fight they would substitute QTEs for something that would be too hard to code into the game. So the character could QTE, do amazing action instead of you having to physically do the action, and the game looks ""cool"". There's a problem of feeling fake in this, you don't feel a genuine sense of victory.\n\nSo that's the major problems with RE4, now we get to the steam/PC version itself which is absolute garbage. ""Port"" describes this game perfect, barely any advanced options are present in the game, I was amazed mouse aim was even in even if its lacking. I had to edit config files to be able to turn with the mouse and thus make the game feel smooth and natural. There's also a very known issue that if you run the game at 60fps it makes some QTE actions essentially impossible cause it raises the threshold for how many button presses needed to an impossible to keep up with amount. You can fix this for dropping the frame rate down to 30 for these sections, which while this means you can reach the end of the game, its rather shitty.\n\nResident Evil 4 would set in motion problems with the series that would nearly kill the series and plague it largely up till RE6 and still cause residual effects to this day. My nostalgia goggles are off with this game and if given the chance I'd go back and unmake this game.",Not Recommended

"This is actually my first time playing through Resident Evil 4 on the PC, but I've owned and beaten it on the PS2, PS3, and Xbox One respectively and I can say from experience it's a Recommended gem of a horror game. It is the fourth installment in the resident evil/ biohazard franchise and the second game in the series to feature fan favorite (and mine as well) special agent Leon S. Kennedy as he tries to track down the president's daughter after she was kidnapped by a religious cult who use the las plagas parasite to control the common people and use them as mind controlled slaves. These infected by the parasite will serve as the primary antagonists (along a whole mess of different mutated creatures including a giant fish monster that lives in a lake) for Leon as he attempts to locate and rescue Ashley Graham. I always found Resident Evil 4 to be my personal favorite in the franchise, with dark and beautiful graphics, the best characters in the franchise, plenty of iconic action and puzzle solving moments, and loads of truly spooky/ horrifying stages that will leave you not wanting to play this game in the dark. This is one of those games that is so lengthy, every time you think you've got it beat, you learn you've just started a new area on the island. A must own for fans of horror games and zombie lovers everywhere. And the PC version has the added benefit of being much easier to play than other console versions due to the mouse and the position of the controls. Resident evil 4 is one of my top ten favorite games of all time, and Leon Kennedy is my personal favorite video game character of all time. And after you beat the game, there are other story-lines that you unlock, and special outfits and weapons for Leon that give this game a ton of replay value. 10/10.",Recommended

Amazing game!!! The story is incredible and keyboard controls are a bit wonky at first but you eventually get used to them. The characters really draw you in and keep you playing. Also you never know when a guy will appear behind you and occasionally make you jump. Be prepared to mash x on the keyboard so fast your keyboard breaks. 10/10,Recommended
"one of the best RE games ever! loved the game! i also used the HD Project Mode which makes the game gorgeous, gameplay is really smooth and enjoyable, puzzles are not frustrating and also not too much complicated either, boss fights are completely balanced and your AI friend is not stupid too, game's economy system is also well implemented and you can buy almost whatever you like with just a little grinding, just a little :) there's also some side stories in the game which will be unlocked after you beat the game, and playing those parts is kinda cool too. absolutely amazing!",Recommended

The negative reviews are from people having issues with the port which is understandable. I personally have had no problems with the port so this doesn't apply to me. The game itself is a pure masterpiece and one of the best games ever created. Not so much a horror game[spoiler](except for the regenerators)[/spoiler] as other resident evils but what makes it the classic that it is known for today is the tension and atmosphere.  The controls take some time to get used to but when you do you actually enjoy them.,Recommended

"Get this game for an actual console.\n\nThe mouse controls are clunky, difficult to learn, and non-intuitive. you can change the shooting mode to be more ""modern"", but that's it. I expect to be able to choose where I'm looking based on where I aim the mouse. This is not the case. Movement and which direction you face is done ONLY using the wasd keys, so I have to pretend wasd is a joystick, and this is difficult for a fast paced game such as RE4 (I've played many hours of this on the Gamecube).\n\nI tried using a Steelseries 3GC controller, and that fixed my aiming problem (and should have made this game a-ok and perfect to play at that point, but it did not). when I ready my weapon to shoot using the gaming controller, I am unable to aim the gun at all, so if i wanted to reposition, i'd have to unready my weapon, move, and hope my aim was 100% accurate when I wanted to shoot.\n\nTherefore, my options are inability for my brain to account for asinine mouse/keyboard controls, or a controller that makes  aiming, in a shooting game, impossible.\n\nI do NOT recommend the PC port of this game. The game, on a console, is one of the few shooters I have actually enjoyed and gone back to. \n\nMy review of an actually playable version of the game is as follows: the story is fun and paced well, the enemies are challenging and scale well. I have so many fond memories of the characters (even the annoying ones). The enemies weren't scary for the most part (though they looked pretty cool), but the regenerators literally got my heart rate pumping and induced a strong stress feeling and I both loved and hated it. Ashley will annoy the hell out of you, but hey, she gives you something to complain about, and you're not stuck with her the whole game. \n\nI really really wanted to be able to play this port of the game. Play it on the Playstation, gamecube, literally ANYWHERE but this poorly setup PC-port.",Not Recommended

The maps look great and they give off a better horror vibe that I didn't get as much in Resident Evil 5 and 6.\n\n I have a few complaints though, with one being there's no way to quickly swap weapons. You will need to open your inventory every time but at least it pauses the game. You also cannot sidestep, A and D will just turn Leon. I've also never understood why the game offers new weapons for purchase such as the Magnum, yet 90% of the time you only get ammo drops for the handgun, shotgun, and rifle. Nevertheless, great game.",Recommended

If this doesn't deter you, the it's a good game to play.\n\nThe good:\n* HD, isn't amazing but looks better than the original.\n* Most game play mechanics still hold up, the boss fights/puzzles/difficulty.\n* Story was interesting, though super cheesy.\n\nThe bad:\n* The quick button mashing events.

"[b]Resident Evil 4[/b] is a survival horror game, though it replaces the survival part with action in the middle of the game. You play as Leon S. Kennedy, he got a new job as a special agent and his task is to find President's daughter. The intel says that she's being held by some strange cult in a god forgotten village in Spain, so you set out there and immediately get attacked by cultists, who behave a lot like zombies from the previous games. It's an engaging premise and the story has a lot of unexpected turns. It's more interesting than in the previous games, though this comes at price. \n\nThe gameplay was changed in order to accomodate for a new story-based approach. So levels now are set in a linear order, no more exploring the same location and solving puzzles. Sometimes you comeback to the previously visited locations, but it doesn't feel like you're backtracking, because you are being led there by a game's story. Another big change from previous Resident Evil games, is that you have to actually aim your gun at the enemy. Shooting is done very well, enemies react to shots to different body parts and headshots feel statisfying. But this change also comes at a price, now there are a whole lot more zombies and most of the time you have to kill every single one of them. Then there's another controversial feature - QTE. Most of the cutscenes don't feature it, even though your character might fight someone in the cutscene, so most of the time you will put your controller aside while watching the movie, but there will be times when you have to press buttons in time or your character will die and you'll have to start over. It would have been better if they gave you warning before cutscene, that there will be QTEs or used it in every cutscene, so that you will always be waiting for it.\n\nSwitching from pre-rendered backgrounds to full 3d made the game look more modern, though most of the locations now feel the same. Copy-pasted houses and rooms can be seen with a naked eye. There aren't any memorable locations like in previous games, but that may be because of the graphics palette, everything looks gray and depressing. This makes for some dark creepy atmosphere. Voice acting is much better than in the previous games, but the dialogue feels badly written, though funny in way. \n\n[b]Pros:[/b]\n+ Fun gunplay\n+ Engaging story\n+ Funny dialogue\n+ Great action set pieces\n+ Epic boss battles\n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n- Unexpected and some unreasonably hard QTEs\n- A lot of shooting, no way to run past enemies\n\nEven though this game is nothing like the previous Resident Evils, it is a great game, that can be enjoyed by series fans as well as newcomers. \n\n",Recommended

"Probably the best game in the franchise (this and RE2 remake which was amazing in every aspect).I loved the story,the main character and all of the sub characters,most of the villains (Salazar is a bitch),the large map and the three different locations you visit throughout the campaign.Lots of stuff to explore,many collectibles lying around and a merchant that lets you upgrade your stuff by selling artifacts etc.It gets harder as you progress through the game especially in the last area where you are usually outgunned so running becomes an excellent option.This is a game all people should play whether they are fans of the series or not,because it is a quality and quantity game (pretty lengthy) and delivers in every possible way.",Recommended
"Fantastic game, best RE game in my opinion!",Recommended
"Amazing game, even for being 13-14 years old now. Story hasn't aged a bit and everything works flawlessly.. although the controls can make some areas cheap, especially on Professional. This game has the traditional tank controls, except now you have a dynamic camera which is AMAZING. If for some reason you haven't played this game, there's basically no excuse anymore. It's on the Gamecube, PS2, Wii, has been ported to every modern console, on here on Steam and a random Brazilian console I've never heard of till now. There's even an iOS version which, despite it not being great, is still RE4 at heart. I wouldn't say it's a game that'd scare you shitless, but it definitely can spook you and has plenty of intense moments like the holdout with Luis to the fight with El Gigante to the Knights when you play as Ashley.\n\nJust get it, you wont regret it.",Recommended

"The ""thumbs down"" is not for the game but for the pc port and mainly for the various glitches that will test your patience and determination to finish the game.\n- Frame Rate problems that may make it unplayble, and require file customization and search\n-Crushes for no reason\n-The quick time events that require pushing certain buttons don't always work and you need to search everything on internet to make it work\nI spotted these so far 16 hours in game without finishing.

"Time has not been kind to this game. Leon wanders rural Spain with the speed and dexterity of a King Tiger with one track shot off. I see what the devs were going for, but it just comes off as awkward and sluggish.\nThe ""HD retexture"" looks passable where present, but half of the textures haven't been touched, Combined with the Playstation 2 era low res menus and text, this gives the visuals all the charm of a half finished fan project. \nWant to put your controller down for a minute to enjoy a dialog cutscene? big mistake champ, Shenmue-on-Dreamcast style quicktime events hide around every corner to ensure you need to reload your saves over and over. And just in case you think you got the idea of what you needed to do, the devs made sure the quicktime event controls change randomly to keep you guessing. Speaking of enjoying dialog cutscenes, it looks like the voice sync was done on a Friday afternoon right before knockoff, because the lip movements happen 2-3 seconds after the sound. \nThe air of tension is maintained with the aid of the soundtrack, which loops loudly whenever enemies are nearby. It is my firm belief that all music and sound effects were recorded in mono on a boombox inside a trashcan. And then compressed until unrecognisable. The exception to this is the loud and out of place bing-bing-wahoo sounds made when you collect an item, which resounds with the kind of fidelity and amplitude to make an audiophile weep. Plot advancement comes in the form of Solid Snake style two-way video chats between Leon and his waifu, who generously explains the advancement of the (uninteresting) plot for developmentally challenged players.\nIf this game was about a third of the price, it would be a quaint wander back to a time when cathode ray tubes and dual shock controllers were the cutting edge, and I'd probably give it a thumbs up. As it is right now, I'd pass on it and play the RE and RE2 remakes until this one gets the inevitable makeover.",Not Recommended

"The first time I played [i]Resident Evil 4[/i], or [i]RE4[/i], was on Nintendo GameCube, circa 2005. It was incredibly mindblowing how good the graphics were, compared to the Playstation 2's [i]Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater[/i] that was launched a year before. That was also the first time I had enough courage to finish a title from the [i]biohazard[/i] franchise, not because [i]RE4[/i] is less scary than the prior titles, but for the first time I felt like I was playing an excellent game.\n\nThe game design in general and CAPCOM's execution was flawlessly superb: the atmosphere is astoundingly tense and creepy, the variety of enemies, weapons, combat mechanics, environment details... [i]RE4[/i] simply reinvented the third-person shooters with its over-the-shoulder camera angle becoming the gold-standard for the genre. The list of great titles influenced by [i]RE4[/i] includes [i]Gears of War[/i], [i]Mass Effect[/i], [i]Uncharted[/i], [i]The Last of Us[/i], and much more. \n\nDespite being good, [i]RE4[/i] also caused a lot of problems for CAPCOM at that time. Doing a shift from prior titles, [i]RE4[/i] unfortunately killed the classic survival-horror genre from older [i]Resident Evil[/i] titles. Every game that came after it had serious design issues just because of how good [i]RE4[/i]'s presentation was, even its successors [i]RE5[/i] and [i]RE6[/i].

"[h1][b]Resident Evil 4[/b][/h1]\n[b][i]A Diamond in the Dust[/i]\n\nIn short:[/b]\nIs RE:4 Good? No.\nIs RE:4 Great? Yes.\nShould you buy it? Well...\n\nFirst off let me say that this is my first time playing this game, I have no nostalgia towards this entry or the entire franchise for that matter. This was my first experience with Resident Evil as a franchise, or playing it at least; so if you're looking for an unbiased review for the modern day, here it is.\n\n[i][b]Gameplay[/b][/i]\n\nRE:4 Is a great game that plays well all things considered. From the very first hour I was hooked right in and after a period of two days this game was all I played from start to finish. Once the action starts it rarely lets up and around almost every corner there is something waiting for you.\n\nI've heard a lot about the infamous ""tank controls"" and camera being an absolute pain coupled with the fact that you can't move while aiming your weapon which has lead to a fair bit of frustration it seems. Personally I think it works in the games favour. The tight camera and controls start off sluggish but once you learn how to deal with them they become less of a problem and start working with the atmosphere to create a more terrifying experience. The idea that there are clear and present threats around you that will send you back to the last checkpoint, or deplete your healing reserves looming towards you and you can't just flick around and strafe shoot until the whole room is cleared is tense and exciting. \n\nYou have to strategize. Plan your movement and shots in a confined space, because if you fail you're back to the last typewriter or checkpoint losing potentially 10's of minutes progress and the game will actively keep track and remind you of your total deaths throughout. It's the good type of horror, the one where you fear the world because there is that anxiety of messing up; not having enough ammo, needing to quickly turn because that chainsaw guys is *right* behind you; not because a pre-animated sequence catches you by surprise screaming at 90db.\n\n[i][b]Story/Narrative[/b][/i]\n\nWhat about the story? Yeah it's good too, it's fairly simplistic and you'll likely see all the twists before they even happen. It's campy and cheesy which was a good laugh and a nice change of pace from game narratives now-a-days (almost) always taking themselves so seriously, trying to become some sort of ""The Dark Knight"" of video game narratives. There are also many memorable moments and environments that'll stick with you after playing. It's probably not the best part of the game but a noteable one none the less.\n\n[b]""So, you like the gameplay, the story and even some things the nostalgics dislike about it; so why the 'negative' review?""[/b]\n\nWell, despite the good the game offers, I have to say that at $29.95AU, it's not worth it. By today's standards and as well by its own standards in some areas, I simply cannot recommend that players who have not yet played this acclaimed 'masterpiece' do so for what is on steam a moderate price tag for a fair few recent releases.\n\nA huge problem I have with the game is how strenuous it is to play for long periods of time. Calling this an ""Ultimate HD Edition"" is pretty cocky even for something 'released' in 2014. For some reason the game never shipped with full English subtitles and they never patched them in with this release and on top of that there are no audio controls. None. And the game insists on booting as loud as possible and staying that loud for however long, coupled with some of the soundtrack meant to emphasize the threatening nature of the enemies you'll fight by playing a low pounding instrument, gave me a pounding headache (also possibly because of the audio just being dated overall and playing them through new surround sound headphones). \n\nNot to mention the fact that possibly a third, likely even at least half of the textures/models aren't updated from the original 2005 Gamecube release or will barely look it. The actual character models look clean and polished along with the weapon models but they just contrast horribly to the blurry low res environments that just become sickly to look at on anything above 1920x1080 (which is the native res of nearly all relatively new monitors). \n\nAlso, speaking of weapon models, all the rifle animations are in 30FPS rather than 60, so every time you reload a rifle you're treated to the most janky display I cannot describe that really takes you out of the games immersion. That's not all either. Because of the rapid jump the devs made to push the game to 60FPS (which you can only change in the main menu and will lose progress unless saved at a save point, not checkpoint*) the various and plentiful QTE's around the game will play faster than they appear, meaning you will fail them several times, (sometimes) no matter how much you spam the key input required. A simple fix is switch the game to 30FPS via the main menu, but again, because of the push to 60, the shooting and movement will feel less responsive because the game is effectively being slowed down (when played in 30) which will also affect the AI making the game either becomes easier or harder depending on how many frames you're getting.\n\nNow to be fair there is a *massive* HD overhaul mod that the creators (of which there are two) have painstakingly created with photorealism; which is absolutely fantastic and well done to them; however the file size is between 19 and 30 Gig, which will be a problem for people with smaller hard drives (like people wanting to play it on a laptop for on the go like other older games) and also slow internet or limited internet speeds/usage so be weary if that's you. Additionally, because this is for PC I imagine there are other mods in existence that will likely fix some of the other issues listed above so there is a saving grace if you are willing to apply some extra time and effort to jury rig the game to working more suitable for modern equipment. That being said, once again ""$29.95"". For that money you could buy Fallout: New Vegas (a comparable game to RE:4 in terms of mod requirements and overall quality imo) with all DLC's for *HALF* the price.\n\n[i][b]Summary/Conclusion[/b][/i]\n\nOverall, RE:4 *was* a great masterpiece sure. If you're an old fan with great nostalgia for this game I can see it being worth the time and money to get playing. By today's standards however, it needs work, a fair bit of it and for the asking price you can buy so many newer and even older games that require much less and probably won't give you as much nausea (as it gave me). If after all I've said you're still really keen to experience this game, Vinny (Vinesauce) did a great stream a few months back (and it's on his ""Fullsauce"" channel) *with* the HD mod installed so it might be worth your while to check out that instead and then make a decision; and after maybe you'll save some money for other games.",Not Recommended

"Decided to pick this up and catch up on story after playing the RE:2 remake.\n\nControls are stiff in comparison, but easy enough to quickly get used to. Need a controller though, I can't imagine trying this on a keyboard. Much more action orientated, far less survival horror. If you are good with your shots you'll likely never even get close to being low on ammo on normal. Has a New Game+ feature so you can carry your money and gear over from your previous play-through. Companion AI isn't actually too bad.\n\nI believe 3 mini-games unlock after you finish. One is story related, the other two are skill/time trial games. Replay isn't super high, but enough that I'm going to speed through the main story a time or two again to save up enough to buy the infinite rocket launcher, just for fun.

"Resident Evil 4 is a great game but a weird one when you think about it. \n\nCapcom ditched the survival horror and went more for a more action packed approach. You can say that Code Veronica was to blame for this since that game was a bit more action focused but it still was a survival horror game at its core. Gone are the static camera angles, instead replaced with a over the shoulder view which allows you to aim wherever you want instead of forward, up and down like in the previous installments. The game also doesn’t feature zombies, they are instead replaced with “ganado’s”. These look like humans and act like humans, they are just infected with a parasite with curtain members having a queen parasite which gives them control over the others . \n\nYou would think that stripping away the most essential things of what makes a RE game a RE game would make it a bad RE game. But it’s anything but that. The game is fun and the gameplay is excellent. The controls can be weird at first, but they are easy to get used to. The game is also cheesy as hell. Not that the previous games where really serious but this game takes it to a whole other level. The dialog is far too cheesy. Certainty between Leon and Salazar. It can be really cringy at times but is has a charm to it.\n\nAnd I think that it is this charm that makes this game so great. It still is seen as one of the best games ever made and there are still many people that play this game to this day. I can understand that the people who grew up with the original resident evil trilogy don’t like this game. I hear where you are coming from. It is far too different. But you have to see this game as it’s own thing. \n\nI say it is a must buy for anyone, with it only costing €20 you can’t go wrong.",Recommended
"The only good Biohazard game I've played so far.

Your dead? Good""  with inventory management asking yourself ""Should I use this now or later for the big mother f###er who eats bullets for dinner every night?"" speaking of which this is the best inventory I've ever used in any game allowing you to see what you can fit by moving around the things you've picked up so far. The horror is more on being in a corner with your back against the wall while the freaks who think their people speaking spanish (which last time I've check, spanish people don't go around with red glowing eyes with pitch forks with a virus eating people face off. Capcom) running at you with every moment that they have a chance to throw sh## at you.

The fact that it's Resident Evil 4 is enough to make it worth a recommendation, especially if you haven't played it before. It has aged exceedingly well, and influenced basically every 3rd person shooter of the last 14 years.\n\nThe advantage of this version over others however, is that an intrepid team of modders are in the process of completely updating the textures for the game, and they are nearly finished. In its current version, the ""Resident Evil 4 HD Project"" has added much higher quality textures for all of the areas, as well as for the weapon and item models. The only thing they have not upgraded yet is the character and enemy models, but this is the last thing they have to do.

I only ever feel safe when the safe house music plays\n+Combat is surprisingly fun despite being somewhat dated (especially if you've played REmake 2)\n+Inventory management is much like what you'd expect from Resident Evil titles. It's pretty fun to manage as usual!\n+The castle chapters give off the spooky yet silly vibes that remind me of the original Resident Evil \n+There is are interesting mechanics surrounding each weapon and the store dude lets you upgrade them for cash \n+The boss fights throughout are stupid fun, most of the time the monsters are easy to kill but it still feels like the fight is in your hands, which I feel later games in the series lost sight of. The game does feel like newer titels (re5, re6) with the action scenes/sequences but they're less annoying and quite frightening! \n+Throughout the chapters there are absolutely beautiful, immersive areas to explore that capture the same feeling on wonder I experienced in REmake 1 & 2, despite being more linear.\n+The game feels like the perfect mish-mash of Action RE games and Survival Horror RE games most of the time. It never goes too far over either edge\n\nCons-\n-By default the game has absolutely disgusting film grain. However, if you follow the instructions [url=https://pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Resident_Evil_4_Ultimate_HD_Edition#Film_Grain_Removal_Mod]here[/url] you can remove it for good\n-The implementation of 60FPS support seems is kinda awful because sometimes you can't pass QTEs depending on the situation\n-The sound is really bad.

Also you can't move and shoot. These are probably design choices which certainly make you more vulnerable, plus you do get used to them after a few hours.\n\nFinally, Leon is such a badass...",Recommended

This game features adaptive difficulty, so if you do well, the game get's harder and if you do bad, it get's easier. This was really cool for the time when it came out.\n\nI personally don't like this game because it's not a survival horror like previous games which overall drove the series to be more action oriented and less like what made it popular.

Playing the first few is definitely recommended but not required to enjoy this game (There's also a recap at the very beginning to give you an idea of whats going on in story).

"HELLO EVERYONE AFTER 3 years of no review ! :-D\nu must know that i often pick up a franchise and play all it's games in a row and review them all in a short time.\nso if u want a full review of evil franchises pls check my other reviews of EVIL games on steam in my profile.\ni reviewed RE 1-2-3-Code Veronica X under the game RE 1 HD on steam . i reviewed evil 0 HD on it's own page.\nall reviews are spoilers free so read worry free.\n------\nabout 3 years ago i played RE 1-2-3-Code Veronica, And RE 0 and reviewed them, then i played and finished RE4 which was next in line, but then i started playing some new released game (probably RsixSiege), and i never got to finish RE4 DLCs.\nSo now that RE 2 IS OUT AND AVAILABLE ON STEAM i got that RE feeling again and i went and finished the DLCs.\n-------\nSO HERE IS THE REVIEW :\ni dont know if everyone who want to review a game first check out other websites like gamespot and etc... or not but i usually do, but i dont care about them if they are not right !\ni dont know whats the deal with everyone going on about the game being so awesome and having so good cinematics and what not, the camera is actually one of the very few flaws in the game, heres why :\nif u r thinking yeah i got a MOUSE AND KEYBOARD , ,,,, DONT ! because the game take that away .\nu can rotate with mouse but as soon as u hit ASWD the camera RESETS and this doesnt feel normal, in reality u can walk a way and look the other way, but in this game u must always LOOK STRAIGHT FORWARD which is a flaw the game being somewhat nex gen and all.\nthe reason why people at the time loved the camera thing is THIS IS ONE OF THE FIRST FEW GAMES THAT WAS CALLED NEXT GEN IN ITS TIME ! ( games like SPLINTER CELL CHAOS THEORY - RE4 - PRINCE OF PERSIA and some other games where once what DEFINED THE INDUSTERIES NEW GRAPHICS forcing evryone to go from 64 mb vga to 128mb which was a LOT )\nok now that we have covered cam, next flaw in the game which is available in all platforms is that sometimes in the game u must push 2 buttons simontanously rapidly to stay alive, and believe me it wont work 9 out of 10 times due to stupid programming in all platforms, whether its TRIANGLE AND SQUARE in PS or RT + LT in X360 or mouse or keyboard buttons, u will lose and die a lot, and sometimes u must replay a 30 minute or so gameplay :@\nnow the story is good but not much complex due to the fact that most focus was on gameplay during production.\nthe DLCs follows ADA WANG's perspective but does not add much else to the story, the story is simple all round.\nall things considered the game is good and it was a success and it feels right after a while.\nbut a game with the flaw of the 2 button push in all platforms is a SERIOUS ISSUE in my opinion and therefore i cant give this game a 9/10 ! NO ! the game was a success at the time, sure it has some replay value too, but its not a 9 from 10 game, come on !\n\nI GIVE THIS GAME 8.9/10 !\nreviewed by IMMORTALEADER !",Recommended

"Have you ever ran to the toilet with only seconds to spare?  Resident evil 4 can only be described as that moment.  What I mean by that is, you’re just being chased by everyone all hours of the game.  Resident evil 4 is scary in a different way than the first few games are.  You play as Leon Kennedy (resident evil 2 character) who has to rescue the presidents daughter.  You were told that there are no zombies here, but zombies are the least of your worries.  There’s a parasite that has infected everyone in this European town, that controls them and makes them stronger.  Story wise this game is decent, it’s not so in your face with it.  Gameplay wise the shooting is a little weird, but after a while you grow to love this game.  Another thing I love about this game, the AI will get stronger the better you play (higher accuracy and less deaths).A lot of people say that this is one of the best games of all time, and I can see why.  I think this game was originally released in 2005, but it is still just fun.",Recommended

I understand back in 2005 this was a great game and up to par with other games out but playing this in 2019 is just a pain. It's like trying to play Super Mario Bros 3 today, the controls are so bad compared to today's norms that it will just be unplayable.

"Finally got arounded to buying RE4 and seeing if it lived up to all the hype and....it did (just beat it minutes ago). The story was pretty interesting all the way through and it had a nice scary atmosphere that made me shit my pants here and there. I also enjoyed the ambient atmosphere and level design alot, sometimes I would just stand around, listening and taking everything in for a while. The music without a doubt was one of my favorite parts too (The Save music at the type writers and the occasionally comfy music at the merchant). I enjoyed the gameplay, characters, story, and setting very much and I would recommend this game to anyone who likes the Resident Evil franchise. This game made me feel like I was in my own little world and I fell in love with it, it was very comfy just sitting back in my pc chair and kicking my feet up with my Ps4 controller and turning of the lights. I would suggest that whoever picks this up to do the same and you wont regret it. The game goes on sale for $5 often and even at full price ($20) its still worth. I also noticed little to no bugs during my playthrough at all. I'll stop rambling but this is a very good game despite its age and you should pick it up. Ill see ya around.",Recommended

If you haven't, do it here, just make sure you use a PS4/Xbone controller because keyboard and mouse will make you want to kill yourself. I've owned and beaten this gem on so many platforms it'd be easier to just list the ones I don't have a copy for either physically or digitally: Wii and GameCube. Boom, done. You'll hear some 1-3 fans tell you this game killed the franchise, and like to blame 4 for the switch to action oriented gameplay, but don't let that nostalgia glasses nonsense fool you.\n\nIt'll feel a little dated, sure, but this is the definitive Resident Evil game.  If you're only going to play one, play this one. It takes awhile to grow on you if you've never played it before, but trust me when I tell you it gets better the more time you give it. Fantastic game, no other Resident Evil game gives me the same warm fuzzy feeling that this one does. Buy it, just wait for a sale. They can kiss my ass with that $20 dollar price tag for a game that's older than some of you here. Oh, and remember; Controller. You'll thank me later.",Recommended

"Resident Evil 4 is, and will forever remain",Recommended
"Resident Evil 4 is a classic game and still fun to play to this day. This game knows how to use ambient sounds and music to keep you feeling uneasy. The story is also pretty entertaining, there are QTE's in this game but they're spaced out pretty evenly. This game has a variety of weapons to use, handguns, shotguns, magnums, snipers, and machine guns. The attache case system is interesting and you will be managing your inventory towards the start. The setting is great too, and gets better as you play. There are lots of collectables that are very useful, some might lead to you getting a free weapon, others you can sell for cash. You may want to hold on to some of them since you can upgrade certain collectables and sell them for a much higher price. If you are looking for an action/horror, this is the game for you.\n\nIf you are to pick Resident Evil 4 up I highly recommend the HD Project mod and two others improving the character and weapons. Perhaps by the time you read the review you will only have to download the HD Project but at the time of writing this review you will need all 3 for the best HD experience.\nI highly Recommend installing in this order.\n#1 HD Project - http://www.re4hd.com/\n#2 HD Character Mod - http://residentevilmodding.boards.net/thread/9340/repack-hd-characters\n#3 HD Weapons Mod - http://residentevilmodding.boards.net/thread/7025/ultimate-weapon-update-albert-release",Recommended

Still, the game is a classic and should be played by anyone who is already fan of the game series and it's already a great game to start if you aren't familiar to other RE entries, it doesn't contain much spoilers and isn't that scary compared to some earlier titles if you always been faint-hearted to try some of them.",Recommended

"I didn't play the original Resident Evil 4 back when it came out in 2005, mostly because I could barely talk at the time. So this is a purely objective review of RE4 with absolutely no nostalgia factor.\n\nIt is not a perfect game, because perfect games don't exist. But it does enough things right for almost anyone to overlook the tanky movement, slightly iffy controls and shitty dialogue delivered with such sincerety it comes around and sounds hilarious. Even though the franchise went full on over the top action with RE4 and onward, it's still a legendary horror game, and when you start to notice parallels with games like Dead Space and Alan Wake, you realise why RE4 was the industry leading behemoth back in the day.\n\nShooting feels surprisingly solid for a game from 14 years ago, it relies more on organic horror than cheap jumpscares, and the story is actually pretty good compared to the writhing mess that is Resident Evil canon.\nAlso, ""Normal"" difficulty will chop your fucking head off approximately nine times a minute so better sharpen up that aim and inventory management, or play on easy like a pleb.\n\n9/10 would recommend\n9.5/10 for midget Napoleon",Recommended

"Resident Evil 4 is a paradigm change from its first titles, both in gameplay and narrative. At first glance, anyone who was used to the previous games of the franchise may find it strange and even say ""this is no longer Resident Evil"". In my opinion, (and that's what a review means, personal opinion about something) Resident Evil 4 was successful in everything it set out to do. \nMuch more dynamic gameplay (innovating a lot in camera positioning), a fluidity that gives more action and speed to the game along with a narrative that moves away from what has already been exhaustively explored in the series, but without leaving its essence aside. The ""zombies"" continue (now shifting from an exclusively scientific approach to one with strong religious influence) in a dark and tense atmosphere shifting from suspense to terror in a natural way. But Resident Evil 4 is not limited to being excellent only in its main story. \nThe extras (after finishing the main game for the first time) please both players who enjoy action, frenetic gameplay and replay factor, and those who enjoy the story and the lore of the game. They are 3 minigames: The Mercenaries;Assignment Ada;Separate Ways. Resident Evil 4 is a unique production for fans of the series and for those who just want to play an excellent game (that works very well as a stand-alone game).",Recommended

I feel like this game is pretty good and does live up to the hype. The combat is fun and is built around the low FOV and maps you fight the enemies in. The main problem is that its way too long.

By that point it's gone on for way too long and the aesthetic of the island is not as interesting as the village/castle.\n\nOverall I will still reccomend it.,Recommended

Honestly I'd say it's a game that is worth your time, I already got my moneys worth and I have yet to completely finish the story, and on top of that even start the extra stuff you get after the story.",Recommended
"The controls on this game successfully destroy any possible enjoyment. I am using a controller, and it is X to shoot. Most game associate the trigger of the weapon with the trigger on the controller... Okay,I could probably re-map it, but it has other issues. You cannot move with a weapon drawn, whether gun or melee. I like to shoot, whilst edging backwards. In this game, you shoot, put your weapon away, turn around, walk a few steps, turn around again, and shoot again.\n\nTo help the experience, when you are walking you can use right stick to look around. When your weapon is drawn, left stick determines the direction you look.\n\nI did not meet anything more dangerous than a controlled local, but the real battle was with the controls. I am man enough to admit I lost that battle.",Not Recommended
"Review for new players:\nTank controls are the only thing you'll have to get used to if you want to play this game. The game does have issues (this port specifically) but since Capcom is ironing out issues one by one, no reason to doubt they'll fix your problem at some point but it is not optimised, if your PC runs RE6 fine, it'll probably still struggle here. But I'll take mouse controls over a controller anyday, plus thanks to the fact that its PC, controllers are no issue either.\nReview for just the port:\nNo FPS issues on my end, I do sometimes get water glitches especially in the part after the lake at night, cursor showing up in item pickup promts is annoying and sometimes causes my selection to stay on ""No"", I use the keyboard to select but it keeps going back to ""No"" since the cursor sometimes ends up there. I could go on but these are now becoming nitpicks.",Recommended

And i will probably play third time sooner or later. There's something special about this game. It's clunky, but you're gonna like it. It's fun, it's simple, yet complex enough to not be boring. Game starts slow, but once you'll get through the first few minutes, the stuff is gonna get fun, and it will keep you interested up until very end, when it's starts to be a little bit tedious in one location. All in all, a game worth to play, and also replay, just give it a try.",Recommended

"Holy hell after 19 long and hard years(hours) i finally finished the game. This is my first resident evil title and it was pretty good. i wanted it to end before the 2nd chapter because its was hard and very tedious and not very enjoyable. Now finishing the game i like that it wasn't a walk in the park although the first 80% of the game i would say is very tedious and not enjoyable. Only at the last 3 or so chapters would i say it was good although i was still dying for it to end. have to set the settings all low to be able to play oddly and the cutscenes still lagged once once i was half way thru but it wasn't a big deal to me. It's not replayable to me, maybe after i finish the other RE titles i bought.",Recommended

"Loving this game right now, just as good as it was on GameCube (with the addition of HD Textures and running at 60FPS)! At first it feels very clunky compared to most modern games, but once you surrender to the mechanics - you realize you're playing Gun Souls before Demon's Souls was actually a game.\n\nAlbiet you cannot just spam roll and avoid all attacks, it does have the heavy visceral combat with high penalty for mistakes. A lot of shock scares that kill the unprepared player for the first time, creative boss fights that require patience and awareness, and ever-evolving hordes of enemies throughout the playthru of this particular story.\n\nYeah RE4 was the one that decided to move on from Raccoon City and expand in a new direction with more environmental story telling that reinforces the lore behind the main narrative.\n\nTLDR; if you've never played the original, think Single-Player hybrid of Hunt: Showdown and Dark Souls... starring the guy from Resident Evil 2 as an American James Bond (I shit you not, that cheesy...)

I dont even like these types of games.  The controls are very hard to get used too.  The FOV is even harder to get used to.  But something keeps bringing me back.  There is a satisfying simplicity to re4....  I can't quite put my finger on it - but it's a very well crafted game - and its very fun.  Way more fun than most top titles in the store.  I highly recommend this game if you haven't tried it.,Recommended
I used to play this game a lot on the ps2.  I like this game a lot.  The story is well made.  It is challenging.  The weapons are cool and well balanced.  The bosses are varied.  The setting changes ever so often enough to keep it interesting but not enough to make you confused or anything.  This game is definetely the best in the franchise and possibly ever from the ps2 era.  I recommend this game to anyone who likes zombie stories.,Recommended
"Not the best Resident Evil game out of the franchise, that honor belongs to either Resident Evil 2 or the Resident Evil 1 Remake in my opinion. But, RE4 is without a doubt one of the best 3rd person action video games ever made. \n\nThis port is a bit wonky, I had to set my framerate to 30FPS otherwise the game was in constant slow down ala Max Payne bullet time. Don't recall that being an issue with the versions released on Xbox 1 and PS4. But I'd still recommend a purchase, especially at the sale price of $5 down from $20. \n\nThey rarely if ever make awesome single player games like this these days.\n\n\n\n",Recommended

"Being a late bloomer and working through a backlog of games i should have played long ago, but didn't, I finally got to RE4. \n\nOk, ok, so i still haven't gone through my backlog, but RE4 came on sale and for once i was sucked in completely. Couldn't stop playing it. This is a fantastic example of what someone could point to as a ""VIDEO GAME"", and is extremely refreshing in the face of ""cinematic"" video games that are being lauded as the second coming of christ or something (**coff** Last of Us **coff** Dad of War **coff**). While some things have not aged too well (namely being the popularizer of sudden death quick time events and button mashing, of which i'd be lying if i said i enjoyed them), the actual game is far more enjoyable than most games today and feel like a video game that's trying to be a video game for the same of, well, being a video game. There's no pretentions of being anything else or beyond. \n\nSurprisingly, despite popularizing and refining the refined ""over the shoulder"" element of third person shooters, no other game has managed to be as intrigingly context heavy and puzzle-esque in terms of game play. While this has been said about a billion times before, in better terms by many other people, RE4 is a game that prioritizes puzzle-like logic instead of a quick hand, though that helps a lot too. The tank controls are fantastic and very suitable for the genre, being restrictive enough to make a lot of the fights tense, but flexible and balanced enough to still be playable.\n\nAs mentioned with the whole ""being a video game"" thing, the story of the game is (at least to me) delberately cheesy, showing like some cheesy 80s action/horror film and is fairly sizable. Even the plot reeks of a cheesy film--You have to rescue the president's daughter and thwart a plot to destroy america, essentially by a bioweapon wielding cult in spain. Even the research into the setting of Spain is miniminal to outright wrong (just like any good b-movie that takes place in some exotic place). Gross out stuff, cheesy one-liners, and corny dialogue galore. It's all gold. Of course, it's not all cheese, there's a good bit of atmosphere and a good many enemies that will make your hair stand up, if only because many of them will insta-kill you if your not careful and create plenty of tension when dealing with them.\n\nI'm also pleased to discover that there's a good bit of extra stuff (including New Game plus) as well as the Ada modes (two mini-campaigns from what i understand), and the Mercenaries mode with extra characters (which I will play soon enough). All in all, this game has aged well and still remains a fantastic example of a video game (action, horror, or otherwise), and is great to unwind to. It's also a good reminder of what to strive for, something I feel has fallen by the wayside in the light of modern AAA releases and fad-chasing indie games. Very recommended.",Recommended
"I've played this both on STEAM/PC and PS4 Pro and the controls are funky.

"Don't get me wrong, the game in itself is pretty good. \nThe problem is the port of this game on steam, which contains so many bugs, that I felt like bethesda had sex with this game and transmitted a bug-illness on it ! \n\nFirst of, you need a decent PC and I mean by that a NASA PC, as this game is badly optimised even though it doesn't seem like it wouldn't be a problem to run it. \n\nYou will experience crashes unless you use a patch to fix it. \nThe game will also run in a weird slow-motion way, if you don't have a decent PC (I'm guessing that the problem is solved when you run it on a PC with a good processor, yeah processor not graphics-card) so you have to fix this problem since it's (obviously) unplayable in slow-motion.\n\nFurthermore, I don't know if it is because of the patch or the steam port, but the game wil freeze sometimes, for example if you want to change guns in your inventory, there is a possibility that the game will freeze/not respond and the only thing you can do is to close and restart it (so you have to save very often, if you don't want to risk losing your progress).\n\nYou will also have some random framedrops if you don't fix this issue in the game files. \nThe music will also be bugged. When your fps drops, the music will also start to skip a few notes every time (you hear the music for a few seconds and it will be silent then it will go on again, etc.) and this totally destroys the immersion of the game which is a shame since the game has an awesome soundtrack.\n\nI played this game completely on steam because I couldn't play it on an emulator. My advice is, play it on your PS2 or on an emulator, if you can, this will save you some hours that you would spend fixing those bugs in this game.\nIf you don't have a monster PC that can run the witcher 3 on ultra, I would think twice before buying this game on steam. No joke !",Not Recommended
"Many know the Resident Evil series for its balance of survival horror elements and over-the-top action. While it is widely argued that Resident Evil 4 started the trend of the series' stray towards a 'lighter' action adventure convention, I think that the game still retains the gritty atmosphere of the previous instalments while embracing its fun, campy nature. As well as accomplishing this through the excessive cinematics RE4 features (E.G. QTE cutscenes), many of its mechanics have been revamped to suit the new direction of the game. As a result, Capcom successfully introduced a freeing yet restrictive third person perspective which requires quick reflexes and fast-paced gunplay that was unheard of in any of the prequels. Although this may have been a massive risk to take for an already-established franchise, RE4's overhaul ultimately paid off as it revitalised interest in the series through its effective audiovisual presentation and distinct combat.",Recommended

"This game is the finest one, I'm telling. HOWEVER, not the remastered ""hd"" one. I both recommend (because of the game itself, it is a Recommended masterpiece indeed) and reject it, and I'll explain why. Perhaps this situation occures only on my PC, perhaps not. Anyway, the remastering is really raw and bugged, hence sometimes it just crashes or freezes in the middle of a combat, yet 90% of freezes happen after a short briefing with Hannigan or after changing a weapon in inventory menu. Besides, the thing which dissapoints me the most, is invisibility of certain buttons in some certain ""press X to win"" scenes such as running from a stone or crouching from swings of this giant thing (whom with the wolf you rescued from a floor trap in the very beginning of the game helps you defeat). Or, as well, running from a big mechanical statue of Ramon Salazar. Yes, I aware it can be buttons such as X and C on a keyboard or LMB and RMB on a mouse respectively, but in that moments all I see is two semi-opaque red squares with nothing on them.

"[u]What I liked: [/u]\n[list]\n    [*]The movement and shooting mechanics\n    [*]Inventory choices must be made\n    [*] Power progression is nice\n[/list]\n\n[u]What I didn’t like: [/u]\n[list]\n    [*] Mouse and keyboards controls\n    [*]QTE’s\n    [*]Ashley’s voice and escorting her (kind of)\n\n[/list]\n\n[u]More in depth: [/u]\n[list]\n    [*]I’ve only played resident evil 5 co-op before this and found out about the series from the movies. Yep you heard that right. Heard this one was good and wanted to give it a shot. Here we go.\n\n    [*]As playing #5 the not moving and shooting with a very close up camera didn’t affect me. The slow movement of both you and the enemy do make the game unique and I love that this style of gameplay. It does make what would be tense fights, kind of lackluster as you can easily dodge by just walking, as the game is slowed to make this style of control viable. \n\n    [*]You have a story that I don’t remember just like the movies. It pushes you forward and having boring villains and being told through notes left around the levels makes it a chore to listen to. Luckily you can skip them. Just don’t expect the story to carry you through the game.\n\n    [*]So why do so many people love this game. Like always the gameplay is both unique and so much fun. You start off with just a basic pistol that sucks, low ammo and a knife that you use to conserve ammo. You can’t move and shoot, you have a laser to see where to aim and your enemies move slowly or stay back and either shoot or throw stuff at you. You can shoot them out midair, kind of dope. You get more weapons that you can upgrade to become GOD tier with money that you collect.\n\n    [*]The game gives you so many drops and secrets that you’ll tell them to slow down. You have treasures that you collect and sell, but if you save some and combine them with others you get more money in the long term. You upgrade your health as well.  This encourages you to allow explore to get more money to get more powerful. \n\n    [*]You also have to keep your inventory in check by both buying larger cases to hold more and keeping only what you really need. I was able at the end have 4 weapons with 2 reloads each, plenty of heals and an RPG. So you can carry a lot when upgraded.\n\n    [*]With all the great out of the way, let me say what sucks in this game. First pc controls are annoying, first no rebinding, moving items has you use dumb key binds to get stuff to work, like rotate item with the delete key?! And move with backspace? Going through menus and texts is finicky if you think you can use the mouse to select the answer, but it doesn’t select it even when it shows you hover over it. Next you have dumb QTE’s that are half award to use like both “X” & “C” along with you having to literally hit it faster than you think you need to or failing it. Like you need to smash that thing like 20 times per second or you fail. They are also just dumb to be in the game, like spring by smashing that button. Add a dodge instead of it being a QTE.\n\n      [*] You have very little music in the game so you get a lot of silence, but that was ok, what wasn’t was having so sound options, so when you do get music, it’s insanely loud, so you turn the whole game down. You have the annoying Ashely you need to rescue (who is always yelling at me to help her) and the escorting wasn’t as bad as I thought it was going to be as it fit what you the game was about in terms of story. I just never healed her and let her die instead of using my precious healing on her.\n\n    [*]You have some interesting, but unpolished boss fights that can be easily beaten if you bring an RPG. Those things are a one shot killer, but expensive. You also have puzzles that I didn’t expect some of them to give an actual challenge. \n\n      [*] Overall the game is great and worth playing but has many issues that are should not be in the game. A lot of easy fixes that make an excellent game annoying at times. There is no other game like it when looking for similar games. The only one is Dead Space and I am now looking forward to playing RE7 and the new RE2 remake coming out in 2019.\n\n [/list]\n\n[h1]My Score: [/h1]\n[b]B[/b]\n\n[b]Paid: $5[/b]\n[b]Completed in: 15 hours[/b]\n\nGames similar I recommend: \n[list]\n    [*]Total Chaos (DOOM 2 mod)\n    [*] Resident Evil 5 (played on console)\n    [*] [url=https://store.steampowered.com/recommended/recommendgame/47780]Dead Space 1 & 2[/url]\n    [*] Dead Rising 2 (played on console)\n    [*]Looking to try next: Evil within 2, and RE7\n\n [/list]	\n",Recommended

"Ok, this game fucking rules. \nGameplay: The gameplay can be tough and challenging some moments, but it is highly rewarding and satisfying. The level design is very well though out. The adaptive difficulty is really cool too (If you play bad it will be easier, if you play good it will be harder). Spme of the moments in this game can be absolutely terrifying, from the downright creepy atmosphere in some areas or the moment where you see the first regenerator. The controls in this game make it an even better survival horror experience. It makes it tougher for you to move fast, so you will be cornered with tough decisions on what gun to use or if you should use your medkit or save it for later.\nStory: The story in this game is good, but it's not really outstanding. The characters in this game are really memorable and it is a very shining moment for the character Leon in the Resident Evil franchise. The plot twist is obvious (the same one every game), but it's really about the characters in this game and your goal.\n\nOverall, if this game is on sale definitely buy it.

"Great game, I've always loved the Resident Evil series, and I was skeptical when I began this one but trust me, it's worth it. The gameplay is great, the cutscenes are immersive, and the story is so well made. This game literally keeps you on the edge of your seat, whether it be by fighting off countless enemies, fighting a huge boss, or even watching a cutscene you'll have to react to.

As always RE4 is excellent. The updated graphics and whatnot are nice too. My only complaint would be having to complete the game on Easy before unlocking Normal and then having to clear Normal to play Professional instead of just allowing people to jump straight into Professional. But this does allow for some messing around with guns that you would never buy such as the Mine Thrower. \n\n10/10 Would recommend.,Recommended
"I've 100% this game on Wii & PS2. As you can guess this is one of my favorite games. But this PC port is simply horrible.. Poorly optimized for windows. And as far as ""HD goes, its only the title. There are no improvements. The controls are messed up. And even if you are willing to look past all that, the game is down right unplayable on decent gaming systems. My pc runs GTA 5 fine on high settings but somehow struggles to squeeeze out 15fps on this game. Couldn't even get past the first village. It is THAT horrible. Worst part is after all this time, I dont think they'll make any improvements. Play this masterpiece on a console. Thats the best you could do. I wouldn't even recommend buying it during sale. I did and I had to pul it up for refund.",Not Recommended
"I haden't played it since it originally came out and is probably the RE I've played the least. So it was nice to run through it again. Also, I never played ""Seperate Ways"" DLC so that was good to play something new.\n\nLevel designs and enemies are still really good. The game is overall fun to play. However, as you may have read from other reviews you pretty much need a controller to play it properly as RE4 has the worst controls out of any of the main RE Games (that gun one on the wii was probably worse for me) It's a hybrid of the old Resident evil tank controls combined with the over the shoulder camera that doesn't really work well for keyboard and mouse.  When 5 came out the controls improved (probably the best contorls out of the Over the Shoulder games) So for me, RE4 will age the worst in the entire series. It may be unplayable if you don't have a contorller.\n\nAshley is also still as annoying as I remember which sours the overall experience. Luckly, large chunks of the game don't feature her in it.\n\nOverall, It was a worth the run through again at $8. Can't wait for Remake 2.",Recommended

"Resident evil 4 is game in which there isn't a whole lot to say that hasn't already been said, if you're looking into reviews because you truly don't know alot about this game then i can truly say that i recommend this game without a doubt and it's definitely one of the best games i've ever played. I played this on Gamecube, PS2 and now on PC.\n\nThe story is about Leon Scott Kennedy as he is tasked with rescuing the presidents daughter from a spanish cult, and as you embark on this rescue mission you notice that there is alot more going on than you initially are lead to believe. Overall the story is kind of cheesy, but it works in this game and is more ""funny"" than ""serious"" i would say.\n\nThis game changed the Resident Evil games forever with the change to a third person perspective and definitely drew the games to be more action focused rather than being horror games, which for some people ruined the Resident Evil series. For me personally though i don't like to think too much about which ""category"" to put the game in, i like to just play the game for what it is and that's one of the reasons why i really enjoy this game.\n\nThis game originally came out in 2005 for the Gamecube, and you can definitely tell even with this PC version of it. It looks dated which might turn some people off of the game, but since i already have ""ties"" to this game i don't mind the graphics and still think it looks good.\n\nStory: 6,5/10\nGameplay: 8/10\nGraphics: 8/10\nTotal experience: 8/10\n\nFor people who either played the older versions or are interested in playing this game they definitely should play this, in my opinion it deserves alot(not all of) the praise it gets, it was an important game for it's time.",Recommended

One minute the game is a over the top 80's action movie, the next a frightening horror movie with some of the scariest enemies in any game (Regenerators). One word of advice, SET THE FRAME RATE TO 30 FPS. Some of the QTE's are virtually impossible at a 60 fps lock. Otherwise the few hiccups due to porting, this game is a timeless masterpiece.",Recommended

Nothing new to see here apart from a 60fps option if you're p.c can handle that then most NOT ALL of the game runs 60fps. Certain animations like weapon reloading is not 60fps lol ALL the the textures are STILL a blurry mess from the past with extremely little changes here & there. Very disappointing for fans of a great game. \n\ncapcom refuses to improve this game but lies about it & sticks a H.D label on a mostly unchanged game.

"[h1]resident evil 4 / biohazard 4[/h1]\n\n[b][u]This game is one of the funnest game I ever play on PS2[/u][/b]\n[b]Q[/b]: [i]Eh? What does this have to do with this version of PC port?[/i] \n[b]A[/b]: [u]Well nothing really but, my PS2 broke down that I can no longer play it on PS2 so there's that..[/u] \nAnd I believe that normally a person that checks out this game is also play the game before in the older console as well.\nAnd of course, if you're new to this game.. It's a zombie slaying game, what's more fun than zombie slaying game? (Well I guess there's a tons of things that more fun than zombie slaying game in general but I digress)\n\nBut enought about my nostalgia, let's talk about this game yeah?\n[b]Gameplay[/b] \nIn this version of PC port, you can control your game not just with keyboard but with mouse as well, but yes of course you also able to control things with gaming controller (preferably the xbox 360 controller).\nYou can now aim and shoot your weapon with your mouse unlike the other PC version.. personally, it feel a bit weird at first but I'm sure you can get used to it. \nIt still got glitches from the old console (e.g. DitMan glitch, and The Jetski glitch) so I guess you can have fun with that. \nThe key binding is changeable.\n*On Personal note, I find it a bit hard to do the QTE with keyboard in higher difficulty, so watch out for that if you're using keyboard.\n\n[b]Graphics..[/b] \nThe graphics got a bit improvement from the old console version, not a mind blowing difference kinds of improvement but still improvement nonetheless, so set your standard low for this thing.\n[u]It now support 60fps[/u], which is greatly appreciated. [i]But, the 60fps is also kinda has its own problem[/i], if by any chance your machine can't handle it, the frame rate will of course drop and cause a rather baffling slow motion effect.. which I personally didn't enjoy.\n[u]You can play with 30fps[/u], well this is personally just in the case you encounter the problem mentioned above, and you know.. personal preference. \n[u][i]The Cutscene for the main story[/i] is now rendered in HD[/u], and you can now see your Normal and Special 1 costume in it. [b][i]But[/i][/b], [i]the other cutscene for the Separate Ways story is another thing.. it's still use.. I guess videos from the old version of the console game, which if you see it in either HD or Full HD.. will looks like you just run a 144p video on YouTube (Which is bad).[/i]\nSo all in all, do check the system requirement for this game before purcashing.\n\n\n\nOverall, even though technically speaking this is an old game, it's still a lot of fun. \nI recommend this game to anyone, be it new player or old player that play the game before.\nI gave it a [b]9/10[/b]",Recommended
"Great game, but Capcom has awful customer service.\n\nI was really excited to play this game on PC, so I wound up getting it. On startup, the game's audio would play but it would give me a black screen. I fiddled around using Compatibility Mode, capping my FPS, and still nothing. I tried everything and even searched online, but still to no avail.\n\nI went to fill out a ticket to Steam Support (whom has been very helpful in the past in these issues) only to find out that Steam Support does not respond to issues on this game and that I would have to go through Capcom to find my desired fix.\n\nSo, I sent Capcom a ticket stating my problem. 6 hours after I sent the ticket, still no response. I figured, ""Ok, I'll give them a day."" A day passed by. Still no response. 3 Days passed by. No response. A week passed by, no response. A month went by.... guess what? No response. I am usually a pretty patient guy when it comes to these sorts of things, but there is NO excuse for someone to wait over a month to get a response to a support ticket.\n\nUnless if you want to have a chance to deal with the same issues I've had, then I'd recommend staying away.",Not Recommended

"I tried playing this game with a Logitech Dual Action controller, and it was unplayable. After readying the knife, aiming would be restricted for almost a full second. I was able to eliminate this issue by mapping the controller to Xbox 360 controls using x360ce. It was dissapointing that the game really does not work without doing this, but the fix was quick. I would not recommend using mouse and keyboard for this game. It works, but I think this game was designed for controller; the aiming and movement mechanics just don't work nicely on a mouse/keyboard -- I don't think it is a bad porting issue. The key point is that you cannot strafe in this game, so if you are hoping to use M/K, ask yourself what you want the A and D keys to do. I didn't notice any out of sync dialogue in the cinematics; but I've only played for 1 hour.\n\nFor people hoping to relive their childhood in HD 60 fps, I recommend getting this game on sale.\n\nPros:\n- HD and 60 FPS.\n- The game is a masterpiece.\nCons:\n- Bad controller support -- map to Xbox 360 using x360ce or might not be playable. Can't customize controls very much.\n- 60 FPS cap\n- Not desgined for mouse and keyboard. Don't buy if you are expecting modern first-person shooter mechanics for M/K.",Recommended

Now that Im replaying the game, Because the games difficulty is actually based on your performance, I have to use melee combos otherwise I will run out of bullets. I performed too good and Im being punished for it. AND THATS AMAZING.\nThis game forces you to play smart and be on your toes constantly. Shitting yourself unstoppably and it has aged well. Infact it has aged so well that I cannot stop playing it, Exact same as me 10 years ago.\nTLDR:\n> Game mechanics are meh but once you get used to them you can abuse the shit outta them.\n> Graphics are updated and look good enough\n> SCARY AF, Even more scary if you are new to the game.\n> Difficulty is based on your performance. The better u do the harder the game gets. Keeps you thinking and makes you play smart or keep playing dumb if you swing that way.\n> The Fights are VERY Layered, Forces you to read documents and experiment with certain enemies and enviroments to find ways to kill them fast.\n> Story is hilarous at times but all around great.\n> Game is long as heck. an alternate story thats going on plus the actual game with alot of merceneries and random modes.\n\nBasically, The game is still a legend.

"Scary, intense, action-packed, and most importantly, fun. Resident Evil 4 is a triumph in nearly every aspect. You are Leon Kennedy, sent to a decrepit village to locate the U.S. President's missing daughter. Upon arriving, you immediately notice that something is off about the villagers, and it doesn't take long for the nightmare to begin from there. \n\nResident Evil 4 isn't as scary as previous entries like RE1; as you get more and more weapons the enemies you face are easier to dispose of, and the last portion of the game feels more like an action movie than survival horror. That's not to say that the game doesn't have its fair share of terrifying moments, though. One particular moment where you are waiting for an elevator and are being pursued by a seemingly invincible enemy is a standout. What the game does excel at is putting the player in situations that stress you out, whether its being chased by a villager with a chainsaw or being set on by an angry mob of cultists. \n\nAt first, I was bothered by the aiming mechanic; Leon can't move and shoot at the same time. After a while though, it became apparent that this was a deliberate mechanic that forces the player to aim and shoot intelligently (much like Dead Space) and position themselves in spots that would give them an advantage over their adversary. Nothing is more satisfying than shooting an enemy in the leg to stumble it, then finishing it off with a suplex melee combo. \n\nThis being a RE game, the enemies are varied and boss fights aplenty. Each enemy of course has a weakness that you need to exploit to kill it - finding out what this weakness is and capitalizing on it was part of what made each encounter so fun. Also, the environments and levels you will be going through are innovative and fresh, even if they don't really make any logical sense. \n\nThe story is probably the weakest element, as it falls into typical B-movie territory every so often. But the game knows this, and the characters are likeable (yes, even with Ashley's annoying ""LEOOONN! HELPPP!""), so it didn't bother me all that much. Leon is somewhat of a typical action hero lead, but his goofy nature (he has the best bad one-liners, if that makes any sense) make him much more grounded. If anything it's an entertaining action horror thrill-ride; it doesn't try to be anything else (and the story is told much better than RE1). The cutscenes are also of a high production value and deserves a mention. \n\nOnce you finish the main story, a whole bunch of unlockables are there for you to go through. In particular, Separate Ways is an outstanding campaign that features Ada Wong and runs parallel to the main story. For an unlockable level, there's an incredible amount of detail and really explains some of the more confusing story elements of the main campaign (like, why is Ada always there as a Deus Ex Machina?). Replay value is immense. \n\nI really can't think of any negatives...if I'm reaching I can say that the camera controls are a little bit awkward using mouse and keyboard, but I got used to it after a while. \n\nDefinitely play this with the RE4 PC HD mod. It's already a great looking game without the mod but using it adds some HD textures and lighting improvements, if that's your thing.\n\nHighly recommended. \n\n\n",Recommended

In my opinion this is the freshest breath brought to the Resident Evil Franchise since Resident Evil 2 and the only game that comes close is Resident Evil 7. With all the Zombie games out there now I enjoy when a game can break the cycle of just being a Zombie game.,Recommended

"Not much to say about this game that people don't already know. \n\nThis is one of the best games ever made. The replayability of this is ridiculous. I've beaten this game countless times on all systems since its release back in 2005. I've even beaten it multiple times in one sitting. Play it, beat it, start again.\n\nWhat makes this game so replayable is you can challenge yourself in numerous ways from using only a certain gun the whole game, or trying to get through without taking a single hit.\n\nThis is also a great game to speedrun and the speedrunning community still runs this trying to improve times or find new strats. So if you enjoy speedrunning this is a fantastic game for it.\n\nNot much more to say on a 13 year old game. Everyone should already know about it...",Recommended

"Resident Evil games are often a combination of skill, resource management, frustrating puzzles, jump scares, blind spots and some trial and error. This game is no exception, but the ""Alone in the Dark"" inspired awkward camera angles have been replaced with an over the shoulder third person perspective. Feels good man and refreshing to see Capcom temporarily ceased to stop beating that rotting horse carcass to try something a touch different.\n\nYou are Leon an ex-cop / soldier of fortune / backstreet boy looking for the president's kidnapped daughter. Leon then quickly stumbles upon the psychotic populace of Jonestown. Unfortunately for him, after years of intense combat training, Leon has forgotten how to strafe or side step. The story feels somewhere between a brutal horror anime series and RE's very own campily acted predecessors.\n\nYou'll either be quietly exploring, avoiding some tricks and traps or mercilessly massacre the entire population of Spain. Resident Evil fans will be happy to hear they've shovelled in piles of steaming resident evil lore into this game with a few familiar characters.\n\nI've bought this game on PS2, Wii and two different versions on PC. This version has HD textures and allows you to use your mouse to aim and pop heads. I reckon the Wii version is still far superior, but it's good to play and finish RE4 without feeling like you've been w@nking for the past 15 hours.\n\nThere's a farkload of extras to unlock within the core game which feels nice as I was expecting I'd have to open my wallet again at some point. Luckily I don't give a sh!t about playing dressups otherwise I could easily spend a couple of more bucks.\n\nSome merciless Quick Time Events and overpowered monsters may quickly make Leon a disfigured entity of his former self which may irritate the fark out of people. There's a learning curve here as well as a bit of anticipation for certain sections but it's achievable.\n\nThis was hailed as the best RE game at the time and for a good reason. If you haven't already bought it you will...",Recommended

"If you like anything about Resident Evil you need to get this game. This is one of the best games I've ever played. I couldn't beat it as a child on my Gamecube, but here we are years later, with me picking it back up and finally finishing what I started.\n\nIt's not particularly scary even though you can get spooked by some around the corner things or getting hit from behind out of seemingly nowhere. So don't expect that Survival Horror tag to be the main attraction of this game.\n\nThe biggest obstacle of this game is the fact you have to stand still while you aim or use your melee, which does make this game a tad bit harder than most 3rd Person Shooters. You also won't be able to just carry around 5 guns and swap between them as needed since your inventory is grid based and you'll have to arrange it to actually fit things in.\n\nThe puzzles are also super nice and fit nicely into the game. The graphics are stupid good for such an old game as well. I remember being fascinated with Leon's hair graphics back in the day on my Gamecube. \n\nThis game is easily worth $20 and will give you at least one good, fun playthrough of a story. Do yourself a favor and pick this game up. I cannot stress enough how fun and entertaining this game is.",Recommended

"A quick guide to dynamite mechanics in Resident Evil 4:\nBy default, dynamite fuses last forever. If you see an enemy holding dynamite, he will be holding it indefinitely unless you either: shoot the dynamite, kill the enemy, or he throws it at you. The moment you kill an enemy with dynamite, the fuse suddenly becomes a 1 second fuse. Watch out. You can shoot dynamite out of an enemy's hand but the hitbox is rather small and dificult to hit; however, once the dynamite has been thrown the hitbox is far less strict. This is the ideal time to shoot it. Knowing these facts can save your life and more importantly save you ammo.",Recommended
This is easily one of the greatest games ever made. Years and years later I'm still enjoying the shit out of it. A classic. Don't spend 20 bucks on fast food when you could get so much enjoyment from an amazing action/survival game like this. A few bugs aside the port is excellent.,Recommended

"I have yet to complete this game on PC as I just bought it as of writing this review, but I must say that Resident Evil 4 has to be one of the best RE games in its' series. Starting it up and watching the intro along with being introduced to the Las Plagas and the chainsaw dude brought back some legit childhood memories. We're talking coming home from piles of homework, getting picked on at school to hearing that old school PS2 start-up and playing this awesome game at 11:00 P.M at low volume on your TV childhood memories.\nThis game I've beaten 7 different times on Ps2. Unlocking (SPOILERS to those who haven't beaten it but fuck it, you should've) the Mafia clothes, infinite ammo tommy gun and the infinite rocket launcher. After I got that, the Regenerators didn't scare me at all and the game was just even more fun to mess around in and beat for the 4th time over. This game ROCKS!!!\n\nThough, the port does have 1 major flaw: Controls.\nThe way you move around is very awkward and clunky. I was hoping I'd be able to walk/run around and turn with my mouse. NOPE! I have to turn using A & D and quick turn using only Q which makes sense, but why not also have it as E? And where's my knife? I expected it to be F or V or Middle Mouse. I have yet to find that stupid knife.\n\nMy suggestion on how to fix this is to make it so the controls are KEYBOARD & MOUSE friendly! Let us be able to navigate with our mouse, don't force us to do this awkward look around with the mouse and turn with the keyboard (Note: If you look around with your mouse and attempt to turn and run, it'll completely disorientate and fuck you over. Don't even move your mouse)\nWith this issue in mind, I don't know how I'll be able to beat some of the things you encounter like Regenerators when you first meet them. They're in a very CQC environment; long narrow hallways, the room you first meet one in, the spiked regenerator in the sewer area. Or even bosses that require lots of movement such as Krauser and Saddler. I'll deal with it when I get there, but I already know I won't have a good time.\n\nOther than that flaw, game is still as amazing as it was left off in the PS2-era. If you can somehow get over the controls being awkward and clunky, this game is for you.",Recommended
"Recommendedly one of the greatest games of all time.  It still holds up after over a decade.\n\nThe genre itself isn't for everyone, but if you love action with a side of horror this game is for you.",Recommended

"Resident Evil 4 is a mechanically sound masterpiece with a flawed third-act. The grandfather of the 3rd-person shooter genre remains as an outstanding experience filled with desirable content, despite its age and aging visuals. I recommend Resident Evil 4.\n\nPros:\n• Solid Controls.\n• Great Gunplay.\n• Great Level Design.\n• Creative Cast of Characters.\n• Great Pseudo-Metroidvania Aspects.\n• Clever Implementation of Inventory Management.\n• Large Amount of Unlockable Content and Modes (including a 2nd Campaign, New Game+, and the video-game industry's best horde mode: Mercenaries).\n\nCons:\n• One-hit kills from traps, enemies, and attacks is inherently terrible game design. RE4 has some of these, which is a stain on its overall high quality.\n• Some of the side-characters in RE4 are borderline Loony Toons goofy; going beyond the acceptable campiness that comes w/the Resident Evil franchise.\n• Pre-rendered cutscenes are locked to their original resolution and framerate, which is lower than 720p/60fps. These cutscenes look terrible and are a blurry mess.\n• The third act of RE4's main campaign devolves the game into a pre-Gears of War military shooter, giving the player a lot of resources and a lot of inventory space to kill swarms of military personal. The third act feels out of place and doesn't hold the same level of prestige game design as the first two acts.",Recommended

"An absolute gem of my childhood years, a game I wanted to play ever since I saw the 2003 E3 trailer, I was fortunate enough to first play this on a PS2. The gameplay is still as rich as ever, the challenge is just as good and the story and characters I can finally see as the campy masterpiece they truly are. \n\nThe ""HD"" isn't all that it might be, but there's mods for that which do a fine job bringing the game up to scratch.\nIt's the classic that defined 3rd Person shooters for most 21st Century gaming experiences. It's a fine survival horror game that has aged well. I'll happily finish this game for the 20th+ time, because it's just that great a journey.\n\nCheers Capcom.",Recommended

There are not enough great things i can say about this game or this port. Ive put so many hours on the gamecube version when it first released beating the game over 50 times as a kid. I bought this port do to the graphical upgrade and i was not let down at all.,Recommended
"It's quite a good game, but don't use to many money on it. ;) The story is great, and graphics okay, but a bit old, and could do with an update (available for download).\nBut the cut-scenes are rather stupid. Yes, they drive the story, but the things they say is so stupid. I think my girlfriend could make a better script...\nThe handling/control is also a bit weird. Also not very logic... oh, he can climp here but not this small box next to it. A bit annoying, but you'll get the hang of it eventually and can enjoy the story.\n\nSo if you like stories for your zombie-ish shootting, buy this game (at a discount!)\nOr find something better...\nI got hooked on the game, but it's actually not very good. ;)",Not Recommended

"Surprised I haven't written a review yet for this gem of a game. Perfect mix of action and survival horror, with a good story, good game mechanics, and charming, memorable environments.\n\nTL;DR When pretty much 99.9% of people that have played this game in the past have loved it, you should probably take it as a hint that it's a really good game that you should at least look into a little more.\n\nMy first rated M game I ever got when I started playing games back when I was 8 or 9 years old. I'm 20 years old now, and have easily beat this game over 100 times. Ranks as one of my most favorite games of all time and introduced me to the Resident Evil series. I've played most of the games in this franchise, and despite what some super, radical, hardcore fans might say, this is one of the best games in the series, and in my honest opinion, when a game (a single player game at that!) that's 18 years old gets ported to just about every console ever, is critically acclaimed, and gets you to beat it more than 100 times from how fun it is, I consider it to be one of the best games ever made in the history of video games, hands down.",Recommended
"I do remember when I was a kid and I had a Fat PlayStation 2 and a Slim.

In Resident Evil 1, 2, 3 . We had zombies and it were happen the zombie infection in Raccoon City. Of Course we will understand why we don't have zombies anymore (play the game and you will know it) But still it's a bit weird, but I still like it, Especially the village's speaks Spanish, like VAMONOS,  (C'mon) Mátalo (Kill Him)  Illevarlo (Take him) and else. :) I only one thing I kinda not really like , Theere's a group they made  HD Edition of this game, we know Capcom made, it already but, with that HD Edition let's call a Mod. It has better Graphics, Textures, and SkyBox as well, I do respect Capcom for a remake- But if they do a remake please don't let the near by textures a bit (blurry) with the HD mod it's like... I 'm playing on a 4K resolution or something. Actually I do play on 4K with 60fps.\n\nBut no hard feelings, I really do like it and I do respect Capcom made a remake of this game.

One of the best resident evil games out there!\n\n9/10,Recommended
"A great classic with some dated elements... \n\nThe Good : The level design, shooting are great, and exploration is rewarded. Enemy variety isn't much, but whatever is on showcase does the job very well. Interesting and memorable boss fights. \n\nThe Bad : Tank controls. The story and writing are dated for 2018.\n\nThe Ugly : The graphics... And an inventory system that you have to keep opening each time you want to even switch a weapon. Something I found tedious at first, but it isn't really all that bad. There is some good in the inventory system too, like mixing different herbs to regain / increase health permanently - something you will figure out when you play. \n\nI realize that I've stated more bad things than good, but the fact of the matter is the Good far outweighs the Bad and the Ugly. I tried this game years ago, and ended up deleting after the first level because I hated the tank controls and the graphics. After all these years, I decided to give this game another shot, because there are a lot of praises being sung about this game so I decided to re install it. And boy am I glad I did, because this game is something which belonged to the Golden Age of Gaming, and this is one of the games that defined it. There are some elements in the game which might be considered 'hardcore' for the casual audience, and that's why we don't get games like this anymore. Note that 'hardcore' doesn't really mean hard, but just that some elements aren't too streamlined like we have in games today. I wish I had played this a decade ago, but I'm glad that I did eventually. A must play for any real gamer - new or old.",Recommended

"It's Resident Evil 4 what more do you want? It has meticulous attention to detail in all the various things you can do and ways you can manage each individual playthrough, which leads fantastic replay value. And it's just bursting at the seams with content and quality. The only thing I will say is that Resident Evil 4 has some issues when it comes down to which is the optimal version to play, and the PC version is no exception. It has issues running on some PCs, and when booting it up for the first I would recommend going into video settings and turning the frame rate down from 60 FPS to 30 FPS. You can only do so from the main menu and not the pause menu, and I had some issues with it running slow at 60 frames. \nAnother thing, this game was not made with a keyboard and mouse in mind and while you can play it with those, I would recommend grabbing a gamepad for this one. The aiming especially was intended for a joy stick and not a mouse. And one final caveat, the default control scheme for gamepads maps aiming to the right trigger, and shooting to a face button. So you may want to look into alternating the control scheme to be a tad more modern. \n\nGood luck and have fun.",Recommended

The gunplay is still solid 14 years later, and cinematography holds up well also.\n\nI didn't experience any glitches or technical issues in my playthrough, although I'd recommend using M&K as controller is finnicky and irresponsive at times. Comparatively, it's a level above it's latter release RE5, and if you're into the Dead Space games this is basically the inspirational foundation Visceral used to create that series.\n\n+1, thanks Japan.",Recommended

"don't get me wrong, resident evil 4 is still one of my favorite games of all time.\n\nbut this port is terrible. unless i play at 30 fps, i get random framerate drops and a sluggish feel to the character. i tried all the solutions - 4gb patch, turning off v-sync, turning off anisotropic and anti-aliasing, and trying out different mods. i just couldn't get smooth performance on my gtx1070 w/ 16gb ram on ryzen 5.\n\ni ended up just running through the game on an emulator to get better performance at 60 fps.\n\nEDIT: i was able to get smooth 60fps performance, here's how:\n- re4hd textures mod\n- 4gb patch mod (found on re4hd textures website)\n- open config.ini, set \n      * v-sync to 0\n      * framerate to 0\n      * anisotropic to 0\n      * anti-aliasing to 0 or 2\n      * windowed mode\n- save config.ini and set to read-only (your game will crash if you open video settings in re4 now)\n- turn on v-sync in your gpu control panel\n\ni had an odd crash here and there afterwards, so save often. but the performance was significantly better. i'm keeping my ""not recommended"" since this took me ~6 hrs of troubleshooting and reading forums to figure out.",Not Recommended

"Right I felt I had to write my own review because I'm sick and tired of the bad rep this game gets when in reality it's a good game, nostalgic tank camera angle, RE Nerd opinions aside... This is game at the time was capcoms response to a stale and repetitive appraoch to the series, people weren't liking RE3 it was too much like 2, and it was too much like 1... So they experiemented and released Resident Evil: Dead Aim (which was meh) which introduced the first over the shoulder camera angle ever seen. They then released Resident Evil 4, which immediately revolutionised the gaming industry with its new camera style. (now its seen in sooooo many games) This game IS NOT BAD, I'm actually sick of RE 1, 2, 3 nostalgic fanboys shitting on this game, because it isn't the clunky, awkward, good old RE game they knew and loved. This game is just CONTROVERSIAL, depending on how open you are to change, and when you starting joining the fan club... I don't like RE7s first person camera angle! Is it a bad game? Hell no it's one of the best games made in 2017! Resident Evil 4 is a great balance between action, and horror which is what this franchise is based upon, I'm preying that Capcom dont try to completely focus on nothing but horror with future releases because that's not what Resident Evil is either. \n\nSo yes I 100% recommend you play this game, the story isn't award winning but who fucking cares it's no Last of Us which is begging for one pretty much. It has replay value with secret unlockables which are challenging and really rewarding, there are honestly terrifying moments in this game, with some bosses and enemies, I think its charming, and badass at the same time. Do not play Resident Evil 4 in the mind set of it being like it's predecessors it just isn't and the Retro RE fanboys shot themselves in the foot really.",Recommended

"Like many, I've played this on a few consoles with it's initial release. Hell, even the original PC version that had no mouse support. What a mess. RE4HD was put together quite well from there though. I do have some complaints about the controls still, and ended up using a controller instead. My best example was that inventory management were all keybound in very awkward areas, and the camera stayed to the left or right when panning over, not returning to center. Those were my only issues. I did download the extra HD mod to enhance it even more, but was still fairly okay even with it's older textures. 0 crashes and bugs, modern systems should have no issues at all. If you have never played RE4 prior, you have not only missed out for many years, you are missing out still to this day.",Recommended

"Not a fan of tank controls, but this is one of the best Resident Evil games and personally my favorite one.\nI use a PS4 controller and unfortunately I had to use trial and error in order to figure out what buttons correspond to what numbers, Triangle is 5, Circle is 4, L2 and R2 are 8 and 9, I died a few times from the part where you run from the giant boulder because I didn't know this beforehand. Also, the game was all slow mo until I changed it to 30 fps in the options menu.\nA little advice for new players\n1 Shoot the crows, they drop money!\n2 Go ahead and blow through all your shotgun/rifle/tmp ammo early in the game because when you see the merchant and upgrade your capacity he gives you a full clip with it.\n3 Using your knife and your kicks can save you a lot of ammo\n4 Shoot the fish, you can pick them up and eat them to restore health or sell them to the merchant\n5 Inventory space can be a problem and there's no item boxes in the game so you're not going to be able to carry every weapon, you can always sell one to the merchant and buy it back later if you want to.\n\nEDIT\n\nBig Picture Mode totally solves the control problems!

"Resident Evil 4 is...\nWhoops, sorry!\nresident evil 4 is a behind-shoulder third-person survival horror that is known to revolutionarized the genre and got all the 10/10 and awards. At least this is what they tell you. resident evil 4 was in development hell for a while. It started as something that spinned off into Devil May Cry 1. Then they tried to make a more direct Code Veronica sequel in Spencer estate and infectous bacteria-virus fog. Then they experiemented with supernatural elements. And tried to make a generic sequel with zombies with Umbrella takedown. In the end, they arrived here. Where? Here. This thing. A more action take on franchise because game's director was frustrated that REmake did not sell high enough for his self-esteem.\n\nresident evil 4 was originally a Gamecube exclusive. It was ported to PS2 afterwards, that director hated at a time. Might or might not have been part of what made him leave Capcom. PS2 version has worse graphics, every cutscene is done as FMV and it also got exclusive content that is Separate Ways. All the later ports would be based off Wii version that is mostly based off combo of Gamecube and PS2. Mostly it means that all is good and jolly aside from Separate Ways having low-quality FMV cutscenes due to being PS2 content, nothing they can do.\n\nSteam version also includes support for 60fps and HD textures. They suck. Game was designed for 30fps and is rather locked to this framerate and I heard that it has glitches and animation inconsistency in 60fps, so don't be a silly and stick to 30fps. It also means that low-end computers will struggle as game slowdowns instead of skipping frames. Frankly, I had no problems playing with all on lowest graphical settings for the most parts and that's without doing any fan fixes. And it's still better than the old PC port. HD textures are miserable. Barely any were properly remade and they often lose the ""dirt"" details. They waste more recources and hard drive space then bring anything. Stick to SD textures.\n\nAlso, soundtrack and art book that were a pre-order bonus were actually really good. Much better than REmake trashy ones, aha.\n\n\nAnyway, game itself. So, have you heard how resident evil 4 was a revolution in survival horror?\nLies, fake news and provocations.\nIt revolutionarized, sure. The third person shooter genre. Survival horror? No way dude. The game playes like an action game and any survival horror leftovers can be contributed to ""RPG elements"". Such as shop and limited inventory. Actually, inventory system is good. They call it Tetris style but there are no complicated shapes, only rectangle. Place items over your attache case. Good stuff, taking the sizes of object into consideration. All the keys and treasure are put into separate infinite space.\n\nI mean, it can't be a survival horror if enemies randomly drop items and $$$.\n\nHowever, it still was a revolution in third person shooters. Think, it was way before Gears of War and such. It was quite possibly the first AAA big game to have behind the shoulder camera. Instead of crosshair it uses laser sight. And what truly separated it at a time in my eyes is that you do different effects on enemies depending on which body part you shoot at. And I don't mean simplistic ""shoot head for higher damage"" that other games used that I hate. All of the body parts matter, not just head. Even shooting head is sometimes not preferable. And some of those shots allow you to follow up with specialized melee. Clunkier controls that feel like Resident Evil evolution due to having to stop in a spot in order to aim and shoot also help in this case, making you more vulnerable.\n\nToo bad it still fails to be a survival horror in setting. Why am I so frustrated? Because the game promises to be one at the beginning. I tell you, the intro part of a game is a panic-inducing genius and in the first third of the game is spent in environment filled with enemies that are so similar to zombies yet aren't zombies. It feels like a survival horror, but you feel under siege in the village. Then, according to ""one of the best pacing in videogames"" we get into castle and we are taken into ride of stupid, both plotwise, because Napoleon midget, and all the wacky mechanic and traps we get. It really feels dragged out here. Shame, cultists are cool, but eh. And then in the island... well, I just quit the game back then as soon as I saw the first minigun zombie. Not to mentioning that it feels like James Bond movie. What is going on?! I mean, it still has those Regenerador monsters as game randomly remembers that it's supposed to have horror elements. But first, those moments feel out of place and make me think ""game didn't deserve it, they should have put it into proper horror game"". And second, they drop $$$, so I went into predator mindset fairly quickly.\n\nAnd yea, plot is stupid and trashes over the metauniverse that they were preparing at that time in the franchise. It also has Ashley, a girl that is twenty years old but acts like a twelwe. Looks like one too, somewhat. She is actually one of the better escort characters until she starts spamming calls for Leon. I didn't feel that she brought much into gameplay however, just made it feel less good. Also, the game is linear. Not too linear but linear enough to make the little ""planted a tracking bug"" pointless, haha.\n\nAh, music is pretty great. So are graphics, at a time. Even if the first third of a game was brown brown brown. Extra games are fun. Mercenaries are back however are arena based, unlike RE3, and characters have unique traits. Separate Ways is trash in the first half but is pretty good in the second half.\n\nOverall, resident evil 4 is one of the better third-person action games? Heck yea. Well. A really good one. Can't call it the best, no way dude. But if somebody calls it a survival horror you punch them into face for being stupid.",Recommended

"For returning players only:\n\nwhat in the fucking world are these controls\n1. If you want to aim with wasd, you have to manually edit your ini files by watching a youtube tutorial. \n2. the keyboard aim is super sensitive so you will be missing a lot of shots, often missing or shooting the hand instead of the head. there's no way to fix keyboard sensitivity because you never meant to aim with keyboard\n3. reload buttons are separated. before you can press the run button while aiming which will reload which is ok. now you can't do that, and it's default to R. what the fuck is this pointless catering to modern shooters? you can't even reload even if you press r if you are not aiming, and you can't make your run key reload as well because it will conflict and won't let you.\n4. use key is separated from fire key, which means before you could aim, shoot, head kick in a smooth fashion but now you have to re-learn the muscle memory and move ur finger off the wasd. \n5. QTEs on pro are very difficult already (im talking about the running from boulders) but due to 60fps they are even harder. It shouldn't be, but it wasn't even addressed in this patch.\n6. Inventory management is........moving item is backspace and rotating item is .........DELETE? WHAT IN THE HELL WERE YOU THINKING. oh and these can't be changed. also camera control options are removed from the keybind menu (in the 2007 version you could) which means you can no longer do semi quick turns (changing camera direction and aiming for a split second)\n7. All the old mods no longer work. only UHD mods could be used.\n8. Alt-tabbing a few times will crash the game.\n\nPros: beautiful smooth 60fps, beautiful textures and menu (barely a pro though) \n\nAll in all, if you have never played it I highly recommend you to get it because it is an amazing game even with controls that you aren't used to.

"What's there left to say about this classic that hasn't already been said? \nReleased in 2005 for the Nintendo GameCube, this gem made quite the splash in the gaming community as it took a tired series and genre in a new direction and shook things up a bit. It would eventually end up inspiring countless other games (Dead Space to name one) and setting a new gaming standard. \nGone from it's predecessors are the fixed camera angles, tank controls, scarce ammunition and traditional bite you-in-the-neck zombies and in is the over the shoulder perspective, slightly updated tank controls, Tetris style inventory system, love it or hate em quick time events and totally-not-zombies-this-time-around: Los Ganados!\nThe story takes place 6 years after Res 2, Leon Kennedy is searching for the presidents kidnapped daughter in some off the beaten path-rural part of Spain, that time seems to have forgotten.\nIt doesn't take long until the villagers go full ""Deliverance"" on Leon just short of having a full blown Banjo duel. \nBut the Ganados make the ""deliverance"" and ""wrong turn"" hillbillies look like a vibrant and charming community in comparison, it doesn't take long until the chainsaw wielding - head sack wearing - leather face looking maniacs come screaming through the forest, ready to separate your head from your body.\nIt's up to you as the player to utilize your environments and weapons to outsmart and outlive your adversaries. \nAt times you will face up towards 10 people swarming you from all sides; screaming what I can only assume are obscenities and commands in Spanish as they try to stop your heart from beating. You have to be quick on your feet and witty to survive. Dive through a window, kick down a ladder or even barricade yourself in a room to escape your pursuers. \nAlthough slow, these guys aren't all sandwiches short of a picknick. For every action you take to outsmart them; they will counter with something in turn. Close a door and they'll break it down. Kick down a ladder and they pick it back up. \nThe only thing left is let your gun do the talking. \nThe shooting is satisfying and powerful. Every shot that connects with the enemy has feedback, shoot them in the head or knee and they can get momentarily staggered -gripping their wounded area as they cry in pain -which you can lead up with a roundhouse kick. Shoot them in the hand and they drop what they are wielding, hell you can even shoot projectiles right out of the air if you are good and fast enough. It's gameplay that rewards skill and accuracy.\nEvery weapon caliber has a different punch: puny pistol ammo makes them groan and stagger, shotgun blasts sends them flying and higher caliber guns such as revolvers and sniper rifles can blow heads clean off with one shot. Explosive weapons turns them into a pink mist and gibs.\nNow the inventory is an interesting one, There is no limitation to how many guns or what guns you choose to have, but note that everything you pick up eats up inventory space. Choose to go minimal with two guns and you can stock more ammo and health, or go big and varied with your arsenal and you might have to avoid picking up precious ammo because it simply won't fit your bag.\n\nNow lets talk about some things that might turn some people off the game:\nNr1: the hybrid-tank controls - Yes, Leon steers like a tank and turns like one as well, but this time in third person. This will be a stark difference when you are used to a game like GTA where the animations are smooth and responsive.\n Leon is stiff and turns like a door opens - in a wide path. He moves like he's recently had rigid surgery or something. Walking backwards is like backing up a British Cromwell tank, but somehow even slower. But there is one silver linning to his stiff movement; the 180 degrees turn. This is your friend, use it well. \nNr2: Stop and shoot - Now this might be the most criticised part of the game. Much like one of those big cranes that need to anchor themselves with support legs to keep them from sliding around or topple over, Leon too needs to steadily plant his support legs into the ground before sending some hot led down the range, you CANNOT move whilst aiming. \nNow, I can only assume that this ""feature"" was added (or removed depending on how you look at it) to increase the tension and feel of insecurity to your surroundings. When you aim; the camera goes from the wider third person angle to the narrower FOV - over the shoulder perspective, making it hard for you to see what's going on around you. You aim slow and loose pretty much all of your peripheral vision when taking aim. Not being able to move also adds to this insecurity and added vulnerability. You have to dedicate yourself to your shooting, be clear of your environment and surrounding and pick the right moments before you inflict your enemies with lead poisoning. \nI for one like this limitation as it feel like it brings a much needed balance between you and your foes- Leon packs everything from a pistol to a literal rpg shoved somewhere down his pants and the villagers have to cope with their sickles, rakes, and in best case scenarios; some form of a projectile like a dynamite or crossbow. Not a level playing field at all.\nIf you could move and aim then it would be like having a sack race with someone except that you aren't in a sack, you are in a Koenigsegg car. The only way to balance that race is to puncture your tires, or hell, even remove them altogether. \n\nNow when you are not shooting up the natives with your small arsenal, then you support Spains pre-euro economy by visiting the black market. You loot your victims and steal their prised family heirlooms and you meet up with a weird trenchcoat wearing guy. This guy is itching to show you what's on the inside of his trenchcoat and every time you interact with him he flashes his goods - weapons arsenal that is. \nHe acts as a mobile store where you can upgrade your weapons, expand your tetris briefcase mini game and buy new weapons to blow up the peasants and wildlife with.\n But for some reason he doesn't sell ammo (I guess that's a safety concern or something, he might sell you the weapon, but not the means to kill with them). The ammo you have to find on the corpses of your non firearms wielding enemies and in boxes, a bit of an oddity that is. But hey, I've learned to accepted that shooting crows give you money and snakes give you eggs, so the ammo from melting corpses and farm boxes shouldn't be too hard a reality to swallow.\nThe environments range from gloomy looking forest villages to castles and everything in between, so you wont be bored with the scenery as every time you start getting used to it, something new lurks around the corner.\n The map levels are split in to smaller hubs with short loading sections in between and can range from corridor-esque multilevel claustrophobic houses to splitting paths and broader areas. \nAnyway, the game is about 15-25 h long on your first play-through. It's extremely replayable with new unlock-able weapons and costumes on higher difficulty's. \nThis version also supports the addictive mercenaries mode where you battle time and enemies on different closed levels for high-scores. Also the separate ways expansion where you play as Ada during the same timeline as Leon, giving you a new perspective on things. \n\nNow on an ending note, this version is by far the best one out there and I should know seeing as I´'ve played the GC, PS3, Wii and PS4 version. \nThis one is in 60 fps, widescreen, has 5.1 surround sound and native controller support (but not PS4 button prompts for some reason). The best part is that it is mod-able, so do yourself a favour and download the res4HD project mod that makes all textures razor sharp and even improves some 3d models whilst still staying Recommended to the original atmosphere and artwork. \nSo yeah, what are you waiting for? Do yourself a favour and play one of the best games in the world.",Recommended

"An HD version of one of the greatest games of all time. Although it's just a remastering, it still holds up well against modern games to date. However, the texture backgrounds are very dated and not as detailed as Resident Evil 5. With that said, the current version is not updated to run on Windows 10. Remember to run the game on windows 7 by locating the actual program in your steam directory and changing it's compatibility mode in the program's properties.

"Definitely in my mind one of the best games I've ever played. \n\nIt has a incredibly unique setting and story, impressive graphics for the time, solid gameplay, and most importantly a good amount of horror elements.\n\nThe game keeps you on the edge of your seat at all times and you truly feel like you're under pressure. Each monster and creature in the game presents a different threat and could pop up at any time, and the places you traverse in the game are all equally unsettling, such as a cathedral full of cultists, a swamp, a village, and a facility. \n\nShockingly for a horror game the main protagonist is easily one of the most charismatic characters ever, constantly spouting cheesy one liners and flipping around like a ninja and it shocks me that Chris appears in the Marvel vs Capcom games instead of Leon.\n\nThe HD graphics are a welcome addition although it actually does change some things asthetically instead of upresing textures which may be distracting to some people and pointless to others. \n\nPlay this game before you die.",Recommended

"This game is a stone cold classic but to enjoy it fully on the PC I needed to install some third party tweaks. Once I did I could play through the whole game without any major problems and experience this amazing game again in a new and improved format.\n\nFollowing the advice over at www.PCGamingWiki.com, I changed the FOV, patched out crashes on 64 bit systems and installed the HD textures from the RE4HD Project team. \n\nI also changed the control scheme in the game settings to the third option for my Xbox One controller. After doing all of this the game runs great with just a little bit of slow down sometimes but nothing major.\n\nResident Evil 4 was directed by Shinji Mikami who also worked on the Evil Within games. When you go back and play this you can really see the similarities in the gameplay and level design. I mean in some cases he literally just reused some elements from this game when making The Evil Within. \n\nHowever both The Evil Within and RE 4 are iconic in their design and I love both games. Shinji Mikami is a very talented videogame designer and this game is very special as a result.\n\nOf course at the time of RE 4’s release it was extremely innovative because of the ‘over the shoulder’ camera angle. This aspect was a huge step forward for the Resident Evil series although it did drive the gameplay more towards action over survival horror.\n\nI think that Resident Evil 4 still manages to be one of the best and most important games in the series though. Mainly because of the fantastic design work done by Shinji Mikami and his team at Capcom. Which enhanced everything that had made Resident Evil games great before it’s release. While also modernising the gameplay mechanics and bringing the series into the future of gaming. \n\nThere is also some really cool unlockable content in this game and it is designed to encourage multiple playthroughs. One of the unlockable campaign modes is actually really interesting and implemented in a very clever way.\n\nIt’s just a shame that Capcom can’t be bothered these days to develop a proper updated version for modern PCs. Anyway, we should be grateful to the third party developers such as the guys at www.re4hd.com for showing this game the love it deserves. \n\nResident Evil 4 is an iconic classic and a primary example of innovation in video game design. It embodies all that’s great in the Resident Evil series and is of course still worth playing today.\n\nI highly recommend it as one of the best!",Recommended

"Honestly one of the most polished action horror games ever made. I've owned it on Gamecube, played it again on the ps2 and Wii, and now i own it again on PC.   For 20 bucks you get a long singleplayer game, with a bunch of bonuses and extras such as The Mercenaries mode which is all gameplay no story.  Along with that you get all additional content added to the game over the various versions such as Seperate ways and extra silly costumes. \n\nThe only downside to this release however, is that the actual HD remaster is not as polished 100%.  The cutscenes in the non main story modes are low resolution.  Its a minor flaw.  By now I imagine not many people have not played RE 4 given its prolific run of being released on nearly every platform since the gamecube.  If you haven't, you cant really go wrong with this release.",Recommended
"I bought this for the RE4 HD Project mod and after five days of installing, uninstalling and troubleshooting I can't get it to work. The thing is, I'm not really sure who to blame here; the authors of the mod, the publisher or my own incompetance. I've tried installing it with different options, patching and re-patching the executable, running it with and without the July 2018 silencer patch, nothing works. Either way, I'm disappointed. If this ever gets Steam Workshop support, I might consider picking it up again, but I struggle to recommend it right now.\n\nThis should be the easiest thing to recommend in the world, too. It's a PC port of Resident Evil 4, for crying out loud! One of the most suspenseful, influential and funny horror-themed action games I've played! Instead, I can't overlook how underwhelming the overall package is.\n\nThe option to play in 60 frames-a-second sounds nice on paper, but it doesn't quite work in practice. Whilst the gameplay looks and feels great in this mode, the animations are completely botched. Any sort of particle effect (fire, banners, curtains etc.) still plays at 30, and a large number of them play twice as fast, making any sort of quick time event involving a rapid button press much more difficult, and sometimes they don't give you the right button prompts!\n\nSo long as you have a controller around, it's not the *worst* version I've ever played, it could just be a lot better.",Not Recommended
"For many, this game is a masterpiece and while it may very well be a great action game, it really doesn't capture the Resident Evil feel.\n\nIf you've played the previous games, the first thing you'll notice is the camera. The game abandons the fixed camera structure and embraces and over-the-shoulder point of view making it clear that the focus has shifted from exploration and resource management to action. This is not a bad thing by itself, but combined with the rest of the game structure, it results in a letdown.\n\nThe reasons playing this game was a negative experience for me are:\n[list]\n    [*]The controls are terrible. They're just one step away from tank controls, so mobility is very limited. Aiming is done with the guns' laser pointers and it's unresponsive at best. Maybe at the time they could have been considered good, today they're just pitiful\n    [*]The setting is unispired and low on details. The maps are mostly corridors, there's very little branching and this strongly impacts the exploration (and by ""strongly impacts"" I mean that it's nonexistent).\n    [*]Inventory management is only related to weapons, ammo and health items. Key items are stored in a separated (and virtually endless) inventory.\n    [*]There are maybe two puzzles that require to be more intelligent than a chair and one of the two is optional. The rest of them are straightforward to say the least.\n    [*]There are QTEs everywhere. Yes, 10 years ago they were cool, today they're not.\n[/list]\n\nIt may just be that it didn't age well, but in 2018 there are way better action and horror games out there.",Not Recommended

Easily one of the best games ever. it has its flaws like being kinda buggy but if you can find a fix and enjoy it its a heck of a ride,Recommended
"So this is my first time playing the game, ever. I'm not sure how much this version differs from the Gamecube version but I have to say that RE4 was (most likely) way ahead of its time. It's basically a third person shooter wherein you move relatively slow and shoot slow-moving infected Europeans and monsters in a way that is supremely satisfying.\n\nThe only things that annoy me are as follows: there's no volume control. This can be annoying when you want to listen to a YouTube podcast, creepypasta or Howard Stern episode and the game volume always drowns out the audio of the video you're trying to listen to in the background. Luckily for me, certain podcasts I enjoy are posted on sites where I can crank that sheeeiiit up so I had a workaround. \n\nAlso, certain bosses(Krauser) only have specific moments where your shots inflict damage and sometimes it's really hard to tell when those moments are. \n\nFurthermore, there were select moments where the game got realllyyyy laggy and I don't think it had anything to do with my PC. Given that these moments were extremely few and far between it's not a huge issue. It's worth noting that about halfway through the game a quick cutscene showing a bridge moving was of really PS2-esque quality for some reason. Maybe they forgot to remaster that one and only cutscene. \n\nLastly, and I know this has been a staple of games for quite some time now... DIFFICULTIES THAT YOU HAVE TO UNLOCK BY BEATING THE GAME. I hate this so much. Just a personal gripe. Maybe it makes somewhat more sense in this scenario than it does for say Max Payne 3 which had you beat the game three times to get all of the difficulty achievements since each unlockable difficulty had vaguely different rules but I digress. I just hate playing through a game and starting over again only for it to be harder. Especially this game because Professional mode is fucking impossible. Although you do get unlimited RPG ammo and the same for another gun, and all of the cutscenes are skippable so... win some lose some.\n\nNow on to the good, this game was simply a load of fun. Just a satisfying journey of shooting meaty enemies with a healthy plethora of upgradable weapons. Tons of tense moments and even a few scares here and there. There's really now a whole lot to complain about when it comes to the gameplay element. It takes a little getting used to but once you get used to it, you feel like a total bada$$ especially once you start leveling up your health and making your guns OP.\n\nThe game is honestly one of the funniest fucking games I have played in quite some time I have to say. At first I thought that it was an unintentional comedy but as the story progresses, I have to believe they knew what they were doing. It starts relatively grounded in reality and quickly becomes outrageous. I can't remember the last time I played through a single player campaign and laughed my ass off so many times. \n\nOnly in Japan will you get a mix of genuine horror, hot ladies with a handful of panty shots thrown in, cheesy characters that all look either super ugly or super pretty, stupid fight scenes and tons of jarring humor. It's an acquired taste that this game hits perfectly.\n",Recommended

From the very first cutscene, everything is horribly out of sync, there is a terrible delay (like a full second or two) making all the cutscenes essentially unwatchable. \n\nNext, the fps I get during gameplay is equally as terrible, even I on the lowest resolution and texture settings - I get horrible framerate lag, despite this never happening with any other much newer, graphically better games. \n\nFinally I have no idea what is going on with the controller button configurations - it allows me remap every button (and responds perfectly fine in the menus) but as soon as I start the actual game it just doesn't work. I tried everything, restarted multiple times, remapped the buttons multiple times, and even different controllers; it simply refuses to work.\n\nI truly love this game, it's one of my favorites from my childhood but it is quite literally unplayable.",Not Recommended

"Still Hold up after 13 Years, the Graphics are ok for a game this old, but they get the job done fine.\n\nGameplay may feel still at first (must remember this was one of the earlybirds to this kind of camera angle/ movement system), but you eventually pull of headshots perfectly as the controls feel smoother and more responsive as you go on.\nGameplay intoduced some of the first enemy reactions to being wounded, such as falling over after being shot in the leg, or shooting a throwing axe out of midair. The ""Survival-Horror"" aspect is almost flawless, as I always felt like I could go on with what I had, but could also desperatley need more, at all times, Forcing me to both consider the situation but also go through with it in the first place, showing how item placement and availabiltiy can make or break this genre (looking at you, Re6, with those 12 stock grenades (I still love you though)) However I was able to save up like 40 magnum rounds for the final boss. The Merchant provides an ease-of-access desion maker for your loadout, buy a firepower upgrade or a bigger case?\nStory is decently lengthed, along with a healthy chunk of side content mostly starring everyone's favourite Asian-American. \n\nThere is a reason this game is called a Masterpeice and the best in the series.\nWhile i'd need a few more QoL improvements for a masterpiece, I gladly agree with the latter statement.",Recommended

It also was the game to do the over the shoulder perspective right. Now while i do have my own kinks i can safely say this game is worth your $20. \nPros: \nYou get resident evil 4 with somewhat new graphics.\nNothing has really changed.\nGameplay is still as fun and as challenging as it used to be.\nCamera is still very nice and still works well.\n$20 price tag for an amazing game that still is alot of fun today.\nNo micro-transactions however game devs actually made their games with love and also made all content unlockable.\n\nCons:\nGraphics arent as good as i had hoped.\nSome bugs but none that are game breaking.\nNothing has really changed.\nSome cutscenes in hd some are not.\nGame can feel repetitive at times over a long 5 or 6 hour campaign.\n\nMost of my cons are small nit-picks but i still dont like that the graphics were not truly imptoved upon.

"I wanted to like this game, I love the series, I love the genre, and I absolutely hate giving this a negative review, but the controls are some of the worst I have ever experienced.\n\nThe control setup is the standard Resident Evil tank controls, which im fine with, but in a third person shooter tank controls fall flat because you cant see whats to your left, as Leon is in the way.  Normally seeing the otherside of our character isnt bad with tank controls, but those games where that style of control works have cameras in fixed locations or farther away from the camera, where you can see where you're going. Being on the younger side myself, i did not grow up in an era where there were tank controls, which probably didnt help.\n\nI am sorry to say that I cannot reccomend this game. BUT I do reccomend Resident Evil Revelations, both 1/2, for being great 3PS, and good survival horror (well, the second anyways). Play those instead if you dont like tank controls.",Not Recommended

"I have been a gamer forever. Last year I bought all the Resident Evil games, I recently had some time on my hands, so I decided to give them a go, I beat #1, 0, then I moved to 4. I was REALLY on the fence about this game. I knew the controls were completely different then the others. I also got really sick the first hour of playing it. I learned its best with a controller and rolling back a little. Get some space between you and the screen. After that this game has been awesome. I actually beat it pretty quick, around 16 hours. This is the first game I ever beat, and then started the game again with the carry over items and money. There are many things they have fixed from the previous games: \n- upgradable storage - this is huge, really helps with inventory \n- upgradable weapon \n- you dont have to put an item in your inventory to use it right away, there is a ""USE"" option. FANTASTIC \n\nWhile I generally HATE escort missions, these were not too bad, there was ways to get her out of the way when needed. \nWhen you beat the game your phones and items carry over, really encourgages you to replay, and you unlock extras that way.

"Let me preface by saying that i play games whilst Steam is set to ""offline"" mode, so my recorded in-game time is actually much longer than shown here. I've owned this game on the GC, the PS2, the Wii, the PS3 (the HD port with Code Veronica), and most recently, this version of the PC port. That might indicate i have a slight addiction to collecting games various versions of games haha. Anyhow; this version is by far the best one, minus a few niggling optimization issues (at least iwth my PC, i can't speak for anyone else's experiences), but i have experienced slowdown (such as in the ""Water Room"" for example). It doesn't happen all the time, but when i have the game running at 60fps, and it suddenly drops to 15fps, it's a real pain in the tush. It has also happened when entering/exiting the inventory screen, but that's random as well. Aside from those issues (and the crappy soundbites used for Leon in Separate Ways), the game plays fine and i've not had any cheap deaths due to glitches or bugs. I would recommend the HD Texture pack as well, as it really goes a long way to sprucing the game up to modern standards graphically, while also improving on the original art assets and enhancing environmental details such as lighting, shadows, particle effects and so on.",Recommended

"TL DR: Resident Evil 4 has awful crap such as half the game being an escort mission, tank controls in a shooter, dumb QTEs and a brown shit filter. It's also a really good game despite all of this. The combat is terrific, and the game almost never seems to make you feel at ease while in it. While not truly ""scary"", RE4 gets you pumped to survive whatever's ahead of you, and the ways in which you have to do so are very well done. ★★★★☆\n\nResident Evil 4 is a third person shooter where you play as an American agent called Leon S. Kennedy, tasked with saving the US president's daughter in a Spanish village whose inhabitants seem to worship a strange cult. The game's story never stops being dumb and badly written, but it's thoroughly entertaining. Roughly half of the game has you escorting said president's daughter, which does sound incredibly annoying, but she doesn't require a lot of babysitting, as she stands behind you while you shoot, and if you've got a minimum amount of care for what's behind you, you should be fine.\n\nYou really have to watch your back (and sides) in this game, since Leon occupies half the screen, the game has tank controls (A and D rotate you instead of strafing), the aiming is slow on purpose and it requires you to be still while doing so. The controls were clunky for a few minutes, but you get used to it quick, and RE4 wouldn't work as well otherwise. Having such a low awareness of your surroundings, you get forced to retreat into places where you know (or you think you do) that the only enemies around will be near Leon's laser sight and on screen. With the obligation of standing still while shooting, this makes for an experience in constant retreat to corners with several enemies walking at you.\n\nEnemies are slow and not overly aggressive. Since they're slow, their attacks can afford to do more damage, as you can more easily dodge them. You can also shoot their arms to cancel the attack, or shoot the projectiles mid-air. This also extends to shooting legs and making enemies fall on the floor for easy knife-spam kills, or headshots which can lead into a roundhouse kick for crowd control, and maybe more easy knife-spam. As such, the game provides a pretty good way of conserving ammo, though I can't say I ever truly ran out, since enemies' drops adapt to what you lack (money/ammo/healing), and so you never truly run out, though unless you're conserving ammo to the max, you'll never have a major stockpile of it. Because of all this, RE4's combat feels great. One headshot can lead to a major crowd-control kick, a leg shot can lead to a high-damage suplex move, and the guns in general are really satisfying (the shotgun feels like firing a shockwave which knocks back tons of enemies). And because of its level design, most of the game feels really tense in combat, since you can never quite predict what's coming.\n\nThe level design does start to drop its quality though. While the first big change in environment still had some great levels despite not having such a good horror mood, the final act was a bit underwhelming. I suppose that by then, your weapons are fully upgraded and the designers gave up doing something that feels so tense, since you're gonna blast through it easier, but it starts to feel like there's a lot of being locked in a room and having to turn switches. The combat is still really good, but the enemies and level design ease off on the great tension the game had until then (except for some... regenerating exceptions, though those also get boring).\n\nWhile RE4 isn't really a horror game, it's a really good shooter which makes you tense while you enjoy its great combat. Despite its clunky controls and sometimes annoying QTEs, it's still very good.",Recommended
"As much as I loved RE4 on the PS2, this is unplayable because of the slow motion lag. I'm glad I bought it when it was on sale instead of paying full price.",Not Recommended
"I don't know how good I can be at this game without the chainsaw controller.\n\nResident Evil 4 says its the 4th game in the series, but according to this release order it's the 14th game in the series so someone is fibbing to me. And we all know fibbing is wrong. \n\nYou play as Leon .S. Kennedy, one of the protagonists from Resident Evil 2. After RE2, Leon spent many days practicing back flips until a government agent saw him and went “Woah, that's a lot of back flips!” And recruited him into the president daughter saver guy division. \nWith no president daughter to save, Leon worked on his hair and one liners until a president's daughter was finally kidnapped and he had something to do. So Leon and two guys who don't matter go to a remote village in Spain so he can ask people who speak Spanish questions in English. \n\nClearly perturbed by the American man breaking into his home and speaking in a language he doesn't know, the Spanish man attempts to defend himself, and it all just spirals out of control from there. \n\nResident Evil 4 has a long development history. The earliest rendition I know of was re-purposed into Devil May Cry. Another one I know about was a more traditional Resident Evil game with fixed camera perspective and everything, BUT with the addition of over the shoulder aiming. Then someone developing the game was like “Hey, why don't we make...The whole game like this?” And everyone just kind of went with it. \n\nThe game came out in 2005 and everyone lost their minds, given 10 out of 10s across the board. But does the game hold up to this day!?!? \nYeah, it's pretty good. \n\nResident Evil 4 still maintains the tank controls from previous games, only now the view is over-the-shoulder and you can actually aim where you shoot. Which is a good thing because you're going to be doing a lot more murder in this game than previous games. Shooting at vital points like legs or the face, because taking a bullet to the face apparently hurts a lot, usually ends up stunning your enemies and opening them up for a super cool karate kick. Not only is it cool, but it helps with ammo conservation. \n\n\nRE4 however, drops any notion of being a survival horror game really quick. There are some tense moments at the start of the game, especially while the potato doctor tries to give you a proctology exam with a chainsaw, but for the most part, the tensest part of the game is managing your ammo from encounter to encounter.\nAnd you WILL be killing a lot of things in this game. I think I clocked in at around 968 kills, compared to the 80 I killed in Resident Evil 1. \n\nThere was complains about the game being one big escort mission, but I like Ashley, she's cool. She doesn't really get in the way, and I think only one guy was able to pick her up for a split second before I put him down. In later playthroughs you can even give her a suit of armor so she cant be picked up at all, in case that part was such a problem to you.\nShe's neat, I want to hold her hand. \n\nResident Evil 4 is also a considerate and tender lover, serving you breakfast in the form of neat stuff after your first run with the game. Aside from costumes like the aforementioned armor for Ashley, you can get Leon his old RPD uniform as well as a gangster suit with a hat that has not aged well.\nYou also get the ability to buy special weapons from the merchant after you beat the game. With stuff like the Infinite rocket launcher and the Chicago Typewriter, which is just...Its just so good. Who needs the rocket launcher when you can just tear up everything like you're in a Al Pacino movie? \n\nResident Hazard 4 is good fun. The second half is actually kind of weak (Save for the best helicopter scene in video game history) and some of the boss fights can be kind of lame. But Leon is a fun guy, and the shooting and general gameplay is something worth experiencing. \nIts not actually scary, some people had problems with one enemy in the game, but they didn't really get me with the spooks. \n\nBio Evil 4 gets ninety eight back flips out of forty or something. \n\nSanta Anna had a state funeral for his  leg. \n\n[url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/7124597/]Check out the curator, where we constantly try to stop one of our members from making human sacrifices in an attempt to make monster girls real.

"50%\n\n""Resident Evil 4"" is now in HD -- but otherwise it's the same 3rd person, over-the-shoulder shooter from 2005. Sadly, the problem with it wasn't just the graphics. Another massive issue is the absolutely depressing movement system and clumsy design when ported to PC.\n\nDon't get me wrong, this game has an amazing atmosphere and chills you from the start. But stumbling around awkwardly with a system that only sometimes responds to key presses in rational ways, absolutely totally ruins that. Why does the gun sight not light up on tree trunks or walls, only on zombies? Why does turning sideways to walk require 3 key presses? \n\nI returned ""Resident Evil 4"". It isn't fun.

"TL;DR - Was an alright game for the time, but isn't all that great today. Buy it if you harbor some nostalgia and want to play it in HD. (There are actually some weird graphical issues, such as rifle reloading and explosion animations having a slower framerate and water effects running insanely fast. So maybe just get it on the GC/PS2?)\n\nDespite having many great memories of this game via the Gamecube, PS2 and even some time spent on the Wii, I can't say my return to it was all that enjoyable. Some of the enviroments are still quite nice and I enjoy the tone of the game overall, and meticulously searching for things hidden in obscure corners is a peculiar thing I love in games. The combat, however, is just awful, slow ponderous and is eventually needlessly annoying and arduous. \n\n(Spoilers) The game sort of peaks around the moment enemies heads pop and parasites swing wildly at you, but then that same threat just becomes a rather joyless chore by the very next chapter. Take a few shots, back up, take a few shots, kick, maybe throw a flash grenade...rinse and repeat for most enemies til the end of the game. Add in the fact you have to escort another character quite frequently, which is NEVER fun, it just becomes a rather tedious affair that goes on for far too long. Which is a real shame given that the first few hours are still a good laugh. I felt like that back on the original Gamecube version, and it certainly hasn't appealed to me any more over the years.\n\nMy condolences to the Merchant, you're a fantastic character with some of the best lines I've ever heard in a game...",Not Recommended

"RE 4 is a good game. The setting is interesting and certain scenarios can get the heart racing. BUT ... RE 4 took the RE series in a direction from its original mystery, riddle, puzzle solving, and inventory management days where you had to carefully be mindful of how you spend resources, which made the originals popular, to what seems like a game that's more heavily focused on shooting mixed with horror. To alot, this was neat because RE 4 was many peoples first RE game. But to me who's first was RE 2, RE 4 was a game that was good, but lost it's touch when it took the RE series to a direction where the game's just became generic shooters with the horror and mystery elements almost completely removed and replaced with absured riddiculousess.\n\nAs for the games gameplay mechanics, this port is probably best played with a controller as the mouse and keyboard tend to feel a bit awkward. Some of the enemies you'll encounter are well thought out and can be pretty terrifying. RE 4 also has decent replay value due to end game unlockables that'll make another play through enjoyable.",Recommended

"Thank you so much for the generous sale. It would be a huge waste of money for me because Resident evil 4 and 6 already came out a long time ago on PS2/PS3 and I didn't need it at all for PC. The only reason why I bought it was for the achievements and badges.\n\nI'm a Resident Evil Veteran. Played Resident Evil 2, Code Veronica X, 4, 5, 6 and bonus alternatives like Resident Evil Outbreak 1 and 2. Resident Evil is one of the very few PERFECT AND BEST games I have ever played and I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT! If you were born in 2005 or later, (young generations), give this game a try. I played RE2 around your age, age 10 on my friends N64 and I loved it. Game was so scary back then. Not now but when it first came out, this was the scariest game ever! This game is so freaking good, it had awards like ""game of the year"" and all those stickers you find in books. Trust me, this game is so WORTH IT!",Recommended
"You all know how amazing this game is, but you may not know about the million different version and don't know which you should buy. So I'll quickly cover each of them.\n\nGamecube -\nThe original version of the game. Has all of the original content. Plus, this game feels like it's made for the Gamecube controller. Play it for the most classic experience.\n\nPS2-\nHas worse graphics than the Gamecube version, and no real-time cutscenes, but adds the Seperate Ways campaign, new costumes, and a new weapon. There's not a lot of reason to play this version today, but it goes for much cheaper than the Gamecube version.\n\nPC (2007)-\nThis version was actually a port of the PS2 version, meaning it has inferior graphics to the Gamecube version but does have the extra content. I would never recomend playing this version, as it's a very sloppy port and has lots of problems. Even this version has its good aspects, though, because it has a large collection of fan-made mods to try out. If you love mods, this version may be worth a closer look.\n\nWii-\nBy far the best version of the game. It has the graphics of the Gamecube version, the content from the PS2 version, and very well-done motion controls. You can swing the knife quickly by slashing with the remote, there's motion-enabled QTEs, and best of all, you can aim with the Wii Remote. If you can only play one version, I'd reccomend this.\n\nPS3/360-\nThis version is kinda boring. It's the Wii port without motion controls and in 720p. Out of all the versions, this is my least favorite because there's no reason to play it now.\n\nPS4-\nAgain, the Wii version, but now at 1080p! The most interesting thing about this port is that it's on the Xbox One, which has got to be the worst-selling version of this game. Play this only if you want 1080p but can't run the PC (2014) version. \n\nPC (2014)-\nThe Steam version! A much better port than the 2007 version, though you may have trouble running it if your PC is weak. Higher resolution, higher framerate, fanmade mods, and the rifle's reload animation is still shit. Some things never change.\n\nSwitch-\nI know this version doesn't actually exist, but we all know it's coming. It's likely going to be the PS4 version but with motion controls like the Wii version. This could very easily become the definitive version of the game. Plus, it'd be portable!\n\n\nOverall, any version of this game is worth playing because this game is amazing, but I'd personally reccomend the PC (2014) version for resolution, framerate, and content, the Wii version for motion controls and content, and the Gamecube version for the original experience and the best traditional control scheme. Also, the Zeebo version exists. It's horrible, but Dr. Salvador makes the worst sound I've ever heard in it, so it's worth it for that and the right to say you bought a Zeebo for hundreds of dollars just to play Resident Evil 4 again, despite owning countless versions of it.",Recommended

Probably the greatest game ever.,Recommended
"[h1][b][i]Resident Evil 4[/i][/b][/h1]\n\n[h1]Recommended purchase point: [b]FULL PRICE[/b][/h1]\n\nResident Evil 4 is, on any platform, one of the greatest games ever released - a cultural landmark that popularised the over-the-shoulder camera style (nice) and also popularised Quick-Time Events (oops). The game also marks a major transition in the Resident Evil series from survival horror to action horror - a move that, while polarising, broadened the appeal of the series immensely.\n\n[h1]STORY[/h1]\nSix years after the Raccoon City disaster, Umbrella's wrongdoing has been exposed and the company is finished. Former rookie cop and Raccoon City survivor Leon Kennedy is now a highly trained Secret Service agent, assigned as a bodyguard to the daughter of the President of the United States. Unfortunately for him, she is kidnapped immediately before his duties are to commence and he finds himself embarking on a rescue mission to the European country of Not Spain.\n\nAt this point [i]Resident Evil[/i] has clearly realised how ridiculous its story premises actually are, and for the first time decides to lean into it on purpose. RE4 is presented with the tone of a action B-movie, with Leon spouting piles of cheesy one-liners and cringe-worthy (in a good way) banter with the game's supporting characters and villains. This tongue-in-cheek approach to a horror story pays off dividends, creating one of the most effortlessly charming experiences in gaming. \n\nCapcom even manages to use the more jocular tone of the game to its advantage - juxtaposing the humour of the narrative with some of the genuinely terrifying scenes and setpieces in the game heightens the effect of both.\n\n[h1]GAMEPLAY[/h1]\nEven if you haven't played [i]Resident Evil 4[/i], it's likely at this point that you've played a game that imitated it. RE4's over-the-shoulder gameplay suited the tank controls of the series perfectly, and allowed for veritable hordes of infected enemies to assail the player. Leon is far more capable in this game than than he was in [i]Resident Evil 2[/i] as well - effortlessly crashing through second story windows, barricading doors and engaging in hand-to-hand combat with the infected, his Secret Service training is plainly apparent. \n\nThe threat in RE4 is thus less individual enemies, as it was in the older games in the series, but more a war of attrition. Not only will the player soon find their ammo stockpiles running low, but they also need worry about their levels of concentration. A single misstep can spell disaster for Leon, and that misstep grows more likely by the second as the player desperately tries to handle a multitude of oncoming threats at once.\n\nThe real genius of RE4 lies in its adaptive difficulty, however. The game carefully cultivates its own experience on the fly to keep the player in a constant state of barely hanging on, subtly raising or lowering the difficulty of combat encounters based on past performance. Additionally, the game attempts to keep the player in a constant state of 'just enough' resources, withholding ammo drops to well-stocked players but making them more abundant to the desperate. It's a masterfully designed system that spawned a legion of imitators.\n\n[h1]PRESENTATION[/h1]\nRE4 effortlessly veers between B-movie schlock and genuine moments of fear, seemingly knowing exactly when to dial up one and dial down the other. Its graphics have held up well, owing to strong art design. Its sound design is a masterclass - the soundtrack pulses rasping, discordant music at you during combat encounters, punctuated by the frequent shouts of communication in Spanish between enemies. It's very difficult to find anything to fault about the experience.\n\n[h1]CONCLUSION[/h1]\nNear the top of the list of greatest games ever created, and certainly one of the most influential. Holds the record for being my most frequently purchased games - I have bought it for 4 different platforms now and regret none of the purchases. Worth a purchase at full price, an absolute steal at anything less.",Recommended

"[quote]Hello stranger[/quote]\n\nToday we have a truly historical review - a game from the past, back to 2005. The game, which showed the Recommended power of cinematic inside the game in 2005 and which has changed the development of the genre in a brand new way. And the game is - The Resident Evil 4 or better known as Biohazard 4.\n\nThe plot of Biohazard begins in a small settlement in the middle of Central Europe. Here we meet special agent Leon Kennedy, who comes in the middle of nowhere to search for the missing daughter of the president of the United States. Instantly, in the beginning, we understand that our enemies are slightly specific - they are half-dead zombies, puppets in the hands of an unknown antagonist, figures who worship the religious cult of Los Illuminations and who are controlled by the unknown and deadly Las Plagas virus. Without any delay, we come directly into the fight but we are not prepared for it - neither with the ammunition nor with knowledge of the problem and enemies. The virus also infects both the protagonist and Ashley, the daughter of the president (she was mentioned seconds ago). Therefore, almost all of the plotline twists are built around the struggle for the actual heroes state. Locations, enemies, bosses - everything develops with each level, become dangerous and deadly. Actually, as well as the Leon himself - you open new and new stuff to fight with half-living devils.\n\nIt is worth to be mentioned that during complicated and confusing plot \nLeon receives a little help from different other side-characters. All of them are colorful, such as antagonists, led by Ozmund Sadler, actually the head of the Los Illuminatos cult. The plan to capture the world fails eventually and the desire to take revenge on Leon and Ashley goes to the forefront.\n\n[h1]The verdict[/h1]\nThis game has full rights to be called ""the classic"" - it was the basis for such great projects as Gears of War or The Evil Within, a series known in the world for a long time. It does not have a cool graphics component, but a well-thought-out design of levels/enemies in a cooperation of action scenes is worth to get acquainted with Resident Evil 4. The game is worth itself, but to all non-fans, I advise to buy it with a discount. In addition, there is an HD version with some major changes in game controls\n\n9 infected from 10",Recommended

"Resident Evil 4 is on every list of ""the games you should play before you die"" for good reason. It's just a really well-paced adventure that's never boring and has not an ounce of filler, and if anything, it's even MORE fun to play now than it was in 2005, since most modern action games are filled with too many dull side quests and open world collectibles. It's not exactly a ""survival horror"" game anymore (more of a ""survival action"" one), and is actually really goofy most of the time, especially when Leon starts suplexing dudes and making their heads explode. If you're an actual Spainard you'll probably also find this game hilarious because apparently all of the Spanish people in it sound Mexican.\n\nI recommend downloading the HD texture pack, made by two super dedicated fans who have actually travelled through Europe to take photographs that were then used to update the game's graphics: http://www.re4hd.com/\n\nYou can also check out my longer review here, along with thoughts on the other Resident Evil games: http://pixelgrotto.tumblr.com/post/174717937836/the-horrific-resident-evil-playthrough-part-seven",Recommended

"This was a good resident evil game all around. Some people say this is the best one ever released, but i beg to differ. I think that Resident evil 2 is the best one, but number 1 isn't far behind. I haven't played Resident evil since gamecube, and this gave me those good ole resident evil feelings and memories. I know this game has been out for a long time and it was just re-mastered onto PC 4 years ago, but It's still really cool how they kept the oldschool typewriter to save and the old items and menu. I really got that Resident evil feel. I was giving this game as a gift, but i would still tell someone to buy it because it's a lengthy game and worth it.\n\nPros:\n\n- Suspenseful music/moments\n- Great cut scenes\n- Lots of head explosions\n- There's a trader\n- Good story\n- Different types of enemies\n\nCons:\n\n- Bad camera angle\n- Game is choppy\n- Controls for PC are terrible",Recommended
"[i]Resident Evil 4[/i] is a third-person shooter. My main reason for not recommending this game are its awful, outdated, clunky controls. Your player character can't strafe. He can only move forward or backward, and -slowly- turn left or right. What's more, when you turn the character left or right, the camera doesn't rotate at the same time. You need to move the mouse in unison the whole time. \n\nSo you're almost always pressing three buttons while running (run + forward + left or right) and on top of that, you're making constant swipes with the mouse to actually see where you're going. That's a lot of player input required for what should be a simple action i.e. running around the game world.\n\nUsing a controller makes moving your avatar a bit more bareable. It does mean having to play 'twin stick', one stick to turn the character and one stick to turn the camera, which is something you need to get used to. But as always, a controller makes aiming during combat a lot more clumsy compared to using a mouse. This is the PC version, after all, and a mouse is the one major advantage of playing shooter games on PC.\n\nI'm a bit of a fan of the Resident Evil universe, so I really wanted to like this game that many people consider one of the very best in the series. I gave it a try for several hours, but I just can't get used to the awkward controls. This game is just too outdated for new players to enjoy. It seems a modern control scheme (including being able to strafe) was implemented as of [i]Resident Evil 5[/i], so I'm looking forward to playing that one instead.\n\nThere are a few other noteworthy things about [i]Resident Evil 4[/i] that I found to be a bit of a letdown.\n\n- Normal enemies aren't zombies this time around, but regular humans. That's a letdown in and by itself, because it makes the whole game a lot less thrilling. But the fact that these regular humans (farmers, to boot, so no trained soldiers or the likes) can take four or five shots to the head and still come charging at you, is laughable and makes every enemy feel like a bullet sponge.\n\n- Quick-Time Events (QTE). I hate them. There's also a bug involved with them: as the PC version can run at 60 FPS instead of 30 FPS, the game expects you to mash QTE buttons twice as fast, too. In some cases, this is pretty much impossible. You can fix the problem by setting the game to 30 FPS in the options menu, but this again proves this PC port isn't very PC friendly. \n\n- The voice actors sound ridiculous as they're supposed to voice Spanish characters, but they're clearly Mexican (or at least putting on a thick Mexican accent). To us Europeans, that sounds just as ridiculous as alleged seasoned Americans being voiced by a bunch of actors with a distinct British accent, or vice versa.\n\n- The game's features mention English subtitles but that's not accurate. When you set the game's language to English, you can't enable subtitles at all. You can only enable French, German, Spanish or Italian subtitles if you set the game to one of those languages.\n\n- Leon as the protagonist. I think he's the least interesting and the least colourful of the main characters in the Resident Evil series, compared to Jill, Chris, Claire, Barry and some other characters who almost came to life due to an interesting background story, palpable personality and distinct character traits.",Not Recommended

"[h1]One of the only games to stand the test of time and it does so with flying colours[/h1]\n\nOh boy RE4. What the fuck haven't you heard about RE4 already? \nIf nothing (where have you been living?) then stick around. If something, you know what you're getting into: a good old dick-sucking.\n\n[h1]Anyway, Resident Evil 4 is easily one of the best games of all time and it cannot be denied by anyone.[/h1]\n\n[b]To note: I only finished this game in 2017 (finally, am I right?) and I STILL firmly believe it to be one of the greats in video games and one that everyone should try in their lives.[/b]\n\nAlright, let's cut to the chase:\n\n[h1]STORY[/h1]\n\nThis is a cheesy, B-Movie like premise that goes more and more ridiculous as the playtime increases. You are an incredibly hot dude named Leon who is tasked to go by himself to a general area near a Spanish village in Europe to... rescue the USA President's daughter, which was kidnapped by cultists.\n\nI am not joking.\n\nNow, you're wondering how this can work, right? It... somehow does... perfectly. \nIt's nothing to write home about. You literally fight an entire plague infested city/village (village makes it sound small when in reality, you go from a village to a gigantic castle, to swamps, to mines, to an island, etc. The level variety is immense!) by yourself, to rescue the president's daughter and find out what is happening.\n\nMUDDAHFUKKEN ZAMBIES, THAT'S WHAT HAPPENIN'!\n\nYes, there are zombies.\n\n[b]WAIT! Don't leave just yet! I know zombies and gaming have had a tough relationship lately but hold up![/b]\n\nThe zombies are actually smart and the AI is praise-worthy! Not only does the AI get tougher the better you play (yeah... it's as awesome and balanced as it sounds (for real)) but also the zombies themselves are infected with a virus named Las Plagas: They are still able to both communicate and use weapons, as well as some to metamorph into uglier (and harder to kill) creatures, making enemy variety a plus here. There are alot of different enemies, all tough but fun to battle, making the WHOLE game fun and interesting to keep going, which is just... so rare these days.\n\nI digress a bit here. Back to the story: witty, smart and light-hearted writing that somehow makes all characters likeable and interesting and also helps keep the game charming throughout the 20 hours it took me to beat the game (yes it's long. No, it's not too long).\nThe game can be downright funny at times with Leon constantly annoying the antagonists (right before he kicks their ass).\nThe progression of the plot AND the level veriety is well done and the ending is, while simple and predictable, still enjoyable and conclusive enough to put a smile on anyone's face.\n\nI basically approached the whole game right here... fml\n\n[h1]GAMEPLAY[/h1]\n\nThe problem of the game: the controls are very, very, VERY different than those present in pretty much... any other modern game in existance. The camera sticks very close to your right shoulder and the mouse doesn't move it (much). You need to enter aim mode (Right Mouse Button) to aim, and THEN you can actually move the camera with the mouse. The traditional sticky camera outside aim mode is moved with the character.\n\nLeon moves right, so does the camera. Leon moves lef... okay, you get it.\n\nHow does he do this, then?\n\nD and A, respectively: so, instead of the traditional A strafes left and D strafes right like all other third person shooters from the past 5,000 decades, RE4 controls like the original RE's of sorts: you rotate Leon and move forward to move to a different direction.\n\nThis sounds and IS VERY clunky at first, I struggled alot for the first hour but with time, mastering will come and so will the Recommended meaning of the controls of RE4: they are just perfect.\n\nEnemies off-screen are balanced so that their accuracy is greatly reduced so that you don't get shot or smashed from point-of-views outside of yours and everything just... fits perfectly once you get into the game. The controls are excellent after a bit with them. I hate mentioning *it* but... it's like Dark Souls: with time, perfection comes (except RE4 is better designed, fairer and just better paced).\n\nShooting feels great! The weapon variety is fantastic and the upgrades are interesting and balanced enough to make it fun and a necessity for a playthrough (or you'll take decades to kill some dudes). The level design is brilliant, varied and enjoyable to traverse and the enemy variety, as stated, is also great.\n\n[h1]TECHNICAL SIDE / PRESENTATION [/h1]\n\nThis is an HD Remaster btw: the graphics and textures were uplifted greatly. The levels and textures now pack alot more detail than they already did (crazy, right?). It now performs at 60FPS in a very fluid and well optimized manner.\n\nNow, problem is: the minimum requirements are tough to handle. On my old laptop I can play 60FPS on lowest 1024x600 res, while I can play RE5 (FIVE!) on high @ native 1366x768. RE5 still looks better than this uplifted RE4 and as such, be sure to pack a medium-range rig to run this PROPERLY in it's full spectacular HD textures option (they are very much worth it). If your PC sucks for it and can't handle 60FPS, then any framerate below will result in a game slowdown proportional to the lost frames (45FPS will slowdown less than a 20FPS experience slowdown). It's just... weird, near amateurish programming. And how they didn't fix performance for some lower-end rigs (that SHOULD run this beautifully) nor fix bugs tied with the framerate (some quicktime events are a pain in 60FPS, others are plain impossible without a workaround), is jarring to say the least.\n\nThe atmosphere in the remaster didn't change, the grim and tense feel of the environments, the excellent ambient and music cues in the environments are still present and give it a creepy vibe throughout the whole 20 hours, without being SCARY. Yes people, RE4 isn't scary. It's just creepy and eerie, but doesn't go more than that.\n\nOverall, good looking graphics (still looks good in this day and age due to a very characteristic artstyle that just makes it stand out from any other game in the genre), even more so with the HD textures turned on (you can play with the original 2004 textures and it doesn't affect the experience at all tbh). The voice acting is cheesy excellence! Really well voiced and every word spewed feels like it has the punch the writers intended it to have. The environments, the sountrack, ambient noises and overall presentation is fabulous!\n\n[h1]TL;DR (PROS and CONS)[/h1]\n\n[h1]PROS[/h1]\n+ Phenomenal atmosphere;\n+ Excellent controls (requires experimentation and time to learn);\n+ Great story with nice dialogue and funny writing;\n+ Excellently paced:\n+ Amazing enemy variety;\n+ Fantastic level design and variety in the levels themselves;\n+ Gameplay feels great thanks to good sounding weapons and responsive controls;\n+ Enemy variety is huge and every enemy is original and requires learning to adapt to its attack patterns (Garrador is still my favorite little fucker <3);\n+ Good remaster update at a good price that is worth picking up even for veterans.([spoiler]coughDarkSoulscoughBulletstormcough[/spoiler])\n\n[h1]CONS[/h1]\n- Dodgy port requirements: it doesn't look good enough to demand the rigs listed in the requirements, much less does it demand such low settings to run on medium-low end rigs that can run RE5 and RE6 far better;\n- It still has bugs, some nasty ones included (one section in a mine cart travel, you are forced to play @capped30FPS in order to pass a quicktime-event that is impossible @60FPS);\n- It ends (legit quite sad, since we'll never get an RE game this light hearted or phenomenal in design and experience).\n\n\nAnd I didn't even mention both extra campaigns, which add another 3-5 hours of extra gametime or the ridiculously hard Professional difficulty that is one of the only ones that really push a gamer to his limits.\n\nThis is a 9.5, if not even a 10/10. A Recommended masterpiece.",Recommended

"Resident Evil 4 is a third person shooter. A third person shooter with tank controls. \nNo, tank controls are great. Shut up, I like them ok!\n\nThe game is pretty difficult, sadly it tends to be way too generous with ammo. I used the pistol most of the time and usually still had at least a hundred bullets in my inventory. This isn't even counting the amount of shotgun and rifle ammo I had. This might be less of an issue on Professional difficulty, I wouldn't know as you can only select this difficulty after finishing the game.\n\nResident Evil 4 is too long and not just a bit too long. The game should've ended around the end of the castle section, the second map. It kept going for 4-5 more hours. This is luckily where the quality of the game takes a nosedive. At least the general gameplay still feels great, as such it was bearable.\n\nThe game has a lot of quick time events, these QTEs will give you a very short amount of time, this is supposedly mostly a problem when playing at 60 fps. You can avoid this issue by using the option to lock the game to 30 fps. I would recommend doing so if you're not bothered playing at a lower framerate as the QTEs can be quite frustrating, especially during boss fights and in the middle of cutscenes.\n\nAfter completing the game however there's still the dlc, the dlc they didn't even bother remastering. Extremely low quality cutscenes, some button prompts not even changed to reflect the dlc is being played using a keyboard. The dlc would've felt very cheap either way as almost all areas are reused from the main game.\n\nI would recommend playing Resident Evil 4, the game feels great to play and the story and characters are enjoyable. I don't know if I can recommend finishing it. This one's a very slight recommendation.",Recommended

"I don't recommend you get this port of the game as it crashes way too often to the point where it is just too unbearable to play the game. I had to play through the cabin and then 2 gates area in 2-3 so many goddamn times and now i cant even get past the castle opening because anytime im close to beating the barracks are in 3-1 the fucking game crashes, like it always crashes when im close to getting the key or have just got the castle key and just killed everone in the room. It feels the game fucking crashes on purpose and at certain points just to fuck with you (even though i know thats not Recommended it just feels that way). Besides that issue it still good old re4, the controls take a minute to get used to but you should get the hang of them quickly and you can change how your graphics and what your framerate is so you can have the classic look and feel of the game (GC and xbox Version). If you ask me you should turn anti-aliasing off and definitly no motion blur game seems to run faster that way even on 30 fps. I put dont reccoment because it crashes, but its still fun to play and if you think you can get over the crashing issue then i highly recommend as this game as very good and is considered by many to be the best in the series. I hope the crashing issue will fix (im on windows 10) soon (very soon at that) because i wanna be able to enjoy the game without it crashes all the damn time (at people should try to reduce it) but the devs probably dont even mess the game anymore so wishful hopeing on my part. All in all good game only play if you can get past the crashing (even a little like me).",Not Recommended

It's just non-stop monster killing and combat till your brain melts away. Some really small and unintrusive puzzles allow you to take a break sometimes too.\nThere are some small problems though; I couldn't get the game to work at all without going into its files and disabling v-sync - it wasn't an option in game, at least at the time, so if you're having trouble with performance, try looking into it online or something. Besides that, there's an specific QTE at the mining cart section that is basically impossible if you're running at 60fps, so I had to change it to 30 just for this specific part.\nStill, great game, can't go wrong with RE4.",Recommended

I also do love Resident Evil (the first one).\n\nI have to say that this is an outstanding game. It has also managed to age very well. The thing it has with the controls is weird: I wouldn't say controlling Leon is tremendously comfortable, but that kind of ""unnatural"" difficulty in handling the character definitely adds to the final product in the sense of ""anxiety"" and not being fully aware of your sorroundings.\n\nIf you haven't yet, do play this great classic.",Recommended

"I decided to give this game a shot after years of hearing that it's an AMAZING game. So I figured, why not? Maybe the game aged terribly, or I'm just not a fan of the genre, but I did not enjoy playing this game. I see a ton of people complain that the controls are weird, since you can't move and shoot at the same time, but I understand that it's to add a sense of horror. That's fine. I just found the enemies to be boring. The boss fights being the only time my interest really peaked. Leon is a piece of cardboard who makes terrible jokes the whole game. Which, is a meme in itself. Ashley isn't the worst in the world, but it adds another sense of horror and tension, which I get. The game was just not fun. The only form of gameplay the game really has is it's attempts to add tension to scare you, but it's just that. You kill the enemies in the area, move on, and repeat. The story wasn't really that interesting, although the only character I really liked throughout the game was Luis Sera.  \n  \nI'd give the game a 5/10.  \n  \n-Pros  \nLuis is cool.  \nThe few puzzles that were in the game, I enjoyed.  \nBosses were cool, although all easily beatable.  \n    \n-Cons  \nGame aged poorly.  \nEnemies are all pretty similar.  \nStory really isn't that interesting.",Not Recommended

"One of Capcom's alltime greatest. With fantastic shooting mechanics, an atmosphere that embodies the earlier RE games before they went off the rails with RE5 and beyond, and a story so cheesy it's delicious, RE4's more than worth your time and money.",Recommended
"The behind-the-shoulder shooter style really helped Resident Evil 4. People complained about the awful camera in previous games. I never played those games, but I have seen the old video reviews and written complaints from years back. This camer type solves all major issues with that. In addition, the level design is good, even when challenging. The game has plenty of neat guns to try out, and can get very fun. I must compare the first time I played this game to the first time I played Dark Souls 1, due to the rush of fear and wonder when I first came upon a new boss.\n\nThe HD textures are not well implemented when I played it.\nRE4 lags on par with the previously mentioned Dark Souls 1 in Blighttown at times. It may not be as fully bad as Blighttown in DS1, but it happens during the story moments when it rains and such. At least, it did for me.\n\nDespite the lag issue, it's still a great game, and should be acknowledged as such.",Recommended

It has a nice variety of weapons to use against your enemies, and also a kick which can be used to knock enemies down, making them easier to finish off.\nA part of the game has you defending a girl named Ashley. Defending her can be a bit tedious at times, but it only becomes a bigger problem if you rush into things without thinking.\n\n\nGRAPHICS\nI had the HD textures on, and it looks pretty good aside from a few textures that look obviously dated, but nothing that hindered my experience.\n\n\nSUMMARY\nRE4 is a great game despite its flaws. 8/10 - ""I knew you'd be fine if you landed on your butt.""",Recommended

If you must play it, stick with a controller.\n\nIt'll make QTE's more intuitive than seemingly pulling out the X and C ke's randomly, when they have no other use in the game. It'll also, counterintuitivel, make aiming easier, as the camera is less likely to flip out at the merest nudge.",Not Recommended
"Great game with an enjoyable story and cheesy dialogue.\nIf you like Resident Evil, you'll most likely enjoy this entry even if it drops the horror as a genre and uses it as a theme instead.\n\nEDIT: This port IS prone to crashing, although this has only happened to me twice and it was when I tried exiting to the main menu. Carry on.\n\n\nIt's not my favorite in the franchise as it does some things I'm not a fan of, however. Since most people focus on the positives and I agree with them, I'll just give a few cons I have with the game.\n\n-QTEs while more lenient than the later 2 games, are still a pain in the ass. There's even a fight (I won't spoil) in which, even if you succeed in the QTE, Leon will sometimes get hit by the attack anyway making it moot.\n-Even for OTS, the controls can be finicky and downright annoying at times. I'm used to tank controls, but that isn't to say a different control style can't be bothersome. Sometimes opening a door with someone in a blindspot, usually ends up on a free hit even when you know it's coming due to the fact you simply just don't turn very fast. Annoying, but not THAT big of an issue most of the time.\n-Ashley, while better than most other escort quests, is still an escort quest and can get in the way or be dumb sometimes. I threw a grenade at a pack of cultists 10 feet away from me. She's usually on my ass the whole time, but decided to crouch near them instead and dies. Why.\n-The last section of the game after the castle, is honestly underwhelming. The Village and Castle were great, but at that point I just wanted it to be over. It definitely brought the game down a bit imo.\n\nThat's all for now, but with that out of the way, I highly recommend this game if you're new to the franchise or even if you're already a fan. It's got maybe 1 enemy that's actually unnerving, but, just don't expect it to be a ""horror"" game.",Recommended

"Cannot be denied that Resident Evil 4 is one of the greatest Action Video Games of all time! Long and gone was Survival Horror removed from this point in the Resident Evil Franchise. But what has been added instead was a heavy focus on Action to keep the player on their toes, Quick Time Events, and a Story that can be compared to some of the old 1980's Action and even Horror flicks. \n\nWhat has been added in this particular version of Resident Evil 4 is updated resolutions, options to have HD Textures and even the Original Textures, 30 and 60 FPS mode, and this being a PC Game there is options to use a Controller (preferably 360 or XBO) or Keyboard and Mouse. \n\nIs it worth coming back to Resident Evil 4 on the PC this time around? Yes, I most certainly say because this is the definitive release of Resident Evil 4 to date! \n\nHowever I do want to make a note about the side campaign for this game called Seperate Ways which you can unlock by just beating the game. The cutscenes are really bad, outstretched pre-rendered cutscenes to be exact that are really hard to look at in high resolutions like in 1080p. I do not have an exact clarification on this, but it does make sense to what I am about to say. Seperate Ways was exclusively made for the PS2 Port for Resident Evil 4 and the bonus content/base content present in the PS2 Version was later used for the basis of future ports. Resident Evil 4 on the PS2 did not originally have in-game rendered cutscenes unlike in the original GameCube, meaning even Seperate Ways brand new cutscenes were pre-rendered originally as well. Assests were probably more then likely never saved so we are stuck with the PS2 Quality pre-rendered cutscenes, just though I'd talk about it for those that might have a concern seeing this from playing it before or didn't know about this.\n\nAlthough if you somehow don't like the look of the game there is a project being worked on called Resident Evil 4 HD Project. It is a mod that completely revamp the textures to higher resolutions while keeping the assests intact close to what was originally seen since the GameCube.

RE4 changed a lot over the years as it was released across multiple consoles, but I was always stuck with my trusty GameCube version. Now, a decade has passed, and I'm able to revisit this classic again, in stunning form. The HD update makes the game very visually pleasing, and the gameplay itself is exactly as I remember it.\n\nSince some have mentioned glitches and bugs, I'll say that for me, the game has run as smooth as silk. \n\nRE4 HD gets a 10/10 from me.",Recommended

"Could have been a masterpiece!..... if not for the mandatory escort that fills at least half of the game....

"I'v always heard great things about this game and had to try it out for myself, whilst it has aged awfully in terms of controls/graphics etc etc it's still very playable. Theres alot more inventory management in this game than i thought there would be but nothing too stressful, I like the over the shoulder camera view but aiming in this game isn't very fun lol. \n\nThe atmosphere and panic this game can create truly surprised me, I found myself having to manage my ammo and inventory carefully so I could make sure I always had ammo or items to face any situation so great ++ for that. The games pacing and storyline is structured quite well and I never got bored, a great classic I'm glad I checked out :)",Recommended

Played through it on ps2, gamecube, wii, and pc.\n\nI think this is a pretty good port, and I would honestly recommend using a controller simply because that's what the game was originally designed to be played with. \n\nThe mouse/keyboard controls are great, but honestly almost make aiming too easy, but be warned: the controls for controller will feel clunky and dated, and will take some getting used to, but once you do it will be no problem.",Recommended

"Honestly, I never thought I would ever enjoy a Resident Evil game, let alone enjoy it as much as I did. I can understand why so many people love this game and now it sits at the top of my list of favorite video games of all time. This game is so much more than a stereotypical horror game.\n\n\nTL;DR: The atmosphere and charm that this games gives off is worth every penny you pay for it. A perfect mixture of suspense, action and horror lead to a game with an awesome protagonist, setting and pace. Don't let a single negative review discourage you from experiencing this game!\n\n\n+ The atmosphere of this game is delightful and horrifying all at the same time. So many little details are scattered throughout the world and the scenery feels believable and immersive. From the creepy and arid village, the beautiful French castle and the cramped research island, this game crams so much detail into the scenery that nearly every part of the game feels memorable. For most of the game, you are alone and way outnumbered, and something about that feeling keeps you on edge the whole game but with little pauses in between. A big breath in, a big breath out. \n\n\n+ I have never played a game with pacing that was as perfect as RE4. When you complete the game for the first time, you will look at the amount of time you've played on steam and think ""Only -- hours? I could've sworn I played this a lot longer!"" Every part of the map feels significant and the game has a rhythm to it that feels just right. You might mow through countless enemies in one room and move to the next to be greeted by the familiar merchant and a save station, devoid of any enemies. It feels like going on a roller coaster where there are ups and downs, but never too long of an up or too long of a down. The action is constant and the game does an excellent job at making you feel suspense. I would say that the game really is half an action shooter and half a horror survival. RE4 Certainly puts action and pacing at the top of the priority list and it pays off. You won't find yourself getting stuck too often because the games tweaks the difficulty ever so slightly to accommodate the player's level of skill. Puzzles never feel too complicated and nothing gets in the way. Whatever they did to get such perfect pacing worked brilliantly. \n\n\n+ While only a handful of themes are memorable, the background noises and ambiance really add a whole level to the atmosphere of the game. The music score is used more as a smart guideline to indicate when enemies are near, when you are in danger or when you should keep your guard up. There are points in the game where everything completely goes silent to alert the player and this is somehow even spookier than the eerie background music. I absolutely love that safe places like save spots are backed with a more pleasant soundtrack to make the player aware that you finally have some time to take a deep breath. \n\n\n+ Sound effects are excellent, the ticking through the menus sounds satisfying, the constant chanting of the cultists and the terrifying breathing of some of the games creepier enemies all leave a good impression on you. Again, the sound designers did a really good job integrating the sounds along with the game play. A good example is when there are enemies in a room but you cannot see them, you can still hear their chains from their weapons rattle, notifying you to keep your guard up. \n\n\n+ This specific port sometimes gets heat for its controls, but I think they are very intuitive and MILES ahead of the franchise's previous installments. I certainly think the controls are something you will feel mildly uncomfortable with at first, but as you get better weapons and the enemies get harder to dispatch, your control over Leon S. Kennedy also evolves. I personally got used to them quickly and I fell in love with the aiming, reloading and the inventory system. DO NOT let complaints about crappy controls deter you from this game. It's just like any other game, you pick it up not knowing what you're doing and eventually get smoother and snappier.\n\n\n+ I love the settings, dialogue and feel of the characters and villains. It's almost like a time capsule from the early 2000's  and something feels mildly nostalgic about it. Leon Kennedy is the dopest American action hero written into a horror story and man, you really feel the awesomeness the whole way. in contrast to a lot of other horror games where you are a helpless chicken running from a threat, the president straight up sent you in to rescue his daughter from a cult of terrible monsters and conniving terrorists... alone. The dialogue is absolutely the cheesiest thing you will hear for a long time, but instead of being an annoyance, it actually has a charm to it. The bad guy is always one step ahead of Leon, making the moment when you catch up feel like you've done something substantial. I would say that you only get this kind of charming goofy dialogue from a Japanese studio.\n\n\n+ Props to Capcom for managing to include a follower AI that didn't suck. Ashley ducks down when you are aiming, stays in place when you tell her to and alerts you when she is being harmed. She is just complex enough to do what you need her to do but simple enough to where she doesn't become a multitasking nightmare. \n\n\n\n+ Inventory system felt buttery smooth and let you customize where you wanted your items to be. Switching guns require you to pause and get it out of your inventory. Eventually, you get so fast at this that you no longer think about it. It allows you to pause the action to select the right weapon and come up with a strategy to defeat your enemies. Do you pull out a sub-machine gun to mow down the horde, or a grenade? A rifle to get a precise shot or a shotgun to blow the enemy out of your way?\n\n\n+ Upgrade system was a such a fun part of the game. The feeling of getting stronger as you move on is only met with more terrifying enemies, so getting that new shiny shotgun feels like a breath of fresh air. \n\n\n+ Bosses were memorable and unique\n\n\n+ Replayability is excellent, as playing through the story once will leave you with a strong desire to play more. Good news, extra unlocks and difficulty are available after you beat the game for the first time. Extra game modes are included where you play as a variety of other characters from the game.",Recommended

"The perfect hybrid Resident Evil evil game. A well balanced blend between classic RE and more modern RE playstyle and mechanics. Before Resident Evil 7 came out, this was the last great Resident Evil game to come out in over a decade. I absolutely love this game, the adrenaline and tension you can feel at times is exhilarating. This game also brings me back to the good ol' days when there was no DLC and games even had secret unlockable modes and extra content included in the final product. Sure a few games still do it but it's getting more and more rare by the day. IMO, this game is a timeless classic that if given the chance, can still be appreciated today.",Recommended

One of the best RE titles that introduced the 3rd person / over the shoulder style and QTE events\n\nThis is the make it or break it for some people but Recommended fans will appreciate its art\n\nThis is another masterpiece from the PS2 era and the remaster on PC is so much better\n\nThe depth of this game and atmosphere is what brings me back to this,Recommended
"This is my favorite game of all time.\n\nI've played 3 versions of this game: Wii, PC (old), and Steam.  I think the Wii version is my favorite, and I've spent the most time on that one.  I was super excited when I saw this version coming out, becuase the original PC version sucks.  This has great graphics, and can run constantly at 60 FPS if your PC is powerful enough (if your PC isn't that powerful, you can still run it at 60 FPS, but you'll get some framerate drops when grenades explode or stuff like that).  What's more, this adds keyboard and mouse control to the game, which the original PC version lacks.  I think the only place that's kinda hard to use the mouse is during the first boss of the game.  Anyway, it's definitely worth buying this version even if you already have this amazing game on other platforms.\n\n11 years ago, I got the Wii version.  I was just a little kid then, and this was too scary to me.  I got to chapter 1-2, and had no progression for quite a long time.  5 years later, I decided to pick up this game and try to beat it, and I did.  I witnessed how a masterpiece could be.  This has become my favorite piece of art since then.  This is not an ordinary prince-saving-princess type of story.  There's much more in it.  I don't wanna spoil it for you guys, so you can experience it by yourself.  The gameplay is just as good as you can imagine for 2005.  There are some pretty memorable bosses and moments, and the weapon upgrade system is the best in the series.  Also, do you know that this is the revolution of modern TPS games?  The over-the-shoulder aiming camera comes from this game!\n\nI can spend ages talking about this game, but I'm gonna end it here.  Shout-out to Xelger, who had my favorite Let's Play series of this game on YouTube.  I've played this game for so long, but I've never practiced speedrunning this game.  That's my next goal.  If you've read this until here, I really appreciate it.  Buy it if you don't have this game yet, or go ahead and play this again if you've beat it before.  You'll never get tired of experiencing such a great work of art.",Recommended

"I don't care how jingoistic this sounds: this is my favourite game of all time. The game mechanics are so simple and refined but also present the player with tonnes of options that results in satisfying combat that never gets old. The capaign is meticulously well paced and constantly shaking things up with each scenario being more insane than the last. It's linear in its design but it takes you through atmospheric, memerable locales that are dense with light puzzles and things hidden in many of their nooks and crannies; it's very Metroid-like in its world design. The story is a simple yet thoroughly, utterly ridiculous tale populated with camp and cheesy but likable characters. The inventory system is just plain awesome, the music is brilliant and haunting, the artstyle of the world around you is beautiful and holds up really well today, the weapon upgrade system and the simple in-game economy that supports it is very rewarding, it doesn't baby you and throws you straight into the deep end, its difficulty is just right, it perfectly blends horror and action, it's got great replay value, it has an awesome extra mode called ""The Mercenaries"" as well as a full separate campaign played through with another character, etc., etc. I could go on. I love it. It's so good. It's so fucking good.\n\nWill say though: use a gamepad. Keyboard controls suck for this game. And if you're not used to older shooters the tank-esque controls might be jarring at first but they're so simple that you should get used to them within minutes.",Recommended

"Wow, what a monumental let down this was! First played this years ago on the Wii, it was a great game. saw it had been released on PC on Steam as this HD version which is meant to be a good port, but it really isn't! First, after a series of problems trying to get the game to run (it crashed to desktop several times and then wouldn't load games, turns out it didn't like running at 60fps, reduced to 30fps in game settings and it was ok).\n\nAfter finally getting into a game, that's when the real disappointment started. Absolutely horrible to control! You are zoomed in very close to your character, who blocks a lot of your view. There is no mouse look, you can only turn with the keyboard keys (WASD), the aiming is very clunky and inaccurate. Just trying to move about or shoot anything is very awkward and difficult. And the sound.. don't get me started on that, just walking around is fine, but when something happens the sound turns laggy and breaks up, which is very annoying to listen to.\n\nI'm going to search for some mods to try and improve the game, but I'm not hopeful. I only paid about £6 for the game, but it's still a waste of money.",Not Recommended

They feel extremely floaty, imprecise, disorienting and tedious. Honestly, though, the gameplay makes up for this as you get used to them while playing.",Recommended
"Great game up until the start of chapter 5, where suddenly everything is thrown at you all at once.. \nConstantly out of ammo/low on ammo, low on herbs or completely out of healing items, and the nonstop enemy spam.. Sweet jesus.\nHad to push on through the last few levels because at this point, the incremental increase in difficulty was thrown out the window and upped by about 300%. Absolutely ridiculous. You'll HAVE to completely max out the last pistol and shotgun you are able to get because without them, you just won't beat this game.\n\nAiming and movement is hard to get used to, even if you've played RE5. Choppy as f and most of the times you are in tight areas where being able to move freely is mandatory. \n\nFramerates leave much to be desired, i'm running it on a gtx1060 6gb with an i7 and even with everything turned off and on the lowest settings, it would start FPS lagging for no reason, even in areas with barely anything in it. \n\nI would still recommend it because it's a great game with a solid story, but damn..",Recommended
"I'm glad I took the time to finish this one. There's a lot of fun little things hidden under the surface here. From the goofy over the top action veneer of the cast to the grimy setting and muddy graphics. There's a bit of an investment with the controls, as they take a bit of time to get used to. But by the time end game rolled around, I was popping heads with the best of them.\n\nEverything just seems so out of place. The character you control, Leon, will spit goofy action quips at bosses, all the while remaining completely unfazed by giant deformed abominations, and mowing down droves of the infected. It's like a B-movie action script was shot on a horror set and everyone played it completely straight. It's magical.\n\nThe game hits you with the scariest area right off the bat. From there, I settled into this drone of complacency with the game. I, just like Leon, came face to face with some of the ugliest monsters this side of fiction. The only thought going through my head was, ""So, that's it?""\n\nMy inventory swelled and shrunk with items as I ambled through the levels. I bought additional weaponry, upgraded them, and went along my way. Occasionally, there would be puzzles thrown in my way, but those would be basic at best, and would only really require a bit of fiddling. There's a good amount of QTE, and it can be distracting, but I don't find it harmful to the experience. Also, at points, there's an odd political subtext, which is distracting, but I guess that's just what Japan does sometimes. Hardly a deal breaker.\n\nThis game is a masterpiece of horror, if for no other reason than it doesn't take itself too seriously. A lesson a LOT of games could stand to learn.\n",Recommended

"[h1]This is not a resident evil game[/h1]\nBut rather, a drawn out, repetitive shooter game that, from my view, is in no way impresive as a game, and was only popular due to the franchises previous success as the result of innovative thinking and story telling. \nIf you've never played a resident evil game before, do not start with this one. [b] If you played it as a kid and love the nostalgia then whatever it's a different game to you, but as a new player just don't bother.[/b] Not only is the port terrible, the game itself is the most painful, cringeworthy disaster to exist:\n[list]\n    [*]Camera angle and FOV is the worst I've ever seen in a game, the slow controls and sensitivity make manuvering a chore. The classic camera angle views from the first few resident evil games (the good ones) have been replace in favor of the terrible over-the-shoulder shooter mechanic that makes general gameplay difficult. \n\n    [*]Enemies AI is unchallenging and boring from start to finish. ""Boss fights"" can quickly be ploughed through with the use of an RPG, and enemies in general don't pose any form of challenge or horror element, and each one is simply a reskin of the other. The only challenge throughout the games combat is attempting to not let the disastorous control scheme get you killed by been incredibly slow.\n\n    [*]Horror doesn't exist in this game. By Odin's thunder this is not a [i]""Survival Horror""[/i], but rather several hours of constantly shooting boring enemies (which sponge an unreasonable amount of ammunition), paired alongside a ""story"" that could of been writen by an 8 year old child in the space of 20 minutes.\n\n    [*]There is no tension throughout the entire game. The old save system is implemented, despite the fact that checkpoints exist before every room of the game, and loadable saves are granted after the completion of a chapter of the game. Dying serves no penalty whatsoever and as a result classic Resident Evil combat just doesnt exist, removing the largest source of tension and fear from the originals. \n\n    [*]The port in general is bad, controls are disgustingly clunky, even with a controller, lagspike are constant and can slow the game down even further.\n\n    [*]The shop feature allows you to buy weapons and items, removing most of the scavenging feature of the previous games. There's just your typical teleporting weapons dealer with an arsenal inventory similar to the kind found in flash games. Generally immersion breaking, though you could argue it's not a very immersive game to begin with. Don't even get me started on this currency system to buy things.\n\n    [*]Characters feel like poorly written child cartoons and are cringeworthy and shallow in comparison to literally every single resident evil character to date.

Weapon upgrading allows you to improve weapons, and you can carry a fairly large range of weapons with you as you traverse the game, which can make comabt more interesting. \n\n[*] Inventory managment has been tweaked slightly, and is a good improvment on previous resident evil games, and can make gathering loot more interesting.\n\n[*]Some enemies can be quite impressive, and can make for good boss fights and enjoyably tough gameplay challenges at times, though certain enemies can quickly become reused and dumped back into the pile of enemies you'll see constantly.  \n\n[*]Range of environments as the game progresses can make for some different combat engagements, making use of different cover and areas, and making the game look a little less repetitive.\n[/list]\nGenerally, from a critical point of view I think this game is pretty awful, even at release I didn't really enjoy it, and moved onto other PS2 games at the time. \n[b]But if you're someone who enjoyed it at its original release then the nostalgia is there, and you should go buy it and enjoy it. If you've never played a resident evil game before, dont start here. [/b] \nThe original Resident Evil/ Biohazard remake is a better place to start, unless the constant gunplay of 4-6 are more appealing, then start there.

"Fun when it came out over a decade ago, and still fun today. Satisfying gameplay, silly story, and Amazing Voice Acting. Game has stood the test of time. I've played it dozens of times and have owned every version. Has a decent length for a single player game already, and on top of that the replayablilty is high, lots of things to unlock.

This game is filled with tedium and boredom, and I cannot imagine anyone saying it is good if they have played Half Life 1 or System Shock 2, which are both pretty much survival horror, came out more than 5 years before this game, and are better in EVERY SINGLE FUCKING WAY. This is the ultimate console pleb game, and this is proven by the fact that no one makes games like this anymore. Also this is a really crappy port. No key mapping, bizzare mouse acceleration, low res texures all over the place. Capcom sucks.",Not Recommended

BUT some fag policemen leave you be and you have to learn Spanish. This game serves a great educational value when it comes to learning languages. Leon Spenis can use a lot of different guns, the factually most op one being the Punisher handgun. Guns make you feel good when shooting at villagers while learning Spanish.

"RE 4 was awesome back in 2005, and it's still a whole lot of fun 13 years later. There would be no Gears Of War / Dead Space / Uncharted  etc without this game.\n\nEvery single one of those titles was undoubtedly IMO inspired by RE 4. Take the best 3rd person action orientated shooter prior to it's release (pc owners would probably say Max Payne, or maybe Psi Ops) and it will have one gameplay mechanic, one cool little touch, that it just repeats over and over. Max Payne would be a prime example of this - fun? sure, one note in its execution? yup.\n\nThen Capcom came along and said ""hey! you know what's good? cracking action. But do you know what's even better? Having cracking action AND variety! And sexy boss battles! And Intense setpieces! Keep mixing up those things, and top it off with super stylish cutscenes that western folk seem to have no comprehension of how to execute, and voila!!!!""\n\n(or whatever the japanese equivalent of voila is)\n\nHonestly - having all those elements in one game, it just didn't exist before RE4. Other developers had access to the same level of technology, but Capcom had the craft, resources and ambition that they lacked. Perhaps most importantly they didn't care how daft an idea is (the game is daft...) as long as its fun.\n\nThe combat is punchy, challenging and well paced. There's always a little something around the corner spicing it up - a new enemy that requires a change in tactics, or a mild puzzle, or a boss battle / exciting setpiece / cinematic QTE. In terms of how it flows and engages the player this is a perfect game.\n\nThat's why 13 years later this is still doing the rounds, whilst most of its contemporaries from that time are dead and buried...Not even its slightly shonky outdated control scheme can kill its magnificence, and with a HD mod applied it still looks decent too. \n\nI dunno about Capcoms own HD effort - my version was just the vanilla port, and to be honest in 2018 it looked ropey... \n\nBut as a game I thought it was superb back in 2005, and its still how I feel about it now.",Recommended

"This game is allot of fun, at times it has difficulty spikes but on normal mode it's diffucult enough to not feel easy but no so hard it gets annoying. if you're looking at this game for the puzzles don't even try it. the puzzles are as easy as taking two things and switching their placment. the combat is sorta clunky so i'd recomend playing with a remote when you shoot you can't move and there are tank controlls. if you don't adjust well to odd controlls this game isn't good for you.\n\n the story and characters are likable and fun even though they're pretty shallow. the combat is pretty fun and is the main thing you'll be doing.  it has allot of controll flaws but makes up for it in the fun you'll have once you master them.  you might here how this game is a annoying cause you need to have a young girl follow you the whole time and well you do need to have the young girl with you she's very well programmed so that she doesn't get in the way, i've only had about 7 ""game over""'s because of her in my 24 hours of playing as of now.\n\nthe game looks great for PS2 era very good character models and the voice acting is on par. \n\nthe second boss in the game is crazy hard prob the hardest in the game so don't feel bad if it takes you awhile to beat him. it took me 16 hours to beat the game normally. i'd rate it a 6/10 nothing amazing but allot of fun. for me an 5 is avarage just so you know.",Recommended

This game gives you a lot of freedom, even though it is not a open world game. There is a lot to explore, a lot of ways to fight the bosses and a lot of secrets to be discovered. The boss battles are very good and the story is also good, has a few plots and twist. Even though it is not as enjoyable as it would've been in 2005 it is still one of the best horror games. Totally recommended.",Recommended

Use a controller to spare yourself a lot of headaches.",Recommended
"After fixing up some issues, and by which I mean I wasn't hooked up to my graphics card XD the game runs just fine. Now for those who are running into some major issues, here are some things to take into consideration. Are you meeting the bare minimum requirements for the game to run properly? Also are you using a graphics card to help out with the gaming? If not you may not be happy with your results. It seriously shouldn't be this hard to play a very outdated game, but thats just how the cookie crumbles. Now on to my review. \n\nResident Evil 4 is probably one of the best resident evil games out there. It wasn't to heavy on action button sequences, but believe me when I say Resident evil 6 is a fiasco of button sequence reactions. This game was pretty darn fun back in the day. Still is today if you can have it play properly on your computer. The controls are great, and the game is relying on good story, and gameplay. It may take you awhile to get the hang of everything but once you know how to play you'll be having a grand time shooting up the towns folk and saving Ashley.  If you get the chance try this game out, and see if it tickles your fancy. Word to the wise who have never played this game, do not, I REPEAT do not try to grab the shotgun in the begining of the game, unless you want to crap yourself trying to fight off a chainsaw monster XD",Recommended
This classic third person action with variety of environment setting will make one of very enjoyable experience throughout the game.,Recommended
"It was pretty fun. I was kind of scared/overwhelmed at first, but as you progress through the game, you'll feel invincible. Pretty fun, despite Ashley's existence.",Recommended
"I prefer online multiplayer games, to a fault.  There are more games out there than I care to admit, that I've played, where I've simply ignored the single-player story and only jumped online for gameplay.  It's just who I am, for better or worse.  Therefore, it's a testament to Resident Evil 4 that I have this amount of playtime on it, despite not having an online mode.  This game is so good, it breaks my worst habit as a gamer.  With that in mind, Resident Evil 4 is simply one of the best games I've played.\n\nThe premise is simple: stop a cult from doing evil things while saving the girl, and surviving along the way.  However, it's how this story is presented that gives Resident Evil 4 its charm.  The plot is ridiculous, the jokes are usually groan-worthy, Leon isn't witty at all, Ashley is useless, the dialogue is corny, and so on and on -- but I LOVE IT.  Resident Evil 4 strikes an absolutely perfect balance between taking itself seriously, but intentionally not too seriously.  This creates such a charisma that not only kept me playing until the end of the game, but keeps me coming back to play it even after several playthroughs.  This is helped through other aspects of the game, too.\n\nThe pacing in Resident Evil 4 is perfect.  The environments, even in the same area, are always changing to keep up with the progression of the player, so the game always feels fresh and new.  To complement that, there are a huge variety of enemies in this game.  Even when enemies are reused, they're done so in a way in a different area that requires a change in strategy to beat them.  The boss fights are equally as rewarding, as well.  Along with this, there's a weapon levelling system in place that perfectly paces with the game that not only keeps the game fun throughout, but encorages multiple playthroughs.  The ammo count is limited enough where this still feels enough like survival horror, but plentiful enough where the player isn't screwed at any point in the game.  The story is quite lengthy, too, but Resident Evil 4 never feels boring or repetitive -- even after multiple playthroughs.  It's always a joy to play through this game.\n\nThe one thing that seems to possibly frustrate players, judging by the reviews on here, are the controls.  However, I feel like most the people complaining about the controls in RE4 are related to Timmy No Thumbs.  The aiming is precise enough where the player can stagger enemies how they want and dispose of them with ease.  Keeping in mind that RE4 is a [u]survival horror[/u] game, however, the player is still vulnerable where there isn't a sense of invincibility.  This extends to the camera, in which I've seen people complain about not seeing the enemies well enough because they can't turn fast enough.  Not only are they not using the 180° feature, but they're also not using their audio well enough to listen for incoming enemies.  The only criticism I've seen with the controls that's actually valid are a couple of the QTEs at 60fps -- they're faster than intended.  However, even that issue is a bit overstated, and I've personally never had a problem with it.  The controls are fine, albeit it's better with a controller.\n\nBesides the QTE quirk, the port for Resident Evil 4 is good, considering this game was originally on the Gamecube in 2005.  The game runs at a rock-solid 60fps, and out of the myriad of playthroughs I've done, I've only seen RE4 crash twice -- both on Windows 10.  The graphics are good, with resolutions up to 1920x1080.  The textures are admittedly a bit dated in 2018, although a huge texture mod is in progress and should overhaul that significantly.  The sounds are also nice, especially with a headset, that allow the player to know about incoming enemies and from which direction.  The music fits perfectly with whatever mood the game presents.  In all, the PC port needs to do one job -- not detract from the brillance of Resident Evil 4 as a game.  It does the job well enough.\n\nThat brilliance of Resident Evil 4 is how everything is wrapped together into the complete single-player classic.  Not only is the game fun to play, it's just simply a fun experience.  Even the game's extras add an extra element to the game that is worth playing through at least once.  The difficulty level of Resident Evil 4 is very well balanced in both Normal and Professional difficulties.  RE4 also does a great job of mixing up action sequences with puzzles, boss fights, and so on.  Even the escort portions of the game aren't around enough to become an annoyance.  At first playthrough, it will likely take around 15-16 hours to beat, including several more hours' worth of extras.  Combine that with its fun story, great environments, satisfying gunplay, and so forth -- Resident Evil 4 becomes the amazing game that it is.\n\nI can't recommend Resident Evil 4 enough.  It's such an excellent game that it constantly pulls me aside from doing what I usually do in videogames.  Especially if you haven't played Resident Evil 4 yet, do yourself a favor and play an absolute classic.  Resident Evil 4 is just an awesome game, even in 2018.  Personally, this is an example of how games are so much fun, and one of the best videogames ever made.",Recommended
"Non Resident Evil fans, this is a good game regardless of how you feel about the other games in the series. You need to know in advance that this game is a series of dumb scenarios, the game knows this, and it's ready to have fun with that. Mechanically, it's the boilerplate for every action game of late 2000s, for better or for worse. The port has issues, like the QTEs not handing high framerates well. But, it's a fun(ny) ride that's worth seeing.",Recommended

The combat mechanics and enemy design are amazing, the scenarios are varied and well crafted to the mechanics, and the progression of player power makes it satisfying to replay over and over.

This is a shooter that is balanced to a controller and I actually enjoy playing it with a controller over a mouse, which is exceedingly rare since I prefer mouse and keyboard, so it is worth adjusting to if you'd like the comfort of a controller. The controls take some getting used to, but the game is built around them so I guarantee that you will have options during combat and that it isn't just unfair. Also, after you've adjusted to the controls make sure you learn how to quick turn since it is less self explanatory than the other controls. Just look in a direction with the right stick and then aim, you've quick turned and you have every movement option you need.\n\nIf you want to play a shooter with a horror overtone to it, you can't do better.",Recommended

"On the other hand, we Resident Evil 4.  I own this game for Gamecube.  At the time, it was a modern masterpiece.  Completly reworked for the 32 bit era and part of a joint alliance between Nintendo and Capcom,  It reworked many of the cons of the previous 3 entries:  no storage containers, more space, drop unwanted items, more ammunition, and even a vendor.  It has a much more arcade feel which makes exploring a lot less painfull.  The plot is solid.  Finally getting past the events of Raccoon City answering those year long questions of ""what's next?""  Basically, no zombies only the mysterious Los Illuminados, and not much asking ""why was I doing this""?  If you have never played any Resident Evil this is a good place to start.  Then later, you can appreciate the dificulty of prior entries, which have also been high definitioned of remastered.\n\nYou deserve it to play it.  Now in high definition for modern display.",Recommended
"Fucking awful aiming controls. I understand the tank controls, i've played this game a long time ago on the wii which was pretty much flawless and similar to what SHOULD have been the PC version. Why is it not? Why am I forced to use a controller? While aiming, the laser moves at a snail pace and it's very imprecise. I could barely make it to the goddamn dog (which if you've played this game, it's a total of FOUR enemies) before i had to stop playing. Not to mention that while walking, your camera will move and position itself in odd angles unless you leave the mouse completely stationary. RE4 is a great game, but I cannot recommend this port at all. You'll have more fun playing the Wii version.  And before anyone says ""use a controller"", fuck off. Bad ports are unacceptable and they are the main reason PC gaming isn't taken seriously by other consumers.",Not Recommended
"Great game, at least an 8/10, but whoever did the port did a crappy job.\nThere is a section later in the game that is literally unbeatable at 60fps.\nTo fix this you have to quit to main menu, change to 30FPS, get past the QTE, then switch back.\nHonestly Capcom, this is f**king pathetic, and the fact that this was never fixed is absolutely disgraceful.",Not Recommended

"First off, let me just say how much I love this game. I remember back in 2005-2006 my preteen self saved up a bit of lunch money to buy this game on the Gamecube for me and my nephew. I bought it because i remember my kid self played a little bit of resident evil 1 on the N64, and resident evil 2 on the original playstation in which both games scared the ever lasting hell out of me, but enjoyed very much. But i couldnt understand them enough because i was just a stupid kid at the time and didnt have strong thinking skills for puzzles or back tracking. Jump forward to this game i heard a lot of great things about it, and wanted to give it a try since i had a better understanding about games and wanted my nephew to experience what resident evil was all about. And once i popped Resi 4 into the GC, it was a anxiety induced addicting nightmare. After a small bit of dialogue to get you into the story and a firm understanding about whats going on in the world, they put you right into the game. After a couple of minutes trying to get to know the controls, they put you on the spot for combat. Once you've went through that crazy mess of a level, you think to yourself ""woah, that was just the first level"" Then to make matters worse, the next area (the village) They have you go into a village being chased by hordes of enemies kicking your butt, and one of them happens to be a chainsaw wielding maniac that can take you out in one swipe. If its your first time playing, chances are you're gonna die a lot on this part. Dr Salvador (the chainsaw guy) is ruthless and doesnt shy away from killing you unlike the other chainsaw wielding maniacs in future RE titles.\n\nThis game has very strong first impressions, and gets better with each chapter and area with its own unique characters, special infected, and bosses. The Atmosphere is very nice for what it is, the optimization is great, and the cheesy one liners Leon has to offer gives you that sense of comical relief within a game such as this.\n\nI have to say though, it feels as though the Gamecube version of RE4 a little bit harder than the future versions of it, including PC version. But that doesn't bother me as much because some enemies took up way too many bullets before finally dying during in the GC version.\n\nThe only problem i personally have with this game is its stiff controls. They havent really aged too well, but in a sense it works with this game. theres way more pros than there are cons\n\nOverall this is a great game to start off within the series if you plan on getting into Resident Evil. Resident evil is quite an amazing series and i cannot recommend Resident Evil 4 enough.\n\nI have to give this game a 8.5/10",Recommended
"Resident Evil 4 is a classic. If you don't know that, then you really don't play many games, and that's okay, but you deserve to play this game. The game came out 14 years ago and still holds extremely well, and even the character models aren't horrible by today's standards. The gunplay is satisfying and has a decent amount of variety, the unlockables for New Game+ are fun and worth getting, the bosses are memorable, the ""lock yourself into place in order to aim"" control style really gives the game a sense of urgency in combat situations and can make even the twitchiest shooter fan feel vulnerable, and the story has just enough of that campy cheese to come across as a sort of elbow-nudging parody, rather than a super serious game about the dangers of bio-terrorism, like every other Resident Evil game. Like I said, the game is a classic, but that doesn't mean that the game is spotless, 14 years later. Therefore, rather than giving RE4 a tonguebath like everyone has been doing since 2004, this is a list of small potatoes that marr and otherwise perfect game. \n\nBuy it, you won't regret it, here's the Cliff's Notes of badness.\n\nThe quick-time events that were so fresh and original on the original Gamecube are horrible. They're terribly implemented ""press X to not die"" events that randomly show up during cutscenes for no reason, other than to add some action into slow scenes. They were annoying on consoles, but on PCs, without a controller, try rapidly tapping X and then suddenly hitting both mouse buttons with a half of a second to react, and if not, you have to do it again. It's atrocious game design that was kind of experimental and interesting for the time, but really, it doesn't need to be there, and it find it hurting my hands rather than engrossing me in the game. Even worse, a lot of these events take place right before or right after boss fights. The game is nice enough to not dump you back to your save point most of the time (sometimes even just dropping you right back into the quick time event to try again), but that makes the fact that they're there even more jarring and confusing.\n\nThe camera can be an a huge ass. It's directly behind Leon's back, over his shoulder. This is usually fine, but in tight corridors, it can jam the camera even closer and make it impossible to see what's going on. For bonus points, you usually fight monsters that kill in one or two hits in closer quarters, so I found that frustrating, especially on the higher difficulty mode.\n\nThe dialogue, while having more than the recommend amount of B-Movie cheese, is HORRIBLE. ""I died in the crash two years ago, is that what they told you?"", says a new character that has never been seen before this appearance in any other game. ""You may be able to prolong your life, but it's not like you can escape your inevitable death, is it?"" says a boss character, shortly after Leon escapes. It's enough to make you cringe. Maybe a bad translation, but a lot of the voice acting really isn't much better, making a bad script seem worse. The main cast does a good enough job, but side characters are barely the level of middle school play.\n\nThe puzzles, for the most part, are either so simple that you'll roll your eyes at the solution, or take so long that the flow of the game comes to a screeching halt. Easiest way to put it: You'll be looking for a LOT of keys, randomly shaped objects that function as keys, and the game even has a mandatory sliding tile puzzle, just to fill out the annoyance rainbow.\n\nThe character models still look pretty good, but the textures look awful without an HD mod. It's to be expected, considering the age of the game, but it's still enough to make it difficult to understand what you're looking at sometimes.\n\nThe game loses steam as it goes along. The opening chapters in the creepy backwoods villages are the high point, where your guns are weak, ammo is scarce, and enemies mob you in huge numbers. However, as the game does on and you leave the village areas, weapons become more common, you level up yours, ammo is more abudant, and the game feels like it rapidly begins to run out of toys to show you. The game ends before this becomes stale, but there are large stretches of the game where you'll be fighting ""guy"", ""guy in robe"", and ""guy in vest"" for an hour or more, only for the game to suddenly throw in a monster that looks like what someone from Silent Hill dreams up after a night on dodgy seafood, only for it to be killed and be seen again, maximum, twice later. In fact, I only remember fight the ""wolf' enemies MAYBE two or three times in the entire game.\n\nIf your inventory is full, but your gun is not, you can't pick up ammo to put into your gun without dropping something (permanently losing it), picking the ammo up, then reloading. Super minor, but still annoying.\n\nLike I said, this game is AMAZING. It's part of gaming history, and the fact that it was willing to experiment with new things pretty much made it revolutionize games to this very day. Don't listen to my bitching, they aren't dealbreakers, and I don't even think about those issues when this game comes up in conversations. \n\nPlay it. Do it.\n\n",Recommended

I'm a classic Resident Evil fan and I do agree that this game's direction is a bit of a slap in the face.(It's up to us to stop Umbrella huh?

No, instead he gave you a gun and offered to shoot him back.  I swear I was going somewhere with this analogy, but I lost myself there for a second.  Look, this game is fun ok?  Ok.

"You know, I think everything that could be said about Resident Evil 4 has been said about Resident Evil 4, and probably by people better qualified than me, as I played the first three games of the series (or at least parts of them) but never was a huge fan of it.  I still plan on playing the REmake of one and zero, but I have never been a huge fan boy of this series, and in fact the new one scares me enough that while I probably will play it I'm not sure. \n\nYet I'll try. \n\nResident Evil 4 is commonly known as ""The really good one"" especially to people who didn't like the odd tank controls of the original Resident Evils and didn't like how actiony the fifth and the sixth games are.  And while I disagree that this is the only good game (I rather enjoyed 5, and I respect the original trilogy at least from a distance) I can't deny that this is probably the best one of the series with out counting anything after 5. (I know six is worse, but VII does look incredible, though it does look like a bit much)   but I digress. \n\nResident Evil 4 has you play as Leon Kennedy the wise cracking bad ass secret agent who is tasked to protect the president's daughter.... except she's already kidnapped, but somehow not your fault so you now have to go in and find her and protect her.    And while yes Leon isn't a wise cracking guy before or after this mission, he is here, and it works. \n\nLeon walks into a village and basically you know the plot.  Well you can guess it.  There's a zombie virus that is out and about and pretty much everyone is infected, they come at Leon, Leon can kill or run away from then, and rinse and repeat.   What you might not expect is a whole new story that actually never uses the words Umbrella Corp, in fact this game connects to the original game mostly through Leon, which is yet another refreshing change from the original games. \n\nThrough the game, there's a remarkably interesting and in fact great story where Leon unravels exactly what's going on and discovers an all new zombie threat, with new characters, new allies and enemies.  I almost feel like the people at Capcom realized how silly it was to be making a fourth game in the series and rather than playing it straight, much of this game is played up for comedy, usually coming from Leon's quips.  So much of this game works in this way that it's hard to take it serious, but it's also impossible to completely dismiss. \n\nAnd it all works.  A cheesy but mostly serious story works, Leon is an interesting character, the president's daughter (Ashley) is a great character, and then there's the game play that works with it.  Overall though the story works in a different way.  It's the way that five wanted to work but didn't have the charismatic protagonist who just makes fun of the absurdity of it to bring the whole package together. \n\nThe game play also delivers while it does feel similar to the original games, the new third person mode changes everything.  No longer do you have awkward angles that fight against the player.  The player is able to use dual sticks to move and aim at the same time, as well as a button to ready the knife or the gun at a moments notice.  There's a little awkwardness of having to ready a gun and then hit X to fire it, the same with a knife, but the steam controller streamlined this process for me, so I was able to bypass that awkwardness.    But the controls are vastly improved from the original games, even if they aren't perfect.  \n\nHowever the game play isn't as fluid as it could be.  It's improved, but the controls to turn around are awkward as it can get, and the player pretty much turns or walks, the controls don't really allow an easy movement, and watching the game you'll notice that the player moves awkwardly.  This is likely to assist the odd game play rules the game wants to make, but while this is a huge improvement for the series by this point, it will feel awkward to anyone who hasn't played the original trilogy and realize this is improved from the tank control.  A lot of people compliment the controls but honestly... Well Spec ops the line has good third person controls, this still has awkward controls at times.  You will get used to them, but you shouldn't have to get used to controls at least not for the reasons that this game requires you to become used to them. \n\nThough the controls rarely got in the way, it did happen but really this game isn't about tight controls but more about resource management, namely bullet.  You can't buy bullets in this game ever, so instead you need to manage how many bullets you get and where you use them.  If you do this successfully in the first half of the game especially managing your money (mostly used for guns and upgrades) in the second half you can start picking up rocket launchers and such for bosses and make the game quite easy.  In fact most of this game is relatively easy as long as you can avoid wasting bullets on most enemies, or only using bullets when necessary.   From that point it's mostly dealing with zombies, using your precious ammo sparingly and then exploring a really great set of locations. \n\nSo how is it trying to do this?  It's actually incredibly fun and tense.  Like I said for the first part I honestly kept being afraid I was going to run out of ammo (I don't think I was every very close until the mid point where I should have been switching guns a little more often, and got low on hand gun ammo).  But for difficulty, it's actually a bit easier than I expected.  I admit that I used a rocket launch on a few more bosses than I could have, but overall, this game is more fun than challenging.  However if you do want a challenge, the game does offer a harder difficulty, and at least three additional modes, each of which worth playing for different reasons. \n\nOn the other hand after about 20 hours of playtime which I believe is a little slower than average, I was done with this game.   I didn't feel a need to jump into a second playthrough as 20 hours is very long, and the side content was interesting but I didn't want to play that right away.  Yet, 20 hours is well worth the price of admission and you can easily get 30 or more hours just replaying it.  I know a number of people online brag about how many times they beat the game and how they go through the game (the game allows multiple choices of how to go through the game as well as strategies) so you can play multiple times. \n\nSo overall how is it?  Honestly it's as good as everyone has said, this is easily one of the best Resident Evils I have ever played (again haven't played VII yet but it won't ruin this game even if it's better) and just a great action game.  It's a zombie game that doesn't take itself too seriously, and it's a action game that doesn't go too off the rails.  I really liked this game.  The controls and fluidity hold it back from being as great as I have heard people calling it (Best game ever?  Guys come on) but still this is such an easy recommend because it's really a fantastic experience. \n\nTo finish, I know this is a port and some people have had issues with it, but I've had none, though I believe the game did force close on me a couple times, in over 20 hours I might have only had a couple minutes dealing with it once or twice.  I had a blast with this game and I'm likely to return to try a professional run at some point.  Just not right away.",Recommended

"Full disclosure: This is the sixth time I’ve purchased this game. (Gamecube, PS2, PC (disc), PS3 Resident Evil anthology, PSN and steam. \n\nLeon S. Kennedy is back! This time he is far away from the previously neutralized Raccoon City and turns out his is not even a cop anymore. Instead, Leon abandoned his career in law enforcement and was hired by the President of the United States to track down his kidnapped daughter. Right away this does not sound like a typical Resident Evil story line. No zombies? No Umbrella Corporation? Well fear not. Leon travels to Europe where there are reports of the President's daughter being sighted and Leon is about to walk into his most deadly and challenging task yet. (looking back at this statement, the events that took place in this game are a cakewalk to what Leon experiences during Resident Evil 6)\n\nMoments after arriving in a small Spanish village, Leon concludes things are not right. The villagers do not respond to any kind of civil conversation and approach Leon in a hostile manner. Villagers who attack Leon sometimes walk, sometimes run and even dodge Leon's gunfire. Some villagers will stop their everyday tasks and approach Leon carrying pitchforks, knives, axes, sticks of dynamite and even chainsaws. Right off the bat this scenario presents a series of tense and spine-chilling sequence events as this is one of the first instances where a Resident Evil character is faced with what seems like an army of intelligent beings. This is a vast departure from the mindless, roaming bands of zombie's Leon constantly encountered back in Raccoon City. These villagers show significant signs of intelligence, breaking and climbing through windows, propping up ladders and throwing weapons.\n\nGameplay\n\nLeon begins with a pistol, but eventually Leon will have access to a shotgun, TMP, rocket launcher and a series of grenades, a weapon that is new to the Resident Evil series.\n\nBut merely using these weapons is not the impressive aspect of Resident Evil 4's gameplay. It is the level of detail displayed as the result of hitting an enemy: Shooting a villager in the torso and watching him stagger backwards, then Leon runs in for a roundhouse kick, blocking a stick of dynamite or knife by shooting it in the air only to have the weapons injure the enemy's themselves, shooting an enemy in the knee or leg as he falls to the ground where Leon can shoot him in the head, or the classic aim for the headshot which puts ""most"" enemies down for good. Another first in the RE series is the option to purchase new weapons and upgrades from a black-market dealer who resides in several locations during the game. Sometimes after killing an enemy, whether it be a villager, snake, dog or even a helpless bird, bat or fish, an enemy will drop an item you can sell to merchants, ammo or health items. Leon will find priceless jewels hidden throughout the game that he can sell to the dealer as well as most other items he finds or is in his possession.\n\nResident Evil's trademark camera angles are gone. Previously the games used a camera angle that became slightly annoying and a pitiful excuse to keep the game frightening and jumpy. You could never choose to see what was around a corner, for the camera angles were fixed in one spot and the only way to see what was growling or moaning was to continue walking and wait for the camera angle to change again. In Resident Evil 4, you now have the luxury of constantly and comfortably looking over Leon's shoulder in a much improved third person view. In addition to the new camera angle, Leon can no longer lock onto a target like he was so used to doing in Resident Evil 2. Players must use the right analog stick to aim with a sighted-laser on where exactly Leon wants his bullets to go. This opens up an entirely new style of gameplay that was not present in prior Resident Evil games such as: the ability to shoot down objects hanging from the ceiling, solving puzzles that involve breaking something and even some incorporated action-adventure styled gameplay which include kicking villagers if they are off balanced from Leon's gunfire. Around certain environments throughout the game, Leon can jump through windows, off of rooftops, over water, kick down doors and dodge obstacles and boss attacks, all by simply tapping two buttons on your gamepad (which is required) when promoted on the screen. This feature brings an entirely different dimension and enjoyment never before experienced in a survival horror game. Also, do not think you can sit back and watch the flashy cut scenes without consequence. Many cut scenes required players to hit certain buttons which are key to Leon’s survival. If you do not press them in time, you will die. \n\nWhen engaging enemies, if Leon happens to run out of ammo, no more entering the items menu to equip the knife. A quick and easy hold of R1 will enter Leon into his knife stance ready to cut up some meat. Leon can also use the knife to open crates, break windows and cabinets that might gain him access to other items.\n\nGraphics and Sound:\n\nGraphically Resident Evil 4 for the PC is a bitter disappointment. Granted, they did upgrade the game playing graphics to look pretty good, but they failed to update the cinematics and cut scenes from the previous version. The bottom line is it is a horrendous port and will probably take away a lot of the eerie and subtle spookiness that the Game Cube version was so successful in delivering for first time players. At some points the cut scenes are barely recognizable and all a player will make out is a bunch of brown blocks. The loading scenes through doors are also poorly done which was an essential part of the creepiness of past RE titles.\n\nThe sound effects are relatively the same across platforms and save what could have been a total loss for the Resident Evil on PC. Crows chirp on trees as Leon walks through the forest, and the moaning of townsfolk can be heard in the distance and when one sights you, they will speak in a primitive language. The voice acting in Resident Evil 4 is again top notch and will not distract gamers from what is happening on screen like the original Resident Evil was known for.\n\nPros: Outstanding gameplay control, top notch story and voice acting, the spookiest RE yet, the new content in PS2 version is also in steam version, the longest Resident Evil story date,\n\nCons: Poor port results in blocky cut scenes and cinematics, quick time events\n\nBottom Line: This game inherits all the qualities of a Resident Evil game as well as subtlety incorporating  newer action game mechanics. \n",Recommended
A really good friend always told me that this was his favorite game of all time. Of course I had heard how good it was but I finally got around to playing it and can say that it lived up to my friend's praise.\n\nThe story and dialogue are a bit cheesy and relatively predictable and the controls are going to throw you for a loop if you grew up on FPS or regular third person shooters. If you stick with it though the controls wil start to feel natural and you'll find yourself in some of the most tense shootouts of your life against mutants and worse.\n\n9/10\n\n,Recommended

"Where do I even start with Resident Evil 4... If you haven't played this game by now, you have missed one of this century's greatest gaming achievements so far.

Now, I may be giving this game some high praise, but it's not without it's quirks.\n\nPros\n[list]\n     [*] I have played this game multiple times over multiple generations of consoles. I have not gotten sick of it yet. It is a classic you cannot help but come back to every year or two.\n     [*] It isn't advertised, but this game has a built-in handicap system. It will go easy on you when you're not doing well, and it will bring the pain when you're doing great. \n     [*] Best game in the series.\n     [*] Tank controls that are actually fun.\n     [*] This game has a charismatic quality that can't be described. \n     [*] The knife is OP.\n     [*] The Merchant. He is your best friend. Do not forsake him.\n[/list]\n\nCons\n[list]\n     [*] Ashley. While the whole point of the game is to escort her to safety, she is [b] the [/b] most annoying part of the whole game. She will constantly get in danger, she is useless by herself, and will need to be babysat whenever you are with her. If you're okay with leaving Ashely in a corner until you kill all the enemies, you will love this game.\n     [*] Use a controller if possible. The mouse controls for aiming are garbage.\n     [*] Some enemies will become symbols of hatred in your mind. [b] cough [/b] Novistadors [b] cough [/b] [b] cough [/b]\n     [*] Voice acting. Resident Evil games are notorious for having terrible voice acting, and this game is only slightly better.

"Disclaimer: I have not played any of the Resident evil games previously, so bear with me.\n\nResident evil 4 is widely considered one of the best games ever. At first, I thought that this game would be nothing special. I was wrong. A friend of mine told me to try it out. I never had any intention of playing this game but I picked it up.\n\nStory: In this game, you play as Leon S. Kennedy, a former cop (although only for a day). He travels to Spain to rescue the president's daughter. Who's being captured by a cult. However, what you find in Spain is completely different. You find this crazed village full of people, mutated monsters and all kind of gothic things going on. All related to some kind of 'virus' that you'll eventually find out. But the reason why this game is oustanding is because you don't actually fight zombies or something like that. You actually fight human beings with rakes and shovels.  And it's just really creepy/funny in my opinon. \n\nGameplay: The gameplay play style is more focused on Hit-zone aiming. Meaning, you could shoot enemies in different parts. Such as, shoulder,  arm, head. Shooting them in the head will not neccesarily kill them. However, it will kind of 'blind' them for a split second. However, the controls are completely different in this game. They are called 'tank' controls, which basically means you have to turn before you can move forward and etc. \n\nOverall: Overall resident evil 4 is a great game, and it does live to its hype. If you haven't already, like me finished/played this game. I would strongly advice to play it. It's one of the greatest games that I've ever played.\n\n\n\n\n\n",Recommended

Welp, if you wanted a breakdown:\n\nMECHANICS/GAMEPLAY: 8/10 It's in third person and is definitely clunky. You cant move while you're shooting and it took me a little to get used to focusing my movements (more W + A or D rather than W + mouse).\n\nWEAPONS/SHOP: 8.5/10 The game does great in making the weapons unique. At first I was like ""why anything but the shotgun?"" ...then ran out of ammo and life. Like, literally. So I learned to value the situation and weight which weapon to utilize accordingly. Range? Burst? Pin-point? Llama?\n\nSTORY/CHARACTERS: 8.5/10 I just switched from playing Rise of the Tomb Raider and.... this is so much better. Like.. story, characters, progression, action, mechanics... Yeah, I like Resident Evil 4 so much more. The story, while I used to think the games were mindless and dumb, is actually very intriguing and has had quite the world built up for it. I love the intro and protagonist. They do great in making the characters unique and remembered... unlike some other games I've recently played :P\n\nCOMBAT/ATMOSPHERE: 8.75/10 Part of the legititude behind the atmosphere in Resident Evil 4 comes from, in fact, it being clunky. So long as the mechanics match the gameplay and play off the story and all is in sync, I love the graphics. Reminds me of the glory still found in the original Bioshocks (1 and 2 before remasters). Not saying I'm against gorgeous graphics, but these stand the test of time as proof that there is more to a great and legendary game than meets the eye.\n\nAll-in-all, I am still playing through the campaign--and can hardly wait to keep at it and right into Resident Evil 5 and 6.

I reinstalled this game in hopes that the added ram would make a difference. It did, but it was still too laggy for me to enjoy.

"Game of the year 2005 for multiple game publications. Had this game back in the ps2 era and I loved it. If you wish to try out this game for the first time do use a joy stick. \n\nOne thing that this game does amazingly well is that it adjusts it's difficulty based on how well you are doing, and you won't even notice the game doing it. If you're playing well, you keep getting challenged, and those that are struggling, get an invisible helping hand. It keeps you from outright rage quitting the game. Regardless of the difficulty. Tho the helping hand is to a lesser extreme in higher difficulties.\n\nSay you died a few times in this one section it'll remove an enemy or two, and add some extra ammo/health drop from sources in some spots. Just like that if you're breezing through this section the game will add an extra enemy or two and instead of health and ammo drop you might only get money.",Recommended
"[h1] Introduction [/h1]\nResident Evil 4 is a single-player horror-survival game developed by Capcom where the player takes control of a special agent named Leon S. Kennedy to save the president's in-game daughter, Ashely Graham after she went missing at a remote village. The enemys (or ""zombies"") are referred to as Ganados and the player must battle through the village (and other areas) to save Ashley and her cliche princess-like kidnappings. It is defenitly a game that re-defined the horror genre.\n\n[h1] The Gameplay [/h1]\nResident Evil 4 is a third person shooter, meaning the player's point of view is on Leon's shoulder. While this does tone down the horror a bit, the game would've been very different without it. Resident Evil 4 in first person would've been a whole different kind of game, although with the monsters it probably would've been scarier. \n\nThe gunplay is satisifying. For some god for saken reason Leon has a laser sight on all (and I mean ALL) of his weapons. I'm suprised they didn't have a laser on the knife. You're unable to move while aiming so you run or shoot, and you can't do both like most modern games. \n\nThe combat is a SHIT ton of fun because the enemy's have multiple weak points that Leon can exploit. If you hit them in the knees they'll fall to their knees and you can get them with a suplex, busting their head open. If they get too close you can do a spinning roundhouse kick which sends the enemy flying and knocks back the rest of the enemys around you. \n\nThere's multiple weapons that the player can buy. Want to go with a grenade launcher? Go ahead! Want to go with an SMG? Go ahead! Want to go with a pis- you get the point. \n\nThe inventory management is unqiue and the player must make heavy choices as to what to take. Should you drop your herbs and grab the pistol ammo or try and make each shot count and keep your herbs? It defenitly adds tension to the game because if you don't plan your items correctly you will get stuck on stages of the game for a VERY large amount of time. This is another thing that's amazing because the game was released in 2004.\n\nLater on in the game you get Ashley as your sidekick (referred to as some as a waste of space who sucks up your herbs and constantly whines for help.) and she is the most annoying part of this whole game. You're happily grabbing loot?\n""LEON, HELP!""\n""Oh.. no.."" [b] Game over. [/b]\nAll because the ganados took her away. When you get the costume set 2 she gets armor that makes her invincble, but this is still aboslutey annoying, and I was stuck multiple times on the PS2 in 2009 because of this.\n\n[h1] The Difficulty [/h1]\nOne part that confuses many people in RE4 is that (other than professnial mode) you cannot pick your difficulty setting at the start of a new game, it just tosses you right in. But RE4 did something very unqiue that still holds up to this day, and most developers have never done it.\n\nThe game adjusted the difficulty for you. If you were speeding through a level and shooting up enemys, the game would add less ammo pickups and deploy more enemys in the level. If you were getting pounded and dying multiple times the game would add more pickups and less enemies. While this doesn't sound impressive today, you need to understand that this was in 2004. This doesn't sound like much, but 2004 was almost [b] 9 years ago. [/b] That was something that made RE4 stand out HEAVILY from any other game at the time, including Half-Life 2, Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, and many other games.\n\n[h1] The Characters (plus Storyline) [/h1]\nThere are a few main characters in RE4. To avoid spoilers I'll just talk about the main two:\nAshley Graham\nLeon S. Kennedy\nThe basic storyline is that the president's daughter went missing and was last heard of in a remote village. You take the role of Leon S. Kennedy, a special forces agent who specialize's in round house kicks, having a shitload of lasers for his guns, and having an edgy haircut. Shortly after arriving Leon goes into a house, seeing a middle-aged, slighty overweight man looking at a firepit. Leon asks if he has seen Graham, pulling out a picture of her.

"Been a resident evil fan of movies and games so I'll recommend this one.\nIf you can't wait when its sale, buy it. Its worth it.\nSame goes with resident evil 5, 6 and 7",Recommended
This is my favorite game of all time I have bought and played it on every every system it has came out on. The keyboard controls are not that great on the Pc version so I recommend a controller. It will controll just like the orginal after that and most people complain about those controls but they are perfect for this game. Saying that I have like i mentioned before played this many times so The controls come easy to me. I would also recommend this game for the amount of content thats included with it you get the main story which beating it on multiple difficulties unlock speicial items making the campaign replayable. There is also Two other mini storylines for Ada Wong that add more to the main game after completion. On top of all there is a aracde mode letting you play one of 5 charcters in four different maps to kill zombies to get the highest score before time runs out. You can also unlock more for the main game with this mode as well. even without all these extra modes I have got hours of enjoyment with just the main game so this just adds to the fun and greatness of this game.,Recommended
"It's a horrible port. The 30 fps mode stutters heavily despite my PC being way over the recommended settings while the 60 fps mode suffers from plethora of glitches, such as some animations being still locked at 30 fps, some enemies dealing damage twice as fast, QTEs requiring twice as much button mashing, etc. The port is broken and the HD textures don't even look too good.\nThe game is awesome, though. If you can, get it on PS4 or Xbone.",Not Recommended

I've been looking forward to play this 'best game ever'. Quite disappointed to realize that the control/aiming dynamics are horrible. At least for me this is unplayable. Puzzled I didn't see this mentioned in any reviews when I checked out the game.,Not Recommended
"I have pretty conflicting feelings about this game. When I played it originally on the PS2 around 2005, I loved this as much as RE1-3 because I felt it brought a lot of new gameplay and game design elements to the series without straying from its roots. Since I haven't played it in about a decade at this point, this was almost a new experience for me to replay it and I have to say: it hasn't aged well. Resident Evil 4 is hard to recommend in the current year; if you can tolerate some older game mechanics and unintentional cheesiness, you will enjoy the experience but it definitely isn't for everyone.\n\nThe biggest game design issue I have with the game are surprisingly the controls. While I loved the tank controls in RE1-3, they feel out of place in a third person shooter. Leon always feels stiff and slow, as if you're steering a bowling ball instead of the Hollywood action hero the game thinks he is. Two control methods are available but neither really fixes this problem. ""Classic"" controls are the way the game controlled back in 2005: tank movement with mouse aiming and your POV locked to your aiming or movement direction. ""Modern"" controls acts like a twin stick system, with freedom of movement with WASD and camera/aiming independently being done with the mouse. I would normally prefer the Modern system but there is no camera snap/reset option available. This makes movement very frustrating because you have to constantly aim the camera manually while walking around. Coming from games heavily inspired by RE4, Dead Space 1 & 2, the default controls feel really archaic and the modern controls feel unnecessarily clunky and cumbersome. I don't expect the original game released before DS1 & 2 to have better controls than its ""predecessor"" but I would expect a ""Modern"" control scheme to function with better nuance.\n\nApart from the molasses controls, you still have the original RE4 experience here along with your post-game padding. Replaying RE4's Leon story in 2017 feels like two separate games; Up until the Salazar fight, the game's atmosphere is much more survival horror-esque but feels aimless and meandering. Salazar's fight feels like something out of Code Veronica, after which the game completely jumps the shark and is practically a different game. If I could just replay the B-movie absurdity of the post-Salazar campaign I would replay it almost annually like RE2 & 3. Unfortunately (possibly because I beat it 3 times previously) half of this game is a cheeseable snoozefest thanks to the RPG-7 and the ever-present Merchant & overly frequent saves.\n\nRE4 is still a good game worth playing in 2017, but in hindsight I now prefer RE2 & RE3 for annual replays. Much of this game feels like padding and without better controls it is frustrating to play. I would still recommend it to fans of the series but only once you're tired of replaying RE1-3. The HD upgrades have improved it visually but there aren't enough new enhancements to make this worth purchasing again if you already own it on another platform.",Recommended
"THIS IS A GREAT GAME - A MASTERPIECE\n\nI came into this game hating it from previous experiences, but I was drawn in like a badly drawn stick figure.\nRE4 mixes in B-movie action and absolute horror (those fucking regenerators) to make a great experience.\nThere's also so much content...which makes me disappointed when I realise how shit the future games where (with the exception of RE7, of course).\n\nIn short, just get it and stick with it. You'll enjoy it.\n",Recommended

this was my first contact with the Resident Evil franchise. I can't even say for sure how many times and how many hours i spent playing it on my ps2. Even today i still love to play it. Oh and it's has uncesored deaths of course.,Recommended
"I'm super late to the party with this one. It's one of those games that I've tried many versions of here and there over the years, but never sat down and played through. This time though, it finally got it's hooks in me and once it did, they went deep. About an hour into my second playthrough I knew that I had to play it all. I beat it on professional, beat all the Ada side stuff, unlocked all the mercenaries, everything. I still want more. I booted up RE5 for a sec, but it can't compare. There's something magical about this game. Without a doubt, one of the the best games I've ever played. \n\nThis PC version is top notch. Out of all of the versions I've tried (Original Gamecube, Wii, PS2, Xbox 360) this is the best. The only technical issues I've noticed are that the frame rate of the reload animation for the rifle looks like 15fps or something. Doesn't really bother me considering everything else is smooth as butter. Also, the cutscenes for the Ada campaign are pretty low resolution. Not a huge deal, but considering that the rest of the game has been polished up so much, it stands out. \nIf you haven't played this, buy it. If you want to play it again, this version is the best one in my opinion.",Recommended
"So far the story seems fine, sequences are better than most of today's games.\n\nThe controls are game breakingly poor, neither with a mouse nor a controller can you turn at any real speed. People can walk up to you and hit you before you can get to them and aim. Mouse has horrible input lag even with vsync forced off, aiming with a joystick can take 2-3 seconds even after a couple hours of practice.. \n\nHonestly if this game came out today, it wouldn't sell over $4..",Not Recommended
Still one of the best RE games.,Recommended

"Simply one of the best games ever. Gameplay mechanics, story, characters, and visuals are all compelling and work together. It's a lot of fun. Unfortunately, as of 11/27/17, the port to PC seems to have been done in a very sloppy manner, with minimal effort to make sure it actually ""works.""",Recommended
"I have played this game many times, on many different versions. I can happily say the Steam version does not disappoint. I have, however, encountered a weird glitch with a couple of the QTEs around the 2nd half of the game where no matter how hard you mash the buttons you just fail. We're talking about easy QTEs that no previous version ever had me struggle on, but stragnely, they're passable by temporarily locking the FPS at 30.\n\nResident Evil 4 is one of those games that I got swept up in. Back in 2005, it was hard to pull me away from my many playthroughs, and it's a good thing that this game is long and packed full of content. I loathe the game many times when I reflect upon it for ditching the survival horror and going full-on action, but when I pop it back on, it's too fun to deny. I understand why Capcom made the design choice, and I certainly enjoy the newer camera and perspective, but everytime I play I can't help but wonder at how much more intense the game would be if the ammo was scarce and you weren't getting rifle rounds off of pitchfork weilding peasants, or even grenades from a crow.  The common enemies would provide more scares in my mind if it were more like the first few entries in the series where you had to pick your battles. Imagine blocking yourself in a shack with 50% health, enemies trying to get in from every window and only a scarce supply of ammunition. Retweaking the whole game to make this a reality I'm sure would be too big of a task.\n\nAnd so, it's indeed Resident Evil 4. It's one of those games like Super Mario Brothers or DOOM. You already know it, you know if you'll like it or not. The best in the series to some, the one that turned it into something it's not to others, but this game to me is a milestone and a classic either way you look at it. If you want this game on Steam, aside from the QTE issue I noted for myself before, they didn't do it wrong here. When I first played this on the Gamecube, it truly felt next-gen compared to most other games we were seeing at the time, not just in its visuals, but in the tight gameplay.  Over 10 years have passed and the game still feels fresh and exciting.",Recommended
"Widely regarded as one of the best video games of all time, and for good reason. Despite being 13 years old, the incredible variety of environments, enemies, weapons, and level design prevent this game from feeling dated (other than from a graphical standpoint). Granted, it does have several of the older video game tropes, and the classic RE cheesy voice acting, but if you've been a gamer for at least 15 years, the grand scope of this title will more than compensate for anything else. The PC port runs at a smooth 60 fps with HD textures and the campaign will give you at least 20 hours of entertainment, and that's not including the 4 mini campaigns available after the main one is completed. A must buy for any serious gamer, especially on sale.",Recommended

"My favorite of the Resident Evil games. From playing it on the Xbox and switching over to PC, I have the nostalgia of playing it when I was younger so that may help. It's still the best story out of the games I have played. It's both a con and a feature that there is no multiplayer because while it would be fun to play the best Resident Evil game with friends, it is incredibly fun to experience the story alone and is a game I will always come back to experience again in the future.\n\n     Some say the inventory system is the worst, but I find it to be a lot of fun. Being able to spin things around and find room to maybe cram in come more heals or attachments.\n\n     The customization for the weapons is incredibly fun to me. Purchase new guns then grab new attachments like stocks or scopes. You can also tweak a guns damage, fire rate, reload speed, and more from the shop.\n\n     Overall a great buy. Better than most games you can buy nowadays. Only issue I've had with it was lag the first time I launched it which I didn't understand, but turning on V-Sync fixed it and I've never had a problem since.

"First released 12 years ago, RE4 has aged better than any game of that era. The gameplay is still perfectly paced and exciting the whole way through, the story is still surprisingly engaging given its simplicity, and the set pieces feel distinct and stick with you well after the end credits roll. Only the graphics have suffered over the years, not so much in the character models as the scenery. In particular the backgrounds in the distance of several sections, which looked okay a decade ago, are now shown to just be some fairly low quality flat images with trees or whatever on them. If this game were given a full visual update with modern graphics but identical everything else, there would be no hint that it was three presidential terms old.",Recommended
"I genuinely just can't get into this game.  It looked like it would be fun, even with the fact it's pretty old, but the controls are just so clunky.  For example, you can't move when aiming!  This results in being inches too far to attack something with the knife, then just getting stabbed repeatedly with a pitchfork.  No strafing as well makes even moving extremely awkward.  You can only move backwards and forwards, which makes it even worse when trying to escape a hoard of enemies due to the above mentioned issue with attacking.\n\nIt looked like it could be fun, but just got incredibly frustrating almost immediately.\n\n** (edited to fix typo) **",Not Recommended
"My favorite Resident Evil game, in terms of when they switched to the modern style gameplay.\nUnlike the newer games which focus too much on Action gameplay, 4 is the one that mixes and blends the Horror and Action elements the best.\nThere's still a lack of puzzles like the oldschool Resident Evil games, but atleast it has some!\nHighly recommended.",Recommended
it really do be like that sometimes,Recommended
"Resident Evil 4 is a fantastic game that's stood the test of time. While it does feel aged in some regards now, its core gameplay is so well designed, polished, and varied that it remains far more enjoyable than most games that have come since. Simply put, it's one of those games that just feels right. In particular, I always liked how differently the enemies react to various weapons and even to exactly where you shoot them. Head shots, arm shots, leg shots, all have different results and may or may not be the best choice based on the current situation. Factor in deciding which gun is best for which time, and whether it's worth using the bigger guns and their rarer ammo at this moment, and it's a game that rewards good choices as well as good aim. And on top of all that, every new area of the game provides an interesting layout and set of enemy placements to deal with, often with no single safe spot to stand. Don't focus too much on holding one path because odds are, there are more enemies coming up from behind you. The end result is an action-packed game that stays interesting from beginning to end. Though with that said, newcomers to the game may need to give it a little patience at first, because as noted, it is a product of its time.\n\nMost notably, that means you have to choose between moving and shooting, which will probably feel pretty awkward to those used to modern third person shooters. Resident Evil 4 was designed around this limitation however, so its not nearly as much of a problem as you might inititally think. Simply put, the game never throws anything at you that requires you to move and shoot at the same time, enemies move and react in a way that gives you time to move in and set up a shot between attacks, or pull of a shot then run out of the way of their retaliation. Ultimately, I'm not saying the game is better for nailing you in place while attacking, but it's not worse for it either.\n\nHowever, more annoying to me is another issue that also used to be common for its time - the narrow field of view. While it was perfectly normal for back in 2005 and never bothered me back then, it does drag the experience down now. The games's till tons of fun, but I really do think that for an ""Ultimate"" HD version, the option of a wider field of view should have been there. Not being able to properly deal with enemies simply because you can see so little of what's immediately around Leon did get in the way of my fun at times, and unlike the other mobility issues, I don't think the game design really neutralizes poor visibility as a problem.\n\nAnd of course, the are the visuals. Despite running at a higher resolution now and having been brushed up a little here and there, It's still a 2005 game at heart, and it's still pretty much using those 2005 art assets. The characters themselves actually look pretty presentable still, but the environments do look fairly bad now. Mostly due to the muddy, low contrast lighting in my opinion. And then followed by the low-res, weirdly grainy textures. Nonetheless, the game itself is so fun that ugly brown environments and poor lighting can only really drag down the experience a little. And occasionally, the game still looks legitimately good even by modern standards. Just not so much in those dim, generic ambient lighting caves.\n\nAnd as long as I'm complaining, the game could really use some audio options. Like, literally ANY audio options, because there are none. Personally, I think the default volume is too high, mostly in terms of the music. I would have very much liked to turn it down a little while leaving the sound effects as-is, but nope. Closest I could get was just turning my PC's master volume down so that RE4 wouldn't be slightly too loud, at the cost of making its sound effects a little quieter than I'd prefer. It may not be a huge problem, but at the same time, there's no excuse for Capcom not including the most standard of audio options that practically every game has.\n\nOther than the audio though, I'd say it's a good port, everything worked fine from the start and the game never once crashed or locked up on me, which is all too rare for any PC game I've put this much time into. It may not be exciting, but until the time that PC gaming finally gets overall stable, I say any game that runs reliably deserves having that noted in its review. I didn't even have any weird minor problems that required a trip to Google to answer.\n\nUltimately, Resident Evil 4 isn't perfect, and I think it could benefit from a few minor updates and tweaks, (and totally redone lighting, maybe just a full HD facelift for the environment visuals overall,) but it's still an extremely good game I'd recommend to anyone and solidly in my list of favorite games ever, even twelve years after its release.",Recommended

In short, we've been jipped out of more fulfilling experiences and complete games and it's a rather somber thought until i just pick this one up again and get lost in it for an hour or so at a time and remember when this was its own pinnacle of gaming and how it can still stand up to and beat out some AAA titles for me.

"The most painful review I've ever written.\n\nI first played Resident Evil 4 as when it came out on the Gamecube.. then again on the PS2... then again on the Xbox... then about seventeen thousand more times on various platforms. I can tell you where to go, how to get all the key items, where all the hidden treasures are, and how to exploit all of the boss' weaknesses. I used to have Ashley in her armor, Leon in his gangster outfit, the hand cannon.. the whole nine yards. \n\nResident Evil 4 is easily in my Top 10 Games of All Time list. So why don't I recommend it?\n\nBecause... it's just.. so... SLOW. And I don't mean the frames (they were locked at 60 for me, no problems there), I mean the game itself lags. When you turn, or aim, or anything moves, everything just crawls to an absolute halt. I made it to the first night and got to the Luis/Leon cabin battle when I just couldn't take it anymore. Everything was just too damn slowed down. \n\nI ended up just busting out the ol' PS2 and replaying Resident Evil 4 to get my fix, and that was completely worth it.

The animations are great, story, items, weapons, compleation bonusses, controls,  bosses, voice acting, the music, the guns, the balistics too are great, almost everithing in this game is great. i raccomad to play it at least 1 time.",Recommended
Incredible game. A classic i find myself returning too. Good horror and action.,Recommended
RE4 is a very good game if you haven't played it yet and like third person shooters I suggest you go ahead and play it asap. A lot of content and good replay value. Leon is boss.,Recommended
Love this game so much,Recommended
I love this game. Had to get it remastered,Recommended
So I decieded to replay the RE series again starting at the first and work my way up. I remember being awesome when I orignal played it and I am glad it holds up to my memories of awesome. It remains in my honest  opinion the best Resident evil in the entire series,Recommended

"Resident Evil 4 is, and will forever remain, a masterpiece. It says a lot when you can pop in a game over a decade old, and still get as engrossed into everything it has to offer like it was the first time ever experiencing it. If you have somehow still never played this game, put down whatever game(s) you are playing and make room for this survival horror smash. And if you've played it countless times on several platforms, it's still worth forking over a couple of bucks to revisit this legendary game.\n\n10/10 for this gem that never gets old even after all these years.Thank You Shinji Mikami\n\n",Recommended
It's just as good as I remember.,Recommended
It's an escort mission I absolutely love.\n,Recommended
This is the reason why I play video games. Resident Evil 4 is the perfect example of developers taking steps in the right direction towards new and questionable ideas and they did a superb job when RE4 was originally released on gamecube. I'm glad it was ported onto other platforms so others could experience a wonderful Resident Evil,Recommended
A Classic that I always find myself going back too no matter the system it's on.,Recommended

"Resident Evil 4 is one of my childhood games that I believe I'll carry it fond memories in my heart forever . When I first saw its trailer back IN 2014 , I was really intriguied to play it on my PS2 but alas I really got disappointed when I learned it was a Game Cube exclusive . But gladly it eventually become a multiplatform game and gave everyone the opportunity to enjoy this masterpiece . The Resident Evil francise always managed to surprise its players with its tight combat , cleaverly designed puzzles and stressful moments of horror  and RE4 really lived up to its franchises standered . It has a gritty story with stressful and breathtaking moments , grotesque and disturbing enemy designs that manages to haunt the player even when he is not playing , 3 difffernet creepy locations , a couple of really good boos fights and a plethora of bad ass weapons to aid to reach your objective at any cost .Sinji Mikami and his amazing dev team managed to make a proper balance of action , storytelling , level design and puzzzle in this game which I really appreciate .  Even it's been 12 years since the game was released , it really aged well and reamins as the pioneer of third person oer the view game genre which inspired games like gears of warf , batman arkham series and many more . \n\nMy personal rating : 9 / 10  A must play for everyone",Recommended

"One of the first / major third person survival games to be made. The predecessor to games like Dead Space and also Evil Within (same creative director). It has a lot of variety with interesting locations and different enemies to make each of the areas unique up to a point.\n\nA ""crowd management"" type shooter with tank controls and a progression system that allows players to choose how they want to ""level"" their weapons. Some may be put off from the lack of mobility but be aware that the garden variety enemies (not bosses or special one-hit kill enemies) actually run but go to a walk when they get close. It's the games way of promoting anxiety from being overwhelmed but not frustratingly so.\n\nFor those that have played the original version, the differences are mainly through the damage model. The re-mastered version has all of the damage rescaled so don't be fooled by the new numbers for some of the weapons. Some weapons will appear earlier through the merchant as well. The rest of the game is untouched, mobs and hidden treasures are where they originally appeared.",Recommended
Still one of the best Resident Evil- and Action games ever made.\n\nControls on the PC version are a bit weird but one gets used to them.\n\nAlso mods!\n\nIf you need numbers:\nThis game gets 2 Verdugos out of 1 Salazar.,Recommended
One of the best resident evil. You should play it if you haven't already played it.,Recommended
Good game! 10/10.,Recommended
"RE4 is still one of my my favorite action game of all time. It's timeless. Replayed it recently, and it still feels as excellent as it did back in school when I first played it. It's easily one of the best paced games ever made.\nThe gameplay is absolutely fantastic. It's limiting(can't shoot while moving, Leon is a bit sluggish, FoV is narrow) but only just - it doesn't feel irritating, yet it creates a great sense of tension. Often in that game you get attacked from the side or back, and all you can rely on is sound cues.\n\nPlus, it had great gunporn. Lots of guns, different characteristics, upgrades, and they all felt fun to use. Plus the inventory system is still easily my favorite of any game ever.\n\nRE4 was creepy and challenging in a way that the RE5 and future iterations didn't seem to embrace. You really had to watch your ammo. The enemies were brutal but so, so memorable; who can forget the chainsaw farmers, the garradores, the Iron Maidens, U3 or Krauser? There was plenty of replay value and the unlockables for harder difficulties actually felt like you had to undergo some real shit to get the bonus weapons.",Recommended
"So after completing this again on pc, I can still say that after all these years this is still one of my favorite games of all time. Pick it up while it's on sale, as it can go for quite cheap, and give it a play to the end. Hopefully you'll be able to suck as much joy out of it as I have",Recommended
A very good game.,Recommended

"The year is 2017 and a lot of games came out that have improved on the formula set by Resident Evil 4. But does the King hold up today? It's safe to say it does; it holds up extremely well. Granted, its successors improved on the speed, controls, and horror but in terms of a perfect balance of horror and action, Resident Evil 4 still holds the crown.\n\n[h1]STORY[/h1]\n\nThe protagonist, Leon Scott Kennedy, is a US government special agent sent by the POTUS to find his kidnapped daughter, Ashley, from the clutches of a cult called the Los Illuminados who are situated in a remote area of Spain. He is escorted by two local officers but is soon separated and forced to conduct his investigation alone when the villagers attack. Later, he finds out that the villagers are infected with a parasite called the Las Plagas which grants them speed and power and frightening mutations. Leon's goal is secure the President's daughter and successfully exfiltrate, but he is met with overwhelming odds stacked against him.\n\nThe story of Resident Evil 4 is serviceable and does its job. After your initial playthrough of the game, you unlock Separate Ways, another campaign featuring a different character, which has its own story that fills in the gaps of the main campaign. The personalities of the characters come through the well directed and well voiced cutscenes. \n\n[h1]GAMEPLAY[/h1]\n\nResident Evil 4 is a third person action adventure game that moves into an over-the-shoulder perspective when aiming. You will shoot, knife, grenade and even perform context specific actions like kicking and suplexing through mobs of enemies. The infected villagers (aka, the Ganados) put up quite a fight and they'll come at you with everything from simple tools like pickaxes and knives to instant killing chainsaws. They'll flank you when they can, and weave in and out of your targeting reticule. Leon can literally break heads with a well placed shot or suplex but that may not always result in a death for your foe as they can have their Plaga come out of their head. Factor in 3 different types of Plaga, and you can see Leon definitely has a lot on his plate to deal with. \n\nYou'll also face monstrous foes like the acid spewing, bug-like Novistadors or the horrifying creature called the Regenerator who, as its name implies, regenerates lost body parts despite the massive amount of damage you deal to it. You'll find Ashley early in the game and you have to protect her while she is with you. Enemies will either bee-line straight to her or carry her away (both leading to a Game Over screen if they manage to do so). You can give her rudimentary commands like Wait and Follow, and even have her hide. She even has her own playable section later on in the game.\n\nWhere Resident Evil 4 truly shines is through its brilliant boss battles. These encounters will test your mettle to the fullest. While challenging, the game is fair and perhaps, most importantly, fun. Leon is only able to take a few hits before he keels over so the game has to be fun for the player to keep returning to it. \n\nThrough the help of a Merchant, you get to buy weapons, items and even upgrade your arsenal through through the money and treasures you find in the game. You start off with a handgun, but as you progress, you'll be able to buy shotguns, magnums, sniper rifles and so on. You are, however, unable to buy ammo (which is kinda funny because you can see the Merchant with ammunition all around, but I suppose this is deliberately done so that the game doesn't become cakewalk because players happened to buy a crap ton of magnum ammunition). You'll also have access to a fun diversion in the form of a shooting gallery where you can unlock collectable Bottle Caps of characters in the game. The game has QTEs, both in-game and in cutscenes, so you have to pay attention. \n\nThe game has numerous set piece moments like riding a boat to harpoon a monstrous lake beast, and a mine cart sequence where enemies drop in from above, so the game does a lot to keep you surging on adrenaline. After you are done with the main campaign, you'll unlock Professional Mode (aka Hard Mode), and a bunch of extras - Assignment Ada (a short campaign where you have to find 5 Plaga samples), Separate Ways (a full fledged campaign that fills in a certain character's role in the main campaign), a movie browser, new costumes for the main campaign, and the excellent Mercenaries (a very fun time attack mode where you play across different maps using different characters and score points by killing enemies). \n\nResident Evil 4 is purely a single player game. There is no multiplayer or co-op of any kind in the game.  \n\n[h1]AUDIO[/h1]\n\nThe game sounds great and the soundtrack is well done with some memorable tracks like the 'Save Theme' and 'Serenity' (the song you hear when you are with the Merchant). The enemies sound terrific and send a chill down your spine (the labored breathing of the Regenerators come to mind). Sound effects are excellent and everything sounds very convincing. Do yourself a favour and play this game with the headphones on.\n\n[h1]VISUALS[/h1]\n\nResident Evil 4 boasted some of the best visuals back in 2005 on the Gamecube and the PlayStation 2. The PC port supports higher resoultions, 60 FPS, extra filters, and HD textures. If you want the game to look even better the vanilla release, download the RE4HD mod; it is still a WIP (work in progress) but makes the game look insanely good (google RE4HD and see the results for yourself). If you have the rig to handle it, you should download the mod. \n\nThe artstyle of the game does a great job and the game still looks decent to this day. The game does have film grain but it's not overblown like in Resident Evil 5. \n\nThe PC version of RE 4 is not perfect - I encountered crashes in the Garden Maze section in Leon's campaign which I managed to overcome by quickly making it through the maze, but the crashes for the same area in Separate Ways required me to stop the TabletInputService in the Services tab of the Task Manager and modifiying the game's config.ini to have the game run at 15 FPS. This is the only way I got the game to stop crashing in the Garden Maze section in Chapter 3 of Separate Ways. If you encounter crashes in any other areas, try following the above steps and see if it helps you. \n\nThe game also doesn't run well on low end rigs. My potato of a laptop had no problems playing Resident Evil 5 at 720p and 30 FPS with a mixture of medium and high settings but this game runs worse than a game that came out in 2009. I was forced to lower the resolution to 800x600, turn off AA and motion blur, have shadows on Low, and play using the default textures to get the game running well at 30 FPS.\n\n[h1]OVERALL[/h1]\n\nResident Evil 4 is more than the sum of its parts. The game stands the test of time despite it being  12 years since release. It's evident that the game was a labour of love back in the days when Capcom was great and not Crap-com. RE 4 is easily one of the best games of all time.\n\n[h1]Note to Prospective Buyers[/h1]\n\nThe game is a 9.1 GB download on Steam. \n\nThe game works on Windows 10 perfectly. I had some crashes while playing this game.\n\nResident Evil 4 has Steam Trading Cards. \n\n[h1]Note to Achievement Hunters[/h1]\n\nThere are 12 achievements to get in Resident Evil 4. Getting 100% should take 2 playthroughs (one on Normal, the second on Professional) of the main campaign and a playthrough of Separate Ways.",Recommended

If you haven't picked it up, you can purchase it through Valve's very own Steam for a meager $4.99.

"Still a pretty nice game with a great story. Resident Evil 4 is also in the Horror Genre where a good RE should be and not in this too Action-sided Genre like RE 5 or 6. Playing as Leon Kennedy on the mission to rescue the presidents daughter. Wide Range of weapons to get rid of tons of zombies. Including some special weapons like rocket launcher, minethrower and a rifle with the effect of a flashbang. Some of the weapons are hard to unlock too. Playing on profi will also give you some more areas which you can't enter on easy. In this version with improved graphics which are looking really good. And you can play as Ada Wong too. You can see her way what she did to trigger some things in the main story. Only the strange controls are something you have to deal with.

"Resident Evil 4 is without a doubt one of my favorite games of all-time and clearly in my top 10.  It is the 2nd Resident Evil game I finished playing after Resident Evil 0.  I purchased it when it first was released for Gamecube back in 2005 and it blew away all of my expectations which were already held very high. I bought it again for the Wii Edition with the new fun and engaging aiming controls.  Now, once more for this HD Steam release.  I've lost count of how many times I've played through this gem of a game.  It seems there's something new to experience with each playthrough and the game can be approached in so many ways with the variety of balanced weapons.  The story is crazy and memorable and will have you and your friends quoting goofy lines from Leon and company for years to come.  It is a game that has stood the test of time and is a must play for anyone who appreciates a good action game.",Recommended

Granted, I'm not as down on the current generation as many others are, but I did notice most games getting shorter and more cinematic over time.  This isn't necessarily a bad thing, as it works perfectly for some titles, but I really miss the days of getting lost in a complete time sink that's just so satisying, everything from upgrading to buying new weapons, etc.  There's something about this game that makes it feel like a warm blanket on a cold winter's night.",Recommended

"Resident Evil 4. This game is truly amazing. I first played the game on the Nintendo Wii and the experience was amazing. This review may be a little bias just because of nostalgia reasons, but this game is amazing (Let me explain). This game has ditched most horror aspects of previous Resident Evil series, but Resident Evil series for me never was pure horror. In my opinion, it was usually atmospheric horror with action. In Resident Evil 4, it's an atmospheric horror/shooter from a third-person perspective. It has some clanky shooting mechanics which only allows you to aim but not able to move. Resident Evil 4 offers you a New Game+ which allows you to play the game over again with your fully upgraded weapons which makes the game a breeze. After finishing the main game you have 3 unlocked modes which include Ada's separate ways, Ada's Assignment, and mercenaries mode.",Recommended
"Put sooooo many hours into this game back on the wii. By far my favorite in the series, especially the bonus features unlocked after you finish the game. I must have put 3-4x the hours in survival mode alone compared to the main game. A lot of fun as I replay now almost 10 years later.",Recommended

"I really don't see what there is to enjoy about this game, and do no recommend it.  The plot makes no sense, and has Grand Canyon-sized holes in it.  The dialogue is cringey, lame, non sequitur, and delivered with some of the worst voice acting ever.  The setting is all variations of brown.  Brown village ... brown castle ... brown military island.  The AI is actually mentally disabled.  Every enemy very. slowly. creeps. toward. you ... affording you infinite time to pop off a headshot, or to kneecap and suplex them.  There is absolutely no challenge in the gameplay at all.  In fact, all the weapons have laser sights to compensate for the really crappy over-the-shoulder perspective.  What's event he point of that?  Why do I care to study the back of my characters neck in a game whose main elements are shooting things?  The game is riddled with quick-time-events, none of which give enough warning to submit the keystrokes ... half of them using the unintuitive ""x"" and ""c"" keys which makes no farking sense since you hand is resting on ""wasd"".  And some of these game-over-inducing QTE's are in the middle of a cut scene, so I'm not even paying attention and my hand is off the keyboard scratching my scrotum when all of a sudden I get a game over screen and have to sit through the insipidly stupid scene again!  There is a grand total of 3 pieces of music in the entire score: merchant/save room, ominous tones to try and make you feel spooOooOoky (rolls eyes), and boss battle music.\n\nAnyways ... the main campaign took me about 18 hours to beat (I played it blind, and I horded loot and searched around a ton, in hopes of something interesting ... spoiler alert, nothing in the game is interesting.)  I give it a 4/10 and a ""Do not recommend"".  Good day to you.",Not Recommended

"I played the game twice and all the short games through. The story line leads the player through a linear path, which after the constant backtracking of the first game in the Resident Evil series, I actually enjoyed it. The puzzles were a challenge but all doable without resorting to online help. The playable characters are all very likeable, especially Ashley in her second outfit. Talk about increasing the heart beat! Did not like using the PC keyboard to maneuver. At least the point of view can be changed wth the mouse (unlike in RE1). Definitely recommend it!",Recommended

Resident Evil 4 is best described as the turning point in the series where it left the old style of first 3 entries and started going in a more third person shooter style of direction. While not as action focused as RE5 and RE6 are it stikes a balance between horror aspects and your traditional third person shooter with action elements mixed in. This of game is of course a remaster of the original Resident Evil 4 with all the extras for it and you can toggle between the original SD and HD textures in the options menu. Unforuntatly you have to do it before you actually start playing it which means no mid game toggling between the two. On the upside though because it includes all the extras from the orignal gamecube and PS2 versions you are getting a solid value for your money. Unfortunatly not all of the game was remastered and some cut scenes namely the ones for the Seperate ways missions are still in their original SD format though the core gameplay does remain with the HD uptick. The only other real downside to this remaster is the lack of achievements you can earn as they're pretty much regulated to the main game with none for the Seperate Ways camapagin or some of the other extras. While not a big deal it would have been nice to see some achievements set aside for the extra content included.,Recommended
"With input deadzones so massive, this was a chore to play. I managed and was ok with it untill I got to RE5 and felt proper input agin. Campy story, worse acting and the dialouge. I only recomend this if you like camp and cringe. Also the enviroments totaly lacked the dark atmosphere from RE and RE0. Here the series goes from a bit campy B scifi horror to over the top spectacle action game.",Not Recommended
"I got introduced to this and Super Smash Bros in college.  Someone had a GameCube, and I had never played either.  This and Smash Bros were the reasons I went and bought a GameCube.  This game still holds up well - still fun to play.  The AI is similar to RE 5's, and if you know the exploits to make the AI stupid easy, this game is the same way.  The ONLY complaint I can really think of about this and RE5 are the stupid Quick Time events.  You just die from not pressing a button combination in time, or mashing a button fast enough.  Really kills the pacing.\n\nOther than that, love this game - it isn't a horror game any more like RE1, it's more of an action game with zombies.",Recommended
"For a game that was made in 2005, the graphics were great, the [b]story[/b] itself is so appealing and even after finishing it on my PS2, X-Box 360, and mobile, I still want to play it again and again.

"Just went through with my bi-annual Autumn tradition of replaying this game. I've lost track of how many times I've finished this game over the years and on all different versions. Comments about the port can be found later down in the review. \n\nIt's hard to write an unbiased review for this game - simply put, this is my favorite game of all time. It's got a great mix of a spooky atmosphere, deep combat system, campy storylline with hilarious catchphrases, great artistic direction and a very nice sense of pacing - the game knows when to dial up the action and knows just when to dial it down for you to take a breather with a bit of puzzle solving/exploration. The weapons are immensly satisfying to use - the shotguns feel like a force of nature, the magnums are the definition of a ""handcannon""; even the pistols feel like they pack a punch and each time you land a headshot and see the enemy's head blown clean off it just makes me happy in ways that I cannot describe.\n\nIn terms of structure the game is linear but there's just enough hidden pathways and hidden treasures to be found that it doesn't make the game feel like a straight corridor to the finish line. What I probably love most about the game is how varied it is - it always manages to throw in a wrench in the works so you are fighting enemies in interesting ways; be it on diffrent points of elevation, on a minecart or in a labyrinth so you're always watching your back. The game even does escort missions right - the girl you're escorting always stays glued to your back (unless you tell her to wait somewhere) and never gets in the way while adding tension to the encounters yet also giving you a break from your escorting duties at certain points in the story so that you're not always doing the same thing.  I should mention that I don't find the game very scary - it is infamous for breaking away from the previous games in the series' horror roots but taken as an action game on it's own terms this game shines based purely on it's refined gameplay.\n\nThe game is also full of content when you finish the game: you unlock a New Game+ mode where you have access to new weapons/costumes, you get two (one very small and one 3+ hours) campaigns featuring a side character and the addicting Mercenaries mode which can be described as a ""horde"" mode of sorts where you're killing enemies to add to your timer and chase highscores; Mercenaries is so fun and has enough playable characters and stages that you could easily waste 20+ hours on it alone. You also unlock the Proffesional difficulty mode which I wish was unlocked from the start for returning players. \n\nNow in regards to the port I feel that this is a good version of the game but I had some annoying hick ups in the game. I played through the game using a controller - the M+K controls for this game is nothing to write home about but since the game was originally designed for controllers I can forgive it for that. The button layouts for controllers are not customizable - you have three different layouts but none of them were exactly how I wanted them - not a dealbreaker as I managed to adapt but still very odd that such a simple feature wasn't included. In regards to the controls I had a very annoying bug happen during a boss fight - a quick time event popped up and the button prompt was for a keyboard button even though I was using a controller so I had a few unnecessary deaths. I had to put the keyboard in my lap and take my hand of the controller when the QTE popped up - not the end of the world but it felt sloppy of the developers. I also had the game crash on me when entering a door forcing me to replay a lengthy section of the game. \n\nThe positives of this version does outweigh the bad though in my opinion even though it isn't perfect - this was my first time playing through the game in 60 FPS and simply put I'm never going back to an older version of the game; it really felt like I saw a game I knew like the back of my hand through new eyes. In terms of visuals the bump in resolution is appreciated but certain assets end up looking pixelated - these assets looked like this in the original release so I'm personally used to it but it bears mention. You do have the option of switching to newer textures - these look all right but many elements of the game world lack the gritty worn down feeling that the originals had. For example, the original plank wall textures really look nasty and worn down - the newer textures look like they were cleaned last week. I could take it or leave it honestly as I prefer to play with the original textures. Also some animations are locked to 30 FPS - the reloading animation of the sniper rifles being a notable example but these are far and few between. I should also mention that load times were close to non-existant on my Nvidia 960GTX/Intel i5-6600K/16GB RAM rig with no slowdown whatsoever.\n\nAll in all I recommend this version of the game. Some newer players might find certain design descisions a bit strange - infamously you can't walk and shoot at the same time, but the game is designed around it - but this game was very influential on gaming as a whole when it first came out and I believe there's still a lot for new players to love in this game; it really feels like a unique beast being released at the end of the PS2-era while at the same time introducing features that still can be found in games released today. \n\nI'm already looking forward to Autumn 2019 when it's time to give this game a playthrough again.",Recommended

"Great Resident Evil game. Big survival horror game and extra scenarios. At the beggining I had some problem with controls either with keyboard either with my ps3 controller.

But in one scene where I had to climb before I fall in a cliff My controller didn't respond and I couldn't pass this scene and i stucked and I couldn't continoue the game. After, some research I found out that I had to change FPS In options from 60 to 30 before start my loading. I didn't like that. But the rest game is excellent.

"Hmm. This is a bit of a complicated one. It’s not a complication that stems from trying to explain what Resident Evil 4 is, because that’s fairly easy to do – it's a survival horror and action hybrid, seeing you taking on hordes of violent villagers and sinister cultists in a mission to rescue the president’s daughter from a dark and terrible plot. Nor does the problem come from gauging the general public opinion surrounding it, which essentially sees it lauded as being absolutely brilliant and arguably one of the best games ever made. The fact of the matter is that the complication lies in the simple fact that despite this nigh-on critical acclaim, and against my best efforts, I... Uh... Don’t really like it very much.\n\nIt took me a little while to work out why. At first I thought it was the story; after all, the voice acting is laughably awful, and there are not so much plot holes here as much as there are plot ravines. Yet after the initial wave of cheesy lines were spoken in a manner that made me facepalm so hard my hand nearly came bursting out the back of my head, the sheer audaciousness of how bad the plot is becomes somewhat charming. This is a schlocky, over the top B-movie experience and the game knows it, with so many quotable lines being flung your way that any initial scepticism soon fades away into unbridled joy for the whole camp spectacle.  Nor was my problem the sound design, which is non-ironically excellent - with chanting, foreboding music and much more working together to create quite a menacing atmosphere throughout the whole journey. \n\nMy problem, it turns out to be, purely stems from the gameplay and level design choices that are on display here. There are just so many little issues and bugbears consistently appearing throughout, that they mar the core enjoyment that comes from merely shooting the bad guys in the face. To provide examples; some areas require you to stand and fight while others require you to flee, and often it takes far too long to differentiate between the two. In cases of fleeing, there’s no point even trying to put up any sort of combat effort, because enemies will just continue to infinitely spawn without warning. And, despite the escort sections being reasonably thought out, there were still too many moments which felt like I failed purely due to the AI behaviour being a little too unpredictable.\n\nOn the issue list grows, with even core concepts of the game floundering - I don't mind the idea of not being able to move when firing, but the reality is it doesn't actually translate into gameplay that’s particularly riveting. It's more of a case of fire at the enemies, run away a bit when they get close, then repeat the cycle. This comes to a head with the boss fights, whereupon in most situations you can dodge these eldritch abominations and their devastating attacks by simply slowly jogging past them. \n\nThere's also so many rooms and areas that feel as if they only exist to burn away your time in some fashion – most of the roadblocks to your journey simply require you to get the funny shaped key for the funny shaped door, and that never proves to be a simple point A to point B endeavour. At one point I even came across a hedge maze and was struck with an overwhelming desire to simply turn the game off, such was my certainty in knowing I’d have to wander around for far too long shooting enemies that were practically destined to appear.  Anyone familiar with this game should also know exactly what I mean when I say ""water room”, and I'm not having you argue that as the pinnacle of excellent level design. \n\n I’ll concur none of gameplay faults listed above are truly horrific, and perhaps some of you out there would even find them endearing – defining traits of the series as a whole. Yet to me they just lower Resident Evil 4 down to a level that for the most part I would describe as “distinctly average” – a far cry from the flawless masterpiece that I was perhaps expecting to encounter.\n\nThere's a reason why I think this doesn't feel like a stellar experience nowadays, however. Oddly enough, I think it stems from the fact that back at the time of its initial release, it was the [i]definitive[/i] stellar experience. [i]This[/i] was the game that invented the idea of the over-the-shoulder perspective in third person games. [i]This[/i] was the game that also created the precision aiming system that went hand-in-hand with such a perspective. Heck, it could even be argued that it was this game which made quick time events into something that you can’t escape from in most action titles even to this day. If Resident Evil 4 didn’t exist, you most likely wouldn't have titles such as Gears of War. Or Uncharted. You certainly wouldn't have had a series such as Dead Space, and I could keep going with this list if you had several hours to spare.\n\nPut simply, it was the title that set the benchmarks. Yet by doing so, it also devised the means by which it inadvertently shot itself in the foot. You see, so many games have since taken those benchmarks, and refined and honed them via a great deal of time and effort into something that approaches perfection. To therefore go from playing the polished titles of today to the system that's in place here... Well, it can't help but feel like a step backwards, a regression into something that can no longer hope to provide the same sense of satisfaction. In many ways, I feel like Resident Evil 4 should be considered a museum piece; something that should be respected, remembered, and admired. It's just perhaps not something that should be taken out of its case all that often. \n\nIn summary, if you were to turn to me and ask me to recommend a good action title or survival horror, I'm not going to turn back round to you and say that you should be giving Resident Evil 4 a whirl. I simply ended up confused and frustrated too often for me to say I had fun with it, despite what it manages to do right. That, however, doesn't mean I don't respect the game for what it is and what it managed to do to the industry. If you're looking for a piece of history or a trip down memory lane, you've come to the right place. Otherwise, I'd think twice before taking the plunge.",Not Recommended
"The point where Resi went to shit.\nBut I DO recommend this game.\n\nAlthough totally different from previous entries, it's an extremely fun game.\nLots of guns to use, lots of enemies to kill, good controls and lots of contents.\n\nThe game is very lengthy and the extra mini-games are very fun, so you get a lot for what you pay.",Recommended
"Resident Evil 4 is a game that I have played for years back when it first came out on Gamecube and to this day, I still find it a game that I have highly enjoyed after over a decade. This particular PC port of the game is great, but it does have its fair share of problems that do hold it back from being perfect. \n\nFor just the game itself, Resident Evil 4 is definitely a game that is easy to get into plot wise if you did not play the previous Resident Evil games. There are references and a few things that only the older games can explain, but if you are new to the series, you can easily grasp what is going on in the main plot at least. Really all you need to know is the basic premise, you play as Leon Kennedy, you are sent to retrieve the U.S. President's daughter who has been kidnapped and is in Spain being held by a cult of parasitically infected people. That's all you need to know and it is a good plot with some admittedly enjoyable conversations between characters here and there. The gameplay is what really kept me playing the game for over the years of playing it since it first came out. It played like every other Resident Evil game with pressing one button to aim and the other to shoot, but this was the first game in the series to have the over-the-shoulder camera that allowed you to aim for body parts of enemies which they reacted to accordingly depending on where you shot them and you could kick them or even suplex them. You could carry much more, the merchant to purchase weapons and a few select items and also upgrading those weapons. It was still challenging and it was a mix of horror and action. Even with how action packed it was, there were times that I did feel some fear or uneasyness. Each of the 3 main locations of the game, the Village, Castle, and Island, have a good amount of length to them and I never did find myself bored with any of them. The main game itself will last anywhere from 7-10, depending on difficulty, rather you want to go for side treasures, and how thorough you're going through each area of the 3 locations. \n\nOn this port of the game, the controls, in my personal opinion are good for the most part. Using the mouse to aim and shoot, shift to run, W and S to move forward and back, A and D to move, and Space bar to use the knife. What was weird though was the inventory controls. WASD moves you in the inventory and enter to pick up and move an object, but to turn an object in a direction to have it more easily fit is mapped to the Pgdn/Page Downbutton. I will not understand why of all buttons it is Page Down is the button to do this. What could've been better was Q and E and I have to wonder why Capcom didn't make it them. Aiming did feel a bit weird as in it kinda felt sluggish sometimes, but it's something that I can easily get used to. As far as I also remember, there were no ways to rebind keys in the options and I can assume you can through the .ini files, but it's not exaclty practical. QTEs are controlled with X, C, and the mouse, and again, these work fine for the most part. There was one instance that I can remember where something really was off about it, and that was near the end of the Castle during the Salazar Statue Chase sequence on the bridge that leads to the final area of the Castle. You have to rapidly press X to keep yourself from falling, and I do not know what is up with this part because I pressed X as fast as I did in other sections that require you to rapidly press it, and failed just this section multiple times. In my experience, I would say that using a controller is better for this game as it makes QTEs better, it's not as weird to move stuff around in the inventory, and it feels better with the aiming. \n\nReturning mini-games from past versions of the game are Assignment Ada, The Mercenaries, and Separate Ways/The Another Order.  For those who do not know, Assignment Ada is where you play as, of course, Ada and you have to collect 5 samples from a certain sections on the Island and you can not upgrade or purchase new weapons. The Mercenaries is where you pick a character and stage and you have to get as many points before time expires and if you get a certain rank at the end then you'll unlock a new character. Separate Ways is basically an unlockable side story, it plays out like the main game, except it's shorter, you can buy and sell, but can't upgrade weapons, you play as Ada, and it shows what she did behind the scenes in the story in the span of 5 small chapters. Now I do have one big annoyance between this side stuff, and it is just with Separate Ways and it's something that also happens in the game, albeit not nearly as much. Every single cutscene, every single last one of them, is pre-rendered and not rendered in-game and the quality of the cutscenes are not really good. I would actually say that its bad, and the jump in quality from in-game and to pre-rendered is very noticable. They looked fine back then, but the jump to HD did not take well to the pre-rendered cutscenes.\n\nThere's also another weird thing that happens with the game and it's with the sniper rifles, and quite possibly with Minethrower, but I have no idea since I haven't used it. For whatever reason, both of the sniper rifles in the game have some weird FPS issues. Both of them have lag when reloading, and also after every single shot with the bolt-action. With the semi-auto, it only affects the gun as everything else will move at normal speed while the semi-auto reload just looks like it is lagging, and I think it's even worse with the bolt-action and I think, although I can't quite remember, actually lags the entire game. \n\nAs for Ashley's AI since she's one of the main parts of the game as you escort around the entire game, in my personal opinion her AI is not bad. She always tries to stay right behind you and follows right behind you, and she crouches down if you ever aim in her direction. She'll hide, stay in one place, or follow you when told. However there were times where she stayed crouched for a while even though I wasn't aiming and she could easily run away from enemies, but those barely ever happened. \n\nWeapons that you will be using in the game range from different types. You have 4 different types of handguns, 3 shotguns, 2 sniper rifles, 1 SMG, and 2 magnums, and this is not counting the unlockable weapons. Each of the weapons feel unique in their own way, so much that even the weakest of guns have their own strengths that does give some sort of incentive to try out each one. For example, the standard pistol you get in the game is weak, but it has a change of popping heads easy when fully upgraded, while the Punisher pistol is weaker, but it can shoot through multiple enemies, or the Riot Shotgun has a tighter spread and has better range than the other 2 shotguns, but the Striker Shotgun has largest magazine capacity. It's not hard to tell that some guns are better than others, but each gun acts a bit differently and each one can be useful in someway or another.\n\nThere's not much that I can say about this game really. It's a solid fun game with a good story with some enjoyable moments, has a nice blend of horror and action, various enemy types and bosses, 3 locations that are expansive and you'll feel in a way that you are going on some sort of adventure, various types of guns that act differently, different enemy varieties, and the game has plenty of content to play. \n\nIn short, I do recommend this game to the highest for both fans of the Resident Evil games or people who are new to the series.",Recommended

"One of the best third person shooters ever made.  \n\nRather than churn out some generic & overly serious story with no sense of personal identity RE4 delivers a completely bizzare and off the wall homage to American horror/action films that plays up the camp factor for intentional and self aware laughs.  \n\nResident Evil 4 even still today remains the best 3rd peron survival horror shooter ever made.  The campaign is an absolute blast from start to finish; the story feels like it was made by Japanese people that didn't understand english well (I mean this in a good way) who grew up watching bootleg copies of Rambo, Die Hard, and other classic American action movies and then they mixed that level of action and ridiculousness with elements from classic horror movies; movies like Evil Dead and campy slasher movies.  \n\nChances are you already know Resident Evil 4 is amazing and you're just watning to know how this port is.  On the bright side, it looks amazing.  No doubt; visually this is the best way to experience this game.\n\nUnfortunately, this game has some pretty bad technical bugs at times.  The worst of which is that it'll slow your game down to feel as though you're playing in slow motion.  It's like getting 5-10 FPS but instead of being choppy it's like someone but you in a bulletime sequence from Max Payne or the Matrix and you got stuck there.  There's multiple times throughout the campaign that I encountered this bug and each time it's about 5+ minutes of basically truding through the muck that is the cancerous FPS bug.  \n\nEven though this bug is certainly a hassle, it's a minor marring on an otherwise amazing product.  This HD remastering and improved FPS (except for the aforementioned bug) are no doubt the most visually impressive way to experience the masterpiece that is Resident Evil 4.",Recommended

"Resident Evil 4, where do I start. \n\nThis game threw out everything RE did before and it made it even more amazing.\n\nThis game decided to not have much of a story and really only had one plot device, that the President's Daughter was kidnapped. Of course there are a ton of things that you could question from that, like if it's the President's Daughter why didn't they send a squad of men to Spain where she was kidnapped?\nBut hey who cares? \n\nLORE\nYou play as Leon Scott Kennedy an American Federal Agent for the Division of Security Operations, which prior, served in the Raccoon City Police Department for ONE DAY, and his actions that ONE DAY made someone say ""yeah lets recruit this guy because of how well he did for ONE DAY""\n\nThe person you are trying to rescue is Ashley Graham the President's Daughter who was kidnapped as a way for Los Illuminados to gain control over America's Presidency. Weird.\n\nGAMEPLAY\nControls in the game are pretty nice, however Leon loses his ability to walk once he aims, remember this when you want to get out of a tough jam, because oh boi you ain't doing that today.\n\nThis game is also a strong believer in Fight or Flight and really relies heavily on that mechanic, you can run by a ton of dudes, but, you also have a chance at missing a big thing of loot while you do so, like Ptas or Ammo. (Pesetas are currency in the game. I'll speak about it in a bit.)\n\nEXTRA \nHow about weapons in this game? \nWell you have a good amount of choice in this game as far as weapons go. There are ways of getting them from really anyway possible. You can hunt for Pesetas, or beat the tons of extra things in the games like the extra campaigns for some sweet weapons. Now, I hear you asking ""Why do I need money when everybody is a zombie like who am I gonna go to fo-' you have to go to ya boi, The Merchant, this mysterious dude provides you with top quality weapons this whole game. Some of it can get expensive, so you either have to sell your old stuff, or get some pesetas.\n(EDIT: You can actually kill the merchant so don't do that)\n\nTHE EXTRA CAMPAIGNS\nI haven't gotten to the campaigns yet, but instead of Leon being in the front seat, it's Ada Wong, (which by the way her backstory is super long and I really don't want to write it all here so go to a wiki or something idk) and she actually has TWO CAMPAIGNS, one is pretty short and the other is about the same as the main game. \n\nWew. This was long. I just love this game lmao.\n\nOverall? 9/10",Recommended
"Resident Evil 4 was, simply put, my favorite game on the PS2, I must've played that game to the point of knowing every single hidden item by heart and unlocked everything there was to unlock  and still kept playing. Recieving the game as a gift was amazing, the ability to play the game in HD and relive the game I fell in love with.\n\nIt feels much the same with a few issues which weren't in the original, the port from console to PC is a little weird as aiming and doing certain things can be klunky and slow (Aiming for example and movement) which takes some adjusting to, another issue I had was certain settings are missing (as to be expected from a direct port), english subtitles don't exist and there's no ingame audio adjustment meaning you'll be relying on the volume mixer if you plan to stream/record the game, I have noticed *sometimes* there is an audio/visual desync during cutscenes which can be a little immersion-killing. \n\nBut here's the thing. Even with these quite big problems with a console to PC port, typical of these companies, it's still an amazing trip down memory lane, one which did revolutionise the Resident Evil franchise and breathed new life into it. I recommend that, if you can overlook these issues (Which probably won't ever get fixed let's be honest unless some modder decides to do it) to get this game.",Recommended
"Resident Evil 4 is a survival horror game designed by Capcom. The game starts out with the main character Leon, being sent into the villiage of Pueblo, Spain to search for Ashley Graham. The gameplay is not outdated by any means, yet the aiming system is a bit wonky if you are using the keyboard for the first time playing. It has controller support, good graphics, and overall good story. It has some minor problems however, when you first launch the game the game sets the FPS to 60, not 30, resulting in a minor lag. It also has no sound settings what so ever, so if you are listening to music while you play, it will most definitely be drowned out by the game. The game is slightly overpriced, but with the sales during winter and summer it usually will be cheap. The combat is very nice, the camera is amazing.

"One of the most consistently fun games I've played. It also has the most badass thing I've seen in a video game: suplexing a cultist so hard his head explodes.\n\nAt its core, Resident Evil 4 is a game about action and resource management. Your ammo matters, how and when you engage enemies matters, and what you decide to keep in your inventory matters. You will have access to powerful weapons, but with limited ammo you have to decide when the best time is to use them. The over-the-shoulder tank controls will feel awkward at first, but the inability to run-and-gun like an action hero adds to the survival horror setting in my opinion, as it forces you to pick a spot and stand your ground.\n\nOne thing that RE4 nails is its difficulty. The game always has me in a constant tug-of-war, dreading the next scenario it will throw at me. Each section of the game is unique and memorable, with different kinds of challenges to keep things fresh. It also ramps up in difficulty quite early on, letting you know that this game isn't a walk in the park. However, while it is challenging, RE4 is not cruel or sadistic; if you die, you are sent back to the beginning of the area (or sometimes a checkpoint in the middle of an area), so you never lose that much progress.\n\nWith that said, there is one issue this port has. The game logic is tied to the framerate, and since this game originally ran on 30 FPS, setting it to 60 causes unusual things to happen, as well as more aggressive enemy AI. I would recommend leaving it at 30 to avoid having to deal with any bugs. I also recommend playing the game as it was originally designed, on a controller.

"I LOVE Resident Evil 4, it's one of my favorite games of all time. I still remember the times when I used to stay up late playing Mercenaries, Separate Ways and PRO Difficulty on my old PS2 when I was about 11 or 12 years old. The game was so well made and there are quite a few ""spooky moments"". But, I can't say I like the PC port. The game, no matter if I play on the highest setting or the lowest, is just so slow. And I even get nice frames per second, 60 most of the time, even on HD Graphics. But everything in the game just moves so sluggisly and slow, like everything is happening in tenth of the normal speed. I mean, Resident Evil 4 isn't the fastest of games, you can do some cool and fast tricks if you got the skills but when I can snipe birds out of the sky with one shot (something I've never been able to master), you know something is wrong. I can't really recommend this to anyone. I've heard that the game works fine on computers that don't have Windows 10 on it so you should propably try this out if you have Windows 8 or 7. But, if you're experiencing the same problems, well, I guess you should refund the game. Such a shame... :(",Not Recommended

"I used to play this game on ps2 back in the day, I recently got it in an humble bundle and man, I forgot how amazing this game is, first of all, I remember when this game release on pc people use to talk shit about the port of this game and that you can't use the mouse to aim and shoot and I was preparing for that but I was gladly suprised that the game is perfectly playable on mouse and keyboard\n\nthis game is perfectly crafted giving you a really awesome single player experience, the ambience is fantastic, I remember the fist time I play this game as a child and just the first minute in the woods aproaching the house with the first minute scare the shit out of me, I personally prefere the village over the castle and the island but they are still great too.\n\nthe bosses are really cool all of them, I love all the fights, my favorite is del lago, the first boss, the tension and stres it can give you when you fall on the water and you're swimming for your life or when the boat stay still and everything is too quiet and watching for del lago to attack, I really love it\n\nI learned that every weapon has an unique stat that makes them all useful, for example, we all know that red9 is best9, but the handgun, the weapon you have in the beginning of the game have an unique stat that a shot to the head has a chance to be a critical hit and blow the head of an enemy, and when you fully upgrade the weapon it gives you 5x more chance to land a critical, these kind of things happens also with the other handguns and the shotguns and gives the game a lot of replay value, choosing to play the game with a certain weapon can change how you fight and be a new experience.\n\n10/10",Recommended

"Out of the resident evil games I've played so far (4,5,6) this one is my favorite. Man I get excited just thinking about it. I LOVED THIS GAME. If you want a fun classic zombie game this is it. I can't believe how good this was. Resident Evil 5 was good and 6 was ok, but wow this one has a cool creepy feel to it. You get nervous when you're surrounded and you can hear  the sweet zombie chants, and I'd get freaked out cause that meant they were coming. The whole game just has some really cool dark colors and whatnot. 5 just felt really (dusty) and 6 tried to go (really dark) and was super over the top running and sliding. I like 4 because it's slow paced, but doesn't feel that way. The enemies in this one are way fun to go against. Anyways, what a heck of a game. Get it and do yourself a favor. I beat it once on normal and had to beat it on the highest difficulty so I could say I did it. Please go do the same. And YES, this game is STILL AMAZING on today's standards. Doesn't even feel like an older game.",Recommended
"This game offers a really great singleplayer experience.\nThe gameplay is very VERY polished with gunplay that revolves around crowd control where you have to use precise shots to the head, legs or knees wherever it suits the situation and mix it with melee combat.\nI liked all enemies except this annoying insect enemy (but you encounter that enemy just 2-3 times in the whole game).\nAlso the gameplay never gets repetitive because this game has excellent pacing and you are allways in a new combat situation thats different from the ones before.\nThe story is fairly simple (you have to safe the presidents daughter) but the dialogues are just hilarious and funny and i really liked the villains (btw. this game has like 5 villains).\nWhat can turn off people is that resident evil 4 isnt a horror game anymore, which isnt neccessarily a bad thing considering that resi 7 is goind back to its roots.\nthe graphics of this game are definetly dated but its still a ""beautiful"" game with lots of attention to detail with charactermodels, animations and environment. But ive to admit that the facial animations are sometimes non existant.\nAnd there are now and again people in the steam forums who have problems with the performace or crashes of this game so i would keep that in mind when buying it. \nThe PC controls of this game are prety good, except when u  are in the inventory, because there is no mouse, so you have to use the arrow, enter, return and page up / down keys do navigate the inventory. \nall in all i recommend this game to anybody who wants to have fun with a good shooting game.\n\nbtw: ashley isnt annoying,to be honest her ai is really smart designed, she always follows you, when u aim she gets behind u or crouches so that she doesnt get in the crosshair.

"It's a great game, I do recommend it, despite I encountered quite few problems.\n\n------------------------------------\n\nDifficulty is well set, there is a lot of shooting unlike the previous resident evil, but you will be given sufficient ammo (unlike the previous games).\nNot too many puzzles to solve and they are not too hard.\nFew boss fights which are difficult mostly due to the poor controllability of the character.\nThe story is ok.\n\n------------------------------------\n\nFor me the game crashed many times during loading screens (when go through some doors that changes the level), there is a topic about that on the community hub, it seems to affect a lot of people.\n\nIt is very upsetting, because it's a console game so there is no quick save / quick load, there are checkpoints when you go through a loading screen but if the game crashes there, you can only load a save (from a type writer) from the game menu.\n\nSome guys did a great job doing a HD texture pack, unfortunately for me; I couldn't use it to help solve my crashes issues.\n\nControls are a nightmare, (again it's a console game), playing with mouse+keyboard, you can't strafe, there are some actions sequences when you have to press very quickly ""x"" and / or ""c"" (and also mouse buttons), you can't change those even if you don't use them in game.

Muito bom!,Recommended
"This game produced the most BS of all other games. Some quicktime events like XC trigger the dodging animation and Leon will still take the damage as if you you had your thumb up your ass. Incredibly difficult areas REQUIRE you to go great lengths of time without saving, and fucking guess what? Even with graphics set to low simply using the infared scope or causing too many animations will cause the game to crash. So that means no matter how much you want you can't rage quit or simply leave when you want, playing RE4 is a commitment or do it again simulator.\n\nIt gets even better when you give a useless character (Ashley) the ability to die instantly if you hit her with anything once, this includes when shes being carried. Shotgun spread and knife swing arc become annoying factors.\n\nSome enemies heads will explode revealing a parasite. All forms will die instantly when exposed to a flashbang. \nHowever a certain parasite in the game once exposed (From headshots) will 'die' from a flashbang and then proceed to continue attacking you. Heads up because they are assholes and made it HAVE to die twice.\n\nAttack reaction animations are unpredictable because you'll shoot a head armoured guy in the leg to supplex him and he'll just fall over. You'll shoot a guy in the head and the shortest reaction ever will occur and by the time you get there he swings. 'It' once you fight it outside of the caged area, will randomly change its walking speed based on what hurts it. \n\nThere needs to be more red herbs. By chapter 5-3 I had 2 (RYG) and six green herbs. For fuck sakes I have 12 grenades 5 stacks magnum ammo and 5 stacks of shotgun. The inventory room sucks with XL.\n\nIf your good at the game and can collect lots of resources you are harshly punished by missing out on ammo or by having to mix your dozens of green herbs just to pick some stuff up.\n\nThe difficultly doesn't really exist and niether does your weapons firepower they're just there to make you feel better.",Not Recommended

"I highly rate this game. It has some of the most original gameplay mechanics, that gives gaming a nice breath of fresh air compared to most other shooter titles. This game was released years ago but holds up well even today. The game is challenging and encourages you to explore your surroundings. Killing weird zombie things is super satisfying too. The cons would be that the mechanics that make this game so great, can occasionally be frustrating. Such as awkward camera angles, movement, and aiming. But take those things on as part of the challenging gameplay and you'll have great fun with it. Highly recommend.",Recommended

"For someone who has never played Resident Evil before, I wasn't 100% sure what to expect. Now that I'm partway through the third chapter, I can confidently say that I love this game.\n\nBeing dropped in the middle of what I presume to be Spain... At night... When it's ""zombie weather"" outside... With nothing more than a picture and a purpose. You soon learn there's a lot more to the village than meets the eye...\n\nThe first levels are a tad bit linear, but the storyline and mix between survival, exploration and action more than makeup for it. More than once have I been caught by a villager from behind when I never knew there was a path there in the first place. Definitely adds to the horror aspect.\n\nThe boss fights are unique and quite challenging at times (especially when you're boxed in the barn with Mendez). If you misclick, you suffer, and hard. Some bosses can kill you in one attack set, in fact.\n\nThe weapon management system is really nice when you have lots of items that you need to pack in before the next upgrade. Rotating your guns also saves a ton of space, and you'll need it.\n\nYou also don't get a lot of ammo. Ammo during the first castle fight gave me a tough time; took almost everything I had just to get downstairs and flip the switch, let alone get to the water challenge with Ashley. \n\nOverall I'd say it's definitely worth the buy. Runs great on lower end systems, and it's an enjoyable tactical survival experience. Be sure you have FAST fingers.\n\nCons:\n-Quicktime prompts appear for a fraction of a second, making them impossible to react to on the first go. It also CHANGES from M1 and M2 to X and C, so I just mash both of them at the same time.\n-The tap X quicktime events are bugged; you have to smash the X key so fast or else you fail instantly and have to redo the ENTIRE (starting with) minecart segment.

"I gave up. Didn't enjoy it at all.\n\nThe controls in this game OMFG. Tank controls were fine in the old games because they had fixed camera angles. Anyone who has played the REmake with 360 controls has experience the problem it causes. But in a 3rd person game? Get f***ed right off. I've started getting used to them but I shouldn't NEED to get used to it if they were designed properly in the first place. \n\nOr maybe they put them in because the AI is so crap that you'd just run rings around them. Oh wait, you do that anyway. At first I was trying to kill everything. Then I realised it is literally impossible to get hit if you run around them. I haven't used my guns outside of boss battles since except to shoot objects.\n\nQUICK TIME EVENTS. FFS! It is infuriating. Miss a quick time even that flashes up on the screen without warning and which only gives you about two seconds to react and you'll be back to the last checkpoint for the fifth time till you remember exactly when you need to press it.\n\nWhich wouldn't be that bad if some of these fucking quick times weren't strapped to bosses. One of which has an unskippable cut scene right before it. One in which Leon spouts some trash cheesball lines as well. I was wishing this game had permadeath so I could just kill the t**t and have done with him.\n\nThen to top it off you have to baby sit some stupid woman for most of the game. You position yourself out of harms way and she is just sat there not moving. She's ended up killing herself about 10 times while I'm playing. The only way out of this is to leave her at the beginning of the area and hope she doesn't get killed or carried off. Which kind of defeats the entire purpose of PROTECTING someone. Plus it only really works if you are clearing all of the enemies out.\n\nNaa overall I really don't care. There is nothing here I haven't seen before. The story isn't exactly ground breaking. They've turned Leon into a massive sarcastic c**t. Who despite having survived Racoon City still seems to be shocked to death about EVERYTHING.\n\nMaybe for PS2 this was breaking new ground but like many PS2 games it hasn't aged well at all. The problem with being the first game to do something is that it generally isn't done that well. Even though it hits the spot the first time you see it, it can be done a WHOLE lot better. Which games since then HAVE done.\n\n---CONCLUSION---\n\nI had moments of enjoyment. The odd time when everything started to click and I felt like it was the game it is hyped up as. But that all fell down the moment you had to start babysitting an idiot.",Not Recommended

You can't change your sensitivity so are stuck with a crosshair that moves at a snails pace; if an enemy comes at you from the side, youre dead before you can even turn, god forbid you need to change directions sharply in a chase because his turning circle is awful. Leon seems to have forgotten how to turn on the spot for some reason. \nThe graphics are crap as well, the HD remaster stuff is nonsense. I have games on my ps2 from 2000 with better textures.

I never had a gaming PC, that changed a few months back. I finally had time to buy this on PC and as always I still love the game. The game is obviously older so if you only played resident evil 5 and 6, then this game will feel funky due to movement and controls. If you want a more re5/6 controller set-up select typeIII under controller settings. Over-all the game aged very well and it's a very balanced game. The story is great, Leon is an awesome bad-ass character and the gameplay is amazing.\nThe PC port had some crashing issues, It crashed twice during gameplay, However, I read that anti-virus software could be the issue, Once I added steam to Bitdefender Exemptions the game has run smoothly so far. If you're getting into resident evil I suggest picking this game up asap.\nEdit: I have completed the game several times and no matter what I tried the game still crashed.

If you have no way of lowering your refreshrate, you can not play this game, and it's clear Capcom has no intent to fix this.

"I'm so sorry I bought this. I happened upon a mention of RE4 somewhere and thought ""Steam has a bunch of Capcom stuff, wonder if they have it..."" They did!! I have many happy memories of playing through both the GC and PS versions of this game repeatedly. So, naturally I had to have it. Couldn't wait to play as Wesker in the arena mode. \n\nI should've read the reviews first. This game is FUCKED. Like royally fucked. It's too old for Capcom to bother working on, so there are no patches available that make the game playable. It will freeze on you and stop running in certain areas over and over. There's a few supposed workarounds but none of them have done me any good. With the strength of even shit computers like mine compared to an old console, you'd think Capcom could've ported the GC version and even added stuff to it. Nope.\n\nThis is a really rushed port of the PS version. It wouldn't bother me that much (the extra gun, etc.) except you JUST CAN'T PLAY IT. Capcom never patched it. Like how hard could that be, REALLY? For a TWELVE year-old game? And get ready to chase your tail looking through the 3rd party fixes and changing file after file and setting after setting. Just go buy something else. \nAnything.\nAt least you'll be able to run it.\n\nFuck you, Capcom. Get your shit together.",Not Recommended
"I got all of the achievements and the Handcannon in about 20 hours (that's a long time imo), but I've also played several versions of this game. It may take a newcomer 20 hours just to finish a single playthrough on Normal. There's definitely some value here.\n\n It's my first time seeing it in 60fps, and it was wonderful.\n\nThis is Resident Evil 4. It's the same terrific game it always was, and isn't overhyped imo, although I do think the number of ports for the game are excessive. \n\nThe combat is uniformly excellent. You can't move and shoot, and the game is built around it. Enemies slow to a walk when they're a certain distance from you (unless they're special enemies), which gives you plenty of time to place your character and line up your shot. \n\nThe game pioneered a camera and control scheme that was only seen again in God Hand, a combination of tank controls and an 'over-the-shoulder' perspective. You'll always be able to see what you're doing. This is a scheme that I wish was still relevant as I hate adjusting the camera in the middle of games.\n\nI think some of the puzzles are throwaway since the game switched from its Metroid-y adventure roots to a linear game. I also don't really care for babysitting Ashley. You can put her in a dumpster in some rooms, but I'd still prefer her to not be there.\n\nThis game's a strong 9/10 for me. If you've never played it before (as unlikely as that is), you've no excuse but to pick this up. If you have played one of the countless other versions of the game, I'd understand wanting to pass.",Recommended

"The game is overall very well designed and the player can really tell how much effort the developers put into it.\n\nAlthough somewhat slow and a little stiff to control, the combat is a lot of fun, especially if you get used to it and figure out the different weaknesses of specific enemies (melee takedowns, staggers, etc).\n There is a pretty wide range of enemies, all with their respective weaknesses and strenghts, which makes every chapter of the game a different experience.\n\n The world is beautifully crafted, and in combination with the great sounds makes for an atmospheric, eerie adventure, especially if the HD textures are selected. Another huge plus are the many ways the player can interact with the world, whether they are looking for hidden items or ways to defeat/slow down the zombie menace.\n\nHowever, one of the game's greatest strenghts is definitely it's range of weapons. The gunplay is great, weapons feel responsive and realistic, enemies react to being shot according to the weapon used, and good aim and reflexes are well rewarded. There is a wide range of weapon types which almost all offer several different weapon models (for example, I have used 3 different pistols so far). Each weapon feels unique, due to every weapon having different base stats and a unique design. Also, some weapons have attachable extras, such as a scope or a stock. All weapons can be upgraded and purchased from the merchant, which makes looking for money and treasures really rewarding and important.\n\nQuick time events and puzzles give the player a change of pace to ensure gameplay doesn't feel repetitive, exploration is rewarded in multiple ways and the inventory managment is implemented in a creative, fun way.\n\nAlthough the game isn't perfect, as there are minor flaws such as the inability to hotkey weapons and items or some misleading enemy animations (that make the player think he could melee altough he can't), resident evil 4 is an amazingly well done blend of horror, survival and action, and is definitely worth picking up.",Recommended

"Something is causing this version of the game to crash for many players on Windows 10. It is a time based bug happening every 10-12 minutes. I use a laptop with an AMD A-8 APU w/ the R5 GPU Chip and 8gb memory, this is more than enough specs to run an old game such as this. Things I have tried include using a patch to increase the memory usage of the game, and  disabling my touchscreen service, as suggested, however this did not resolve the crashing. \nAs it stands, to see that Capcom has not released a patch since 2014 for a game so highly praised is very disconcerting.

"A masterpiece of gaming that cannot fail to entertain. This game marked the transition of Resident Evil from survival horror to zombie-themed action, and was enormously sucessful in doing so. The later games never quite captured the charm and magic of this game, which is absolutely the best of the trilogy of action-oriented Resident Evil titles: 4, 5 and 6.\n\nPros:\nFantastic, challenging core gameplay. The gameplay is so strong that the bonus Mercenaries Mode (which is nothing more than the game's core combat system) is fucking amazing.\nLarge range of weapons, and game design that gives you reason to utilise all of them.\nRidiculous, campy plot and dialogue.\n\nCons:\nThe controls can be a little unreliable at times - for example, the ""instant 180 degree turn"" sometimes doesn't register, leaving you vulnerable.\nClunky controls that might annoy some people. I'm certain that this is, however, a deliberate choice - it makes the combat sections intense and enormously fun.",Recommended

"I am not a part of the nostalgia train so I believe my review is for people who have not played this game before. The controls  are pretty bad, Of course you get used to it after maybe the first chapter but it is overall pretty bad. This game has lots of ""artificial difficulty"" and if you dont know what that is it is basically throwing hordes and hordes of enemies at you just to make the game difficult. Literally after everytime you do something you have at least 5 guys spawn that you have to kill. Not to mention the lack of ammo in the game which that adds to the artificial difficulty. The thing that really holds this game up is the really good boss design and the good mini-boss design, and the story. The reason I dont say enemy deisgn is because there are like 5 different types of normal enemies in the entire game. Overall if you can get past the horrible gunplay and artificial difficulty this is the game for you. If you love combat and dont care much for story I would say shy away from this game.",Recommended

"in president devil 4 you play as mr. leanon s KENNEDY... KENNEDY... who is the famous survivor famous for surviving the cataclysmic events from president devil 2, which we all know how that turned out if you saw the third movie. so anyway after the nuclear halocaust resulting from the government nuking the whole world, the only safe place is a small region somewhere in what i assume is mexico because most of the people in the game speak mexican i'm pretty sure. so anyway, these mexican guys kidnap the president's (you know that guy who turned the whole world into fallout 3) daughter so they can turn her into a demon secretly then send her back home so she can assassinate the guy who nuked the world (aka her father aka the president), and as a result of this the president has assigned YOU, mr leanon s KENNEDY... KENNEDY... to save his daughter, being since you already killed demons in president devil 2 so you're the most qualified to handle a kidnapping situation, obviously. now, you might be thinking that this plot is kind of racist because mexicans are often stereotyped as criminals by people in the united states (where the president lives), and I would have to agree with you, EXCEPT that after some careful deep digging, i discovered this game was made by japan, which can't be racist against hispanics, so it isn't probably isn't racist. anyway, back to the story, so you, as leanon, must save the president's daughter from being turned into a demon and bring her back safe... you arrive at a remote village, break into a dude's house, he tells you to leave, and when you don't, attempts to make you leave by force (there were two police officers right outside, but seeing as the dude doesn't ask them for help, i can only assume this is commentary on police corruption in mexico. very sad.) and when he does you swiftly shoot him in the face, and then massacre the entire nearby village, and move in to save the president's daughter. BUT THIS IS WHAT THEY DIDN'T TELL YOU IN THE BRIEFING, now this is when the title of the game started to make sense. now sure, maybe the president did nuke the whole world, but he cllearly had his reasons, if he didn't do that the demons might have spread out and killed everyone (only it looks like they did anyway), so clearly he had good intentions and can't really be the devil, right? WRONG. at this point i have reached the president's daughter, i enter the room she's in, and what do i see ladies and gentlemen? a blonde haired, hazel eyed young woman of average height and slim build... that's right folks, you've been assigned to rescue none other than IVANKA TRUMP, THE PRESIDENT WAS DONALD J TRUMP THE WHOLE TIME. but that's not even the worst part ladies and gentlemen, what they didn't tell you in the briefing is that she was ALREADY A DEMON THE WHOLE TIME EVEN BEFORE BEING KIDNAPPED. but not just any demon, oh no, she couldn't be a sexy succubus or anything like that, she had to be a banshee. the next ten hours of your gameplay experience are going to be accompanied by this bitch constantly SCREAMING and WHINING in your ear over every little thing. just constant ""LEANON I'M BEING KIDNAPPED"" or ""LEANON STOP LOOKING UP MY SKIRT"" or ""LEANON THEY'RE PUTTING KNIVES INTO MY SKIN"" and even ""LEANON STOP SHOOTING ME WITH YOUR GUNS"". i'm not even joking guys, it does not stop ever from this point onward. so anyway, i won't spoil the rest of the game for you ;D but ye, you spend the rest of it rescuing her after her getting kidnapped over and over again, kind of a pain but you know, there's titty physics so 10/10 game overall even if you are actually the bad guy working for the bad guy the whole time.",Recommended

"Still the best horror game of all time. The tanky control scheme makes more sense on PC.\n\n""Morir es vivir, morir es vivir"" No scene in a videogame has stressed me out more than the water room. Good grief.",Recommended
"Game sucks on so many levels. It's a mystery why anyone likes it.\n\nFirst off, the camera. That type of camera was done in many games, and never has it been that  bad. Leon covers roughly 30% of the middle of the screen and the camera is apparently attached to his feet because you get his entire body in the frame, the camera is locked directly in front of him, rather than recentering after a while like pretty much all good third person games do. The aiming controls exactly like Deadrising, except you got the shakes on top of the stiff unusable aim. Also there's film grain you have to mod out because the game gives you a headache otherwise\n\nThe enemies are all boring. The ganado just exist for you to use all your ammo on, which you never run out of, so they exist to be a waste of time. The chainsaw men just get pinned to the floor by the shotgun, but you have to sink like 6 shots into them because a weaved bag over your head is apparently better armor than the actual suits of armor.  The crossbowman just serve to make you take damage if you don't abuse line-of-sight mechanics. Honestly the only challenge you'll encounter is the House of the Dead shit-throwers that just throw their weapons at you and you can shoot them out of mid air like you were playing House of the Dead. Early on in the game the enemies just get a random chance to sprout a second head if you kill them. It doesn't make them harder, it just serves to make you use more ammo. The blind knife men are alright. They hear you if you run and they hear you if you shoot. However you have the magnum by that point so just being behind them means an instakill. The shield guys also would work great if you couldn't just kill all of them with one sniper shot. And I do mean all of them, they always line up and their shields don't block sniper shots so you can ge triple kills often. I haven't had a chance to see the regeneradors yet, but from what I understand they're just chainsaw guys that you need a rifle to kill instead of a shotgun.\n\nThe bosses also suck. The Big Boss Bass never even attacks you, you just take potshots at it with a harpoon until it dies. The Troll in the Dungeon bosses pretty much just require you to have ammo because you beat them by walking between their legs, shooting them, repeating until they fall over, QTE their spaghetti then repeat it 2 to 4 times depending. You fight them alot too, I think I fought 4 so far. The fake eye guy does nothing too. He walks at you like a common enemy until you shoot him in half, at which point he's still just a common enemy but now he's attached to one of the 6 beams on the ceiling. The Right Hand is pretty much just a question of ""Have you looked at the cans before the fight?"". You freeze him, you shoot him, you repeat it for 2 canisters, you win, there's no challenge because all his attacks are dodged with QTE. Even if you didn't know that, the guy is going all Adam Wesker on the screen so you know you can shoot him.\n\nThe scenery is boring. Have you played Return to Castle Wolfenstein? Then you've seen all this game has to offer.\n\nThe gameplay isn't great either. You could either run past all of the enemies because they're all designed so they can only hit you as long as you're trying to shoot at them, or you could use your shotgun, round them up in a nice pile, and fire one shot to kill all of them at once. Every other gun serves only as a replacement when the shotgun runs out of juice, except for the magnum, which is for killing bosses. Then once you did that, you have to just run around hitting the improperly colored decor items, because they're breakable if they're not the right color. Then you sell it all to the merchant. There's barely any real puzzles, although there are puzzles. There's a matching puzzle, where you have to match the shadows to the drawing, there's a sliding puzzle, where you have to slide a picture into the right position with 1 square missing, there's a weighting puzzle, where you have to remember you can tell Ashley to wait on the platform to open the door, there's a ton of shooting puzzles, where you have to figure out what to shoot in the environment to proceed. Basically, puzzles for 12 years olds or Legend of Zelda players. Sometimes they don't even bother with a puzzle, you just have a riddle and then you press 2 switches or you put 2 objects on a pedestal and that was the puzzle.\n\nThe characters suck. You have Leon, which looks like that kid you had in high school, that was bullied by absolutely everyone on account of the fact that he looks like Leon, you have Ashley, which you just spend the entire time you have her hoping she dies. She doesn't, as far as I can tell, she just gets captured over and over. But it's almost like she died when you're finally rid of her. You have Carlito. He's just Carlito from Dead Rising except he's not a terrorist, so he's way less cool. You have Ada. Not really though, she appears like 3 times to tease the fact that she's in the game. Saddler is boring. I mean really boring. Salazar is a weird midget. Except it doesn't really matter, he acts identically to a person that's tall, so there's no point to him being a midget. Actually he reminds me alot of Frieza. At the point I'm at they teased some Wesker looking dude with a beret. I'm gonna assume it's Wesker.\n\nIf I'm being honest, the game would have been better as a House of the Dead title. It works so much like a rail shooter. The enemies take a ton of shots to die, you can shoot projectiles out of the air, the bosses don't do much and you have to stand still to shoot.",Not Recommended

"Father, forgive me for I have sinned.\n\nI did not play Resident Evil 4 until August 2017. A cardinal sin I know, but before you sharpen your pitchforks and light your torches, it has rocketed into my top 5 games of all time. I was uncertain as to how to approach it, as I didn't want to hype it up too much in my own head. However, I am overjoyed to say that it was the fantastically enjoyable experience that so many others have reported. \n\nIt starts off as almost a self-aware B horror movie, a theme which runs for the entire game. It almost feeds from this for plot elements which seem almost familiar, but which are laid out in an entertaining and engaging story. It is well paced, starting slow, and then building quite literally up to an explosive climax. \n\nThe level design is superb, with many different environments being explored - the castle level being a particular favourite. At the time the inventory system was innovative and it still shines to this day, from which other games could earn a lot.There is also great replayability, with additional levels and stories to play, an arcade style minigame and many unlockables to enjoy. \n\nMost of the readers will be familiar with the above and if you haven't played the HD edition I would thoroughly reccomend it. For those rarer breeds who are new to the game such as myself, dont hesitate. Play it now!",Recommended

"Resident Evil 4. A game that i enjoyed playing for multiple reasons, such as everything the game offers for the user to play. The game is focused on a special agent who is on a mission to save Donald Trump's daughter. It has multiple pros such as the gameplay and the challenges the game presents and the detail focused on making the enemy strong and smart and getting shot by allies if you annoy them in anyway. I wouldn't recommend this game if you hate to save a constant pain in the ***, (aka Ashley).\nConclusion: Game Is Hard and Enjoyable.\n",Recommended

Very weird, considering that some of the cutscenes between those are identical.\n\nAlso, it's the most fun I've had with aiminig with Steam Controller's gyro.",Recommended

"This was my first Resident Evil game that introduced me to this franchise. I spent more time on it than with classic RE games, ""back in the days"".\nVery little time spent on RE2. Much more on Nemesis. \nThis one was first modern RE game. \n\nNew and better camera, lack of those annoying door opening cutscenes, good inventory system, some action etc.\n\nWhat i don`t like about it is plot. One of the worst in whole RE franchise. Who da fock is Saddler and Sera. What about this Las Plagas? Did devs cared about plot at all? ""Let`s use popular character from previous game and make something new and unrelated to other games"".\nI do understand that RC was destroyed and it was time to move on. It feels like a different game.\n\nI do like weapon upgrade system and better mercenaries mode.\nI also love that it has extra campaign from another character perspective.\n\nGood combination of playable characters in Mercs mode. Krauser with mutation, Hunk with OP neckbreaker, Wesker with his... i dunno... push move?\n\nThis game is one of the few that i still have on PS2.\n\nSpeaking of port.\n\nIt has PC gamepad and keyboard button promts.\nIt has mouse support, but it`s not very good.\nIt has HD textures, but they bad in reality. Modders did a much better job with textures.\nIt has 60 fps. Not good at all. It`s broken!. The worse part was QTE in mines and lack of compatibility with some mods if you use 60 fps.\nIt has laggs. I can run RE6 without problems on high settings. This game laggs sometimes. Maybe not too much, maybe even not very often, but still laggs. Depends on your PC.\n\nPositive review only for the game itself. Port is less than average.",Recommended

"I hadn't played this game since the Gamecube version came out.  It's still a masterpiece, though it took me a little while to get used to mouse and keyboard controls.  I could've gone controller which would feel more natural given that's my history with these games, but mouse is just too superior for shooting games to give up.\n\nI wish they had redone the textures like they did for the REmake remaster on PC, though the good news is there is a community mod that has 2/3 of the game done like that as is ( re4hd.com ).  They did remaster the audio and even the cutscenes, at least for the main story mode.  Seperate Ways is the original low-res video, I haven't played Assignment Ada yet but I have to assume it's the same there.\n\nGets pretty hard in some areas, even for mouse and keyboard.  I was amazed that I ever managed to beat this with a controller back in the day - which I did, many, many times - just because of how quick and precise you had to be with aiming, swapping weapons, keeping an eye on Ashley, etc.\n\nAnd as for Ashley - I didn't understand the complaints about her when it was a fresh argument, and I don't understand it now that I see it got revived with this HD remaster release.  I had her get carried away once and that's because I was stupid (as soon as I entered the Castle, I left her at the entrance in the first big Zealot room, and she got grabbed by enemies that spawned back there and the getaway was two steps away), and I had her die once because I was stupid (I shot through her to headshot a zombie because I forgot she took damage from Leon, so she died there but I never made that mistake again).  Aside from that, I had no issues with her.  She's used for one of the coolest elements of the game (where you take control of her for a sub-chapter for an old-school Resident Evil styled section), so I don't see how anyone can really complain.\n\nSince this is the Ultimate HD Edition, you get the base game, and when you beat that you unlock three modes: Seperate Ways which is a 5ish hour long campaign where you play as Ada, Assignment Ada is a 30ish minute campaign where you play as Ada, and you also unlock The Mercenaries, which is basically a Horde mode, except Resident Evil was doing it before Horde mode became a thing (first doing it with Resident Evil 3: Nemesis - why isn't that, 2 and CVX on Steam yet???), so you get to see how this mode inspired a practical staple in most shooters these days.\n\nThis game is just great, unfortunately there isn't anything else like it to recommend.  The closest thing is Evil Within - the spiritual successor to Resident Evil 4 - but I played it shortly before playing this, and it's an entirely different game.  I don't want this game to ever have anything change but better resolutions, improved textures for those resolutions, and increasingly clean audio.  The way it plays is absolutely perfect for how this game was designed, it's a masterpiece, and one of the great things about games is that you can take masterpieces and make them even better without doing any damage to the source.  What other art can you do this with?  Sure, Capcom could've done more here, but this is a few steps beyond simple preservation, it still feels great even in 2017, and I'm definitely going to play this again in the near future.",Recommended
"My favorite M rated single player only game. In the original Gamecube version, which (has far less content than this and a lot less replayability as well.) I put over 120 hours into discovering basically everything it had to offer, from glitches, to tactics only a the bravest or most suicidal would think of, to finding a bunch of easter eggs you had to get out of the map to find. I could Striker boost to find hidden items and cutscenes, knife a giant with a double bladed chainsaw like it was nothing, and even find the only guaranteed Minethrower ammo in existence. To say the added campaign and HD graphics are not one of the best selling points to this great game is to say you are not a fan of even more fun.\n\nLets start with the cons.\nPort-exclusive:\nA few hardware and software issues for certain OSes and GPUs as if we don't all play PC games and know sometimes this happens to us.\nThe inability to access subtitles when playing in English.\nThe fact you NEED a controller for this. Unlike Resident Evil 5 and after, the mouse and keyboard controls suck more dick than me on a Wednesday.\nGameplay:\nNothing,\nStory:\nDid you say something?\nGraphics:\nWell there was that one pixel I saw like 20 hours ago I think. I don't remember.\nBugs:\nYep, this game has a lot of em. They nasty and like half yo height.\n\nPros:\nGameplay:\nWeapons are always fun to use and the exclusive upgrades give off the great feeling of no objectively greater weapons. Killinng is fun, satisfying and varied, especially in Mercenaries. Aiming is slightly improved from the original, which is always great considering it was never bad on a controller. Modding is now a thing, it was in the original PC version too, but now you can add a bit more polygons and texels, which are always fun.\nStory:\nNo, it's not horror. It's something far better. It's something whiny people forget games and movies should always put ahead of their genre. And that thing is an amazingly entertaining ride of rapture and fun. Whenever I try to see someone complain about how this game ruined the series survival horror aspect. My ears and eyes get immediately distracted by the cheesy dialogue that could make Commando look like a J.R.R Tolkein Novella which makes me giggle even today. The fact I am in charge of this escort mission as much as I want. (Oh sorry Ashley, I couldn't hear your shouting about my perverted self over the huge amount of buckshot I loaded into your now armorclad panties. Also I have a nice hat). Oh, and the fact we have the best merchant in videogame history. This game also introduces to us another great videogame character. Everyone in the game. Ashley may be annoying, but she is annoying in gameplay only, and it's only bad for that for one playthrough. She's great once you can take her everywhere as your indestructible human punchingbag.\nGraphics:\nThey're not going to win any awards today. But they don't have to. It's a slightly better version from before. And Leon looks better in here than he does in 6. Probably due to the fact the lighting isn't trying to be super detailed on hair that is ungodly disgusting. I mean, 5 looked fine, and that crazy guy had similar hair, you can't tell me you saw that shit and thought, well, it is good when Leon from 4, and everyone in 5 looked much better. While 5 and 7 are definitely much better looking. As are the HD port of Revelations and Revelations 2. Leon still looks great, plus as I said in 6 he looks terrible.\nBugs: There are a lot of em. And they are all fun to use or kill. Depending on whether they are alive or something to do with shotguns and jumping in pixel perfect spots.",Recommended

The story is great, the gameplay is great. This was over-the-shoulder-action Resident Evil at its peak. The others didn't come close to capturing it. Amazing...\nThe quick time events are aids though, you've gotta be like the flash mixed with one of those concrete drill things to climb up from ledges.",Recommended
"Resident Evil 4 is the kind of game where you envy someone going through it for the first time.\n\nThe main thing that sets this game apart from the classics is how enjoyable it is to play. It's fun and challenging in all the right ways and though the classics were good they were nothing like this. Whenever I play a good game I set it aside and tell myself I'll come back to it but with this one I had to continue playing right away after I had finished it. I wanted to. That's very rare since I tend to be very thorough when I play games. I couldn't get enough of this.\n\nYou are thrown into this world, you don't know why people are hostile and you can't communicate with them or even know what they are saying. All you know is that they're dangerous, scary and don't like you very much. The opening level is the best and most suspenseful opening level I have ever played. The game tells you ""They want you dead, here's a gun, survive."" I think that's excellent survival horror.\n\nThere are many things that can be said about Resident Evil 4 and they've all been said before so I want to mention the thing I liked about it the most. The pacing. I have never known pacing like this, it's impeccable. Every single level is more intense than the last and there's always something new with every step. The story, the plot twists, the mystery of the characters and their motivations, it pulls at all the right strings so that you never feel bored while playing. Even most of the puzzles felt like they made sense within the lore of the game instead of being there just because it's a video game. And the escort mission part was the best I've ever seen. Ashley never gets in the way because she's always behind you and if you aim your gun in her direction she ducks immediately.\n\nA large part of what makes it so much fun is that it never takes itself too seriously. A sense of humor is always present in Leon with his cheesy one-liners and cocky attitude. The game obviously took a lot of inspiration from Metal Gear Solid in that way, right down to the codec. There's even a nonsensical lava room at one point and it's all so wonderfully campy.  \n\nI recommend this game to anyone, even if you don't like playing video games. Because if Resident Evil 4 can't change your mind, very little can.\n\nRest In Peace, Mike. You were the coolest dude in the whole Resident Evil series.",Recommended
"Both Leon and Ashley are interesting characters, and I enjoy the jokes that Leon makes. Escorting Ashley feels almost like babysitting. I generally don't enjoy escort missions in games, but Ashley needs you to catch her when jumping from a high places when she is standing right next to a ladder. She is completely usesless. The game relies way to much on quick time events. The rocket launcher should not be a purchaseable item because many bosses can be killed just by using it in the beginning. The red dot sight was a fun feature that should be in all Resident Evil games. Overall it is a good Resident Evil game.",Recommended

"Resident Evil 4 is a third person shooter with a long singleplayer campaign that still holds up. It brought more action into the RE franchise, albeit supposedly with less horror elements, and introduced the typical RE controls of 4,5 and 6.\n\nSteam's version increases the frames per second cap from originally 30 to 60, which is very much appreciated. It comes at a cost though. The weapons reload animations are still capped at 30 FPS somehow. And since the number of frame is doubled, you can have some problems finishing some quick-time events of which of them are plenty. There is no problem with QTE where you only have to press a combination of buttons once, but when you have to smash them constantly. If you experience some problems, it's adviced to 1. go to the main menu and 2. to change the FPS cap to 30. 3. Play until you find the next save and save the game. 4. Go to the main menu to change the FPS to 60 again. Also, Steam's version finally fixed the slow mouse aim that had negative mouse acceleration! If you are unsure if you have the right settings, go to the options ingame to check if the mouse is set to modern.\n\nDespite sharing its name with those horrible RE movies, some RE games are actually quite good. If you like horror games, you should try out the first RE games. If you like a good singleplayer campaign, I'd advice you to play RE 4 and if you like a good RE coop game, buy RE 5. RE 6 does feature coop, too. But the game's quality is much lower, to be honest.\n\n++ no stationary camera like in the older RE games\n+ good atmosphere\n+ many weapons\n+ upgradeable weapons\n+ graphics look a bit dated, but do their job\n+ fun and charming\n+ many boss fights\n+ inventory system. an herb isn't taking as much space as a rocket launcher like in RE 5\n+ not dated despite its age\n+ campaign is of good length\n\n- sometimes exaggerated, but less so than 5 or 6\n- many escorting missions for a damsel in distress\n- the retail version is supposedly easier moddable\n- no hotkeys. You need to open your inventory to change your weapon\n- reported problems on W10 systems\n- linear\n- sometimes too cheesy\n- no character development\n- controls take time to get used to\n\nReplay value: average (linear, fun, no coop)\nRating: 8/10\nRecommendation: Yes\nWorth: about 10 bucks",Recommended
"Too many bugs currently, fix one thing and something else pops up; it's either slow motion or stuttering audio. Considering it's happening to many people as well, it's just not acceptable to take a game and then make it worse for people. And those saying that it's all okay because it's a port, while that may be Recommended there was already a Resident Evil 4 released on PC back in 2007; it looked basically as good and ran absolutely fine.\n\nI'm not just complaining and hating, I do love this game and the idea of a 'HD' remaster but it's still not very 'HD'. A few textures have been sharpened and cleaned up but that's about it; slap on some post-processing effects and some terrible motion blur and colour filters and it's apparently 'HD'. It's so terrible infact that it's made pointless.\n\nSolution:\n\nBuy/Download 2007 PC release of RE4 and use a fan-made HD mod which looks better than this current release anyhow; it'll look and run better.\n\nEdit: Is tolerable with much tinkering, but still can't bring myself to recommend this game in it's current state unfortunately.",Not Recommended

I know this version has release long time now but i can't believe they didn't fix one of section of QTE in the game only because the 'HD Edition'. I'm really glad that i didn't waste my money on RE5 because it also have problem at Final part play as Sheva.\n\nIf you have played this on ps2, no need to explain but if you new here, buy this than RE5. There nothing wrong in RE5 except the QTE. If you bought RE5, prepare for the rage on final part especially playing Sheva.\n\nJust like from ps2, it a 3rd shoulder view survival horror game in HD but quite the same graphic as original does.

Re4 was only 5$ and I had only heard good things about it from people. So i got it, and I don't regret my purchase at all. While the townsfolk hunting you down aren't paticularly scary it's the number of how many face you. The feel is so perfect as they keep piling in on you as you use your last bullets and try to push down ladders and many other objects just to get to the other part of the level. The bosses are great and so far I have faced the first 2 which were both hard and fun to face. I haven't got that many tech issues either. This is just an awesome game where the townsfolk themselves aren't scary, but the sheer numbers of them and their dedication in killing you.

"This is my favorite game from a play station 2 era. The level is fun and has a good balance between enemy and the amount of ammo you have. However, the control is bad for me. I have a lot of trouble moving arond. The control made it impossible to make a sharp turn or fluid movement. I hate to say this but I have a hard time plaing this PC edition. The balance between keyboard and mouse (camera angle) movement is not good. The mouse can be adjusted to moved faster but the keyboard that control Leon's movement can't be adjusted. That's the big issue that I have so far. \n\nfor the bright side, I notice that the graphic is improved - Only the texture of course. What's was a low-polygon stay a low-polygon.",Not Recommended

"Surprised to see so many recent positive reviews of this game. I'm sure it was great back when it first released and stuff but it really didn't age well in terms of mechanics. The controls are truly terrible and it really is something that they could have fixed when they went through the trouble of remastering it. No strafing and having to turn your character with A and D is something that designers understood were bad design back in the 16 bit era already and no moving whilst aiming so no moving and shooting? What's that about? On top of it being terribly frustrating it also constantly breaks the immersion of the game because it's just plain unrealistic that a grown man can't lift his hands whilst moving his legs.\n\nSo unfortunately no, I really cannot recommend this game to anyone who has gotten used to playing modern first or third person shooters, which would be most people.",Not Recommended

"Ah, Resident Evil 4. I grew up playing Resident Evil series so you could say I'm a big RE fan. \n\nI still remember the day when I came home from school just to see a DVD case with RE4 picture on it laying down next to my PS2. My dad got it for himself, needless to say I was the one playing it all the time. I immediately fell in love with the game, with it's new fresh look, camera behind a character, quick time events (don't really like quick time events anymore though), and more actiony type. It was a perfect blend of horror/action for me at the time. Sadly the series became more action like and less survival horror which i don't like at all. Capcom tried to get the series back to it's roots with RE6 to at least some extent but it lacked the ""umph"" for me. \n\nCan't wait to start playing it again.\n\nEdit: I forgot to mention something that I really like. Unlockables, new skins, weapons and modes whenever you finish a game or a mode.

"Excellent (must buy)\n[h1] Good  [/h1]\nAverage (maybe when on sale)\nAvoid (not worth your time and money)\n \n[h1] Summary	[/h1]\nA re-release of one of the best Resident Evil games. This has very varied and exciting level design but is let down by being less than the ‘ultimate HD’ edition advertised. Main story takes around 12 hours to finish.\n\n[h1] Review [/h1]\nThis was considered a classic when it was released for the Gamecube. Does it live up to that high regard today? For the most part it still does. The level design remains more varied and exciting than other 3rd person action games.\n\nAs with previous Resident Evil games it borrows themes from classic horror movies (such as ‘The Thing’) but also becomes more action focused (‘Commando’) in the final third. The style of the game is similar to other Japanese action games such as Devil May Cry. It focuses on gameplay at the expense of story.\n\nThe gameplay has changed significantly compared to the older RE games. The levels are more linear and your objective is always marked on the map. Puzzles are easier and are only really used to break up levels. The over the shoulder camera is used to make shooting more dynamic and the main focus of the game. There is a large variety of weapons, enemies, quick time events, melee attacks and environmental hazards to make situations feel different. You cannot move and shoot so the gameplay is slower than other shooters but it still feels satisfying to take out large groups of enemies.\n\nAs well as the 10+ hour main game there are 2 extra stories for Ada that adjust and reuse levels from the main game as well as the mercenaries mode. This is an arcade mode with a time limit where you use different characters to play for high scores in arena levels.\n\nThe main drawback is the technical side of the game. This is a port of a console game and there is no optimisation for PCs. It runs at higher resolutions but I experienced some slowdown when playing at 60 FPS which was disappointing. There are no advanced graphics or sound settings in the game. You can make some improvements but this is through ini settings and mods.\n\nOverall a decent port of a great game, however, It’s hard to recommend if you’ve played before and are looking for a definitive edition.\n",Recommended

"+ satisfying gunplay\n+ challenging but never unfair\n+ good sound-design\n+ I mean come on: it's RE4. It was great and still is great.\n\n- MASSIVE technical problems including, but not limited to: ""HD""-textures that still make the game look like 2005; mouse support only directly in game and only really when targeting, not during menus; sound glitches; framerate differences between cutscenes and gameplay and worst of all: massive framerate drops for no apparent reason (you can circumvent those in the config which, however, comes at the price of the game randomly crashing)\n- still the old soundmix which sounds rather muffled and lo-fi by today's standards\n\nIs RE4 a great game? Absolutely. Should you play a version of Resident Evil 4? Yup. Just make sure it's not this one. This is the SECOND time Capcom botched a RE4 port with the PC-version of the original back in 2007 also being beyond saving. And hey: if you unofficially suggest to use the HD texture pack that fans made....yeah. \nThe console versions on PS3 and 360 are fine, just do NOT get this botched PC-port.",Not Recommended

Resident Evil 4 was a great experience and really was tense at a lot of moments. In this game leon actually is very likable in a cheesy cool guy way instead of like in the newer games where he is just GUY WITH GUN and thats it. The game doesnt take itself seriously and is very silly. The gameplay is fun and its incredbily tense when you're limited of movement causing most incounters with many enemies to be intense. Personally was a really fun time.,Recommended
The best game ever.,Recommended
"Resident evil 4 is an amazing game which started out different and cheesy but then got way better. It maintains the cheesy and corny aspect throughout the game, but for some reason it works really well. Better than any game I've come cross. The action is pretty great and the controls are also great. They take a bit of getting used to, but once you do they are fine. At first i was getting motion sick because the controls weren't what i was used to, but afterwards i was fine and could play for longer periods of time.\n\nMy only problems with this game were really the quick time events. The game would make you rely on mostly shooting and running around getting things, and very rarely did quick time events happen, yet when they did it was always the continuous mashing of buttons, as well as changing the buttons. For example, you're running around shooting all the infected villagers, and you killed them all, so you're collecting ammo and such. As you go down a path the townspeople drop a boulder and have it toll down the hill chasing you. It tells you to mash the buttons Q and E and you mash and mash and mash, and all of a sudden it switches to Press R and then T, but it doesn't give a clear warning, so you die. You try several times more and die each time as well, so you pay closer attention, and tehn see that they hosed you. I know it sounds like I'm complaining a lot about a little thing, but it was my only problem with the game. I wish they gave you a warning or didn't make it utterly stupid when they switched to quick time events.\n\nAnyways, this game was a lot of fun and i enjoyed it immensely. I encourage every resident evil lovers to play this because it's so unique and even if you're not a resident evil lover i encourage you to play this game. I spent about 24 hours in game and i loved every minute of it(except for the quick time events)",Recommended

"Resident Evil 4 or Biohazard 4 as it's known in Japan is a survival horror game with light action elements. It's a classic, you've heard about this before and for good reason. The plot is rather campy with a lot of B Movie influence, but it really plays off this well with charismatic characters often putting a light hearded spin on dire situations. The gameplay serves to put the player in control, but making it just a bit bulky so you never feel too powerful and really feel the strength of the enemies you're up against. The sound design definitely works in favour of RE4, where guns are loud and pack a real punch, while melee attacks are cruncy and visceral. Everything just works in RE4 and when brought together as a whole, it provides a game with a lot of content (A 16 hour main campaign, 4 hour long extra campaigns and the added Mercenaries mode which can be replayed) and a worthwhile campaign. \n\nAll in all, I'd say this game is as close to perfect as you can get. It's a fun game, with a fantastic story and memorable characters. I'd give this a hearty reccomendation and anyone who is even remotely intrigued should give it a go!\n\nEDIT: Do note the extra campaign has FMV cutscene renders from the PS2 game, so they'll be in an extremely low resolution and it doesn't come with English subtitles.",Recommended
"[h1]This is a good game[/h1]\nDon't get me wrong: this game is more than a good horror. Basically RE4 is a synonym of an excellent survival-horror.\nYou have got here all crucial features of well-made representative of the genre with an appropriate amount of an additional content. [spoiler]Don't bother to think of how did cultists lock the door while only the chief of village had keys  or why all of the main roads to the bosses in the game got blocked by puzzle walls which can be unlocked only by collecting different items which are scattered in the most distant and deepest places of location. I don't consider illogical features of the gameplay as a con because they exist in all RE games (canonical ones) so this is one of the factors that make up RE universe.[/spoiler] \n[h1]Optimize the fucking game before releasing it[/h1]\nThis game can probably win an Oscar in the bad optimization. I have never seen so unoptimized game in all of my life. I don't recall how many times I got crashed from the game and got stuck unmovable being unable to do anything but quit the game. Amount of various bugs I encountered in the first place is huge. Official description states that the game runs in smooth 60 FPS but it never did, FPS always jumps. If you switch max settings in the game game will start  to run in slow motion constantly. If you switch most of the settings to minimum you'll encounter slow motion too but more rarely. The game also provides the player with a qualitative audio-stutter. You can get rid of the audio-stutter by switching versions of the game but the game will start to crash more often. To achieve at least playable state of the game you have to put tremendous amount of efforts though rare crashes and an audio stutter will remain. With all of these beautiful  features not only I encountered but the bunch of other people who made different guides and patches which I followed to make this game at least somehow playable. If you make the remastered edition, please  make sure that everything is all right, check everywhere and everything in order to deliver a qualitative product, make sure that you completed the task, in other case this can happen when you simply make a port from console and put a label ""REWORKED HD EDITION"". I always value the good optimization in the games in the first place and I can't stand the games which are optimized so badly. \n[b]UPD:[/b] My PC meets recommended system requirements.\n[h1]I can't recommend this.

"Once you get used to the controls on the keyboard and mouse, you actually have far more precision while aiming than any other version of the game. This is especially Recommended with weapons that are equipped with a scope, however, there are some control issues elsewhere in the game. \nFor instance, it is quite a chore to sift through menus while using KB&M and quick time events are the most unintuitive they have ever been as half of them use the 'x' and 'c' keys. Additionally, the aiming is dreadfully unresponsive during the Del Lago fight so considering some of the circumstances you might want to use a controller to avoid these issues.\nThe navigation is largely the same as it has always been, since the controls let you navigate using eight inputs on a controller or keyboard you aren't really missing out either way. Also, the mouse lets Leon freely look around his surrounding while not aiming with an increased margin and precision.\n\nMy personal experience caught me having crashes every 15 minutes or so however that was fixed by turning off the on-screen keyboard off, so if you are going to buy don't expect the game to be a 100% flawless port.\n\nThat being said this game is my favourite 3rd person shooter of all time and should definitely be played on one of the 8 or so versions that are out now.",Recommended

"[h1] TL;DR [/h1]\n\nGet it. \n\nRE4 is a great action-adventure game with a horror theme. Overall gameplay is excellent, and reasonably challenging, even on normal difficulty. I would [i] highly [/i] recommend playing with a controller, however, as the mouse and keyboard controls are terrible. Story is great, with an exceptional cast of characters and top-tier one-liners.\n\nIt's the iconic Resident Evil game. Highly recommended.\n\n[h1] The Actual Review [/h1]\n\nRE4 was one of those games that I never played but was always interested in. So I went and bought a controller on the cheap and gave it a shot. Despite being tagged as 'survival horror', it really fits the profile of an action-adventure title with a horror theme. It's the first RE to move away from survival horror and adopt the hollywood qualities that RE5 and 6 were criticized for. The difference lies in pacing. Where 5 and 6 are non-stop hollywood action movies, RE4 still feels loyal to its survival horror roots. There are crazy action sequences, but they're spread out between quiet exploration and tense horror sections. RE4 nails pacing, and does very well in almost every other aspect of the game.\n\n[b] Story [/b]\n\nYou're playing as Leon Kennedy, an all-American hero with a spiffing haircut and a large portfolio of one-liners. You've been sent to save the president's daughter from a shadowy group in rural Spain. The story's premise is a solid setup for a horror title, but it quickly becomes an action-adventure. Honestly, there isn't much to say about the story, at least not without spoiling anything. It wasn't deep or profound, but I still enjoyed the hell out of it, the same way you enjoy an Indiana Jones or James Bond movie. The villains, in particular, were very unique and enjoyable. The writing isn't perfect - there are some cringeworthy lines of dialogue - but as a whole the story delivers. \n\n[b] Gameplay [/b] \n\nLike the story, gameplay is rough in some areas but excellent as a whole. The game is challenging and you're often taxed on ammo, encouraging accuracy and risky melee attacks. Successful kicks and suplexes are immensely satisfying and effective, but there's no good way of executing downed enemies quickly, forcing you to stand ther poking away with your knife, which gets old quickly. Guns are satisfying, especially shotguns and rifle headshots. Weapon progression and upgrades are enjoyable, but it felt like the game gives you the best weapons extremely early. The variety of enemies is also excellent, especially when the game forces you to change your tactics in order to beat a new kind of opponent. \n\nBut I can't say it's perfect. The first tag I see for RE4 is 'inventory management' - a painfully accurate label. The inventory system in RE4 is functional, but not ideal. I often found myself spending more time than necessary rooting through the inventory and reorganizing the location of items. There's also enough room to carry every type of weapon in the game plus attachments, ammo, grenades, and healing, so there's no real decisions to make about what to take with you. That's the overall downside of RE4's progression. It's fun, but not very deep. Ammo can sometimes be scarce, but there's usually a convenient pickup in the next room, or on the body of an enemy. It's overly forgiving and doesn't encourage any kind of strategic thinking about what to carry and what to leave behind.\n\nThere are other smaller issues with the game. PC controls are, in my opinion, almost unplayable without a controller. The last third of the game is also weaker than the first. It introduces a new faction of enemies who are ultimately the same as the previous faction with some tougher sub-bosses. And then there's the escourt mission. A very large portion of the game involves escourting the president's daughter, and although there are mechanics to make the job easier, it's still an escourt mission. Thankfully, the game gives you some breaks on this front and there are lots of times where you'll be separated, but it's still a pain.\n\nThat being said, there's a certain charm to the rough spots of this game. Sure, some things are irritating, but it doesn't detract from the overall experience. Despite certain aspects of the game feeling dated, they don't break the game or ruin the flow. It was still a lot of fun to play and presented a decent challenge.\n\n[b] Visuals and Performance [/b]\n\nThe visuals and performance have aged well, thanks to the inclusion of a high-res texture pack and 60fps for the PC. It's a very polished game; I only found a few bugs or glitches and only crashed once. There is a strange bug that slows the game as if you're playing Max Payne, but entering the inventory fixes it, and it actually came in handy once or twice. Other than that, no real performance problems. \n\nThe soundtrack is atmospheric and fits the game well, but I haven't had the desire to listen to any of the tracks outside of the game. Sound design in general is great, as is voice acting. Honestly, there's nothing to complain about here.\n\n[b] Final Verdict [/b]\n\nIt's a damn fine game and a ton of fun to play. In my opinion, it's worth $20 considering the quality, and it's absolutely worth the buy on sale. Great gameplay, solid story, and a decent amount of replayability through bonus content and higher difficulty. Resident Evil 4 lives up to its reputation.",Recommended

"In the 4th installment of ResidiseR vs. livE TwT Evil, Leon Kennedy is sent by the unnamed president of the United States (presumably the guy from Metal Wolf Chaos) to capture some Howitzer ammunition or something. Upon socially interacting with the various individuals there who don't speak a word of English, he kills about 500 of them in their farm homes. One of them who can speak fine English finally shows up, but really loves his pre-1900 german pistol too much. Through Leon's various attempts to extract information from this individual if he saw any warheads for a Flak cannon, the man informs him that it was actually just a nickname for the president's daughter. Ashley '88mm' Howitzer is then found, rescued, and they get away in the end. That is, until Leon promptly denies the offer to engage in ""overtime"", rumor has it that he acually insulted her with the smuggest grin you have ever seen.\n\nThe game's fun, may have performance issues on some computers, and this really rare bug that nobody ever talks about where the game runs at sub-1FPS when you reach crucual moments involving those invisible bug things.",Recommended

"One of the best in the series, played it on GameCube originally.. Bought it just to play through again... Had some noticeable upgrades since the GameCube version. Always fun!",Recommended
"I played RE4 originally back on the GCN. Before Separate Ways, before the PRL 412. I remember having to switch to a second disk when I got to the island. My game ran at 30 fps, and I loved every minute of it.\nIt was then released on PS2, as a downgrade from the GCN (as in, graphically inferior, no real-time fire effects, simplified enemy AI, etc.). Then it got to Wii, upgraded, and I bought it again (and another copy for a friend). Now, I've got it on steam. 60 fps, bug fixes, updated and more difficult AI, more bonus content. And MODS!?\n\nThis is a major improvement.\n\nIt's a almost completely linear game, but there's so many styles to play. In practice, I have four playstyles. \nI play ultra-conservatively, my first round. I can use anything I want, buy anything I want, to make my job of survival easier. I take my time, explore every nook and cranny, collect every treasure, kill every enemy, and try to survive everything as easily as possibly. This style takes about 10-15 hours to complete, as I go slow and cautious.\nThen, I have my ""mediumish-hardcore"" style. I can only use weapons and items found in the game (meaning Handgun, Shotgun, Broken Butterfly. No rifles. No TMP. For this round, I usually self impose I can upgrade those three weapons only, but no rocket launchers, no tactical vest, and no upgrading my attache case. This playthrough usually takes about 15-20 hours as, smaller attache case means no ammo, means a lot of running around to conserve/pick up. \nI've got another ""just for fun"" style where I use my Infinite Rocket Launcher, Chicago Typewriter, Handcannon, and/or PRL 412 to just mow down enemies like no tomorrow. It's fun, with almost no real chance of failure. Usually, about a 5 hour run, doing just about everything, but taking no time to do it.\nFinally, I've got the Speedrun. Where I run past as much as possible, avoid anything extra, accomplish my goals and only my goals as quickly as possible. I've got my time down to just over 2.25 hours.\nI've tried to do a knife run, but... I'm just not good enough to pull it off. Look up Kai Wii's knife run on YouTube if you get a chance. That guy's got some real skill!\n\nAnd that's just the main game! There's about as much playability with the Mercenaries, Assignment Ada, and Separate Ways all thrown in for good measure.\n\nProbably my all time top 5 games.\n\nCons: \nInfrequent audio studders. Sounds like when an old 16bit game would freeze, but only for maybe 0.1 second. Happened maybe 3 or 4 times first 24 hours or so of gameplay. Never happened on either GCN or Wii versions.\nKeyboard/Mouse controls are horrendous. Get a controller, or you won't enjoy playing.",Recommended

So your often pressing w,a, and d which did not sound so bad to me. It is really difficult and I only played 15 minutes.

"In my opinion this game has aged extremely well (It has been revisited too so that helps), this game was a major change up to the resident evil franchise and introduced a whole new combat system. One of my favorite games ever made I felt it had a nice balance of horror, action and survival which set it apart from similar games of its day like silent hill. One of the only cons I couls see on the PC version was the mouse seemed slow when aiming so I switched to controller, from there I had no trouble but I read you can easily modify the ini to rectify this. I completely recommend this to newcomers to survival horror or as a good start to the resident evil family. 10/10 would peek up ashleys skirt again.\n\nEdit: I might add some of the cutscenes tend to be very grainy, for me it seemed especially so on the separate ways campaign.",Recommended
"I really enjoyed playing this game except for the quicktime events....i fucking hate quicktime events. Its where about 90% of my deaths came from XD. Its a bit more faster paced than the first 2, which made it more of a mix between action and strategy. So hey if your a fan of Resident Evil games, give this one a shot...you wont be dissapointed. Also when you beat the game your get 3 extra bonus games to play through....pretty fun as well and just adds to the story we all love.  so upgrade those weapons and kick some zombie mutant ass and of course save the girl.",Recommended

"Without doubt the best survival horror game of all time, Resident Evil 4 is virtually unrivalled in terms of replayability, storyline, action, suspense and thrills. It is a game that pulls you right into a different world, facing enemies of varying difficulty and strength that you had never imagined before. The survival instinct is there right from the start and right until the end as you often find yourslef outnumbered by your enemies and outarmed as ammo becomes more scarce throughout. There is always something new in each chapter and every move leads to something that you least expect. This game for myself and many others is the definitive Resident Evil game. It doesn`t try to be anything else, it solely provides the ultimate survival horror experience you won`t find anywhere else. Adn the included ""Mercenaries"" mode will keep you entertained for weeks on end. The best computer game I have ever played, my only criticism would be that it will always leave you wanting more, despite at times forcing you to question your own sanity and willpower.\n\n\n10/10",Recommended

While I don't consider this to be the height of glory for the genre, it was definitely when horror started to get really good. Many would say this is the best Resident Evil in the franchise. While I would vote 5 for that; I can't deny that 4 is still good, and it came first, allowing 5 to innovate on many things 4 introduced first. Both of these games also have the best partner systems in gaming, which should have become the standard, but was instead forgotten, even by its own series.",Recommended
best resident evil game hands down. I haven't played 7 yet so I'm not counting that one.,Recommended
"I can't really say anything about this game that hasn't been said. All I can say is that this is one of my all-time favorites and I believe it to be one of the greatest action games ever made. The game still holds up amazingly well 12 years after its release, especially with the small texture updates and 60 FPS action. I've seen some people complain about how the game runs on their PC but it runs perfectly fine on mine, and my PC isn't too high end. \n\nIf you are one of those people that have somehow managed to never play this game - just keep in mind that the controls might take some getting used to when compared to modern third-person action games. Since this game was a pioneer in the third-person action genre, being one of the first to implement an over-the-shoulder view for aiming,  the controls aren't as easy to get into as they would be if it was made today. While some gamers view the somewhat stiff control as a bad thing, I think it is an essential piece to what makes this game great. It adds an extra element of strategy and tension. Since you can't move while aiming, you need to consider the best way to position yourself and when to fire your weapon. If this game had amazingly fluid control, all of the tension, suspense, and strategy present in the combat would be gone. \n\nBuy this game. It's too good.",Recommended

"Kind of a rough port and has some difficulties running on newer PCs but still worth your time. Many people already know this game and for those who don't I'll mention a few reasons why this game great. First of all it's super corny in the most charming way possible. Leon has so many nonsensical one-liners that basically define the ""It's so bad it's good"" saying. Next the gameplay, although it is kind of clunky and definitely dated it's still really engaging and a lot of fun. The best part is difficulty mechanics it doesn't outright metion. If you do really bad at the game or are struggling at a part yhe game will get easier without telling you, and likewise if you are doing a great job it will get more challenging. This is a game that set the franchise in a new direction and is full of charm and creative ideas. What more is there to say? RE4 is an amazing game.",Recommended

I personally much prefer playing this game with mouse and keyboard, guess I'm one of those few aliens on Earth that can play this game better with a keyboard and mouse.\n\nOverall, highly recommand to those who never played RE4, but if you own and played RE4 before, there's not much reason to buy this version.",Recommended

Environments are interesting and fun to explore, and for the most part things don't get stale.\n+Some clever puzzles.\n+Minor bonus content and replayability.\n+Boatloads of classic RE cheesiness!\nAlso, it's just plain fun.\n\nAnd now, some things I didn't like all that much but ultimately are somewhat minor, nitpicky points that may or may not affect you:\n\n-Some parts of this game are hilariously over-the-top (for example, cultists in a medieval castle equipped with rocket launchers and a gatling gun). This point could actually be a negative or a positive depending on your sense of humor.\n-After the halfway point, the game starts to lose focus and becomes less creepy and more silly and stupid. (In terms of gameplay, story, and theme/tone).\n-Quicktime events are used too much (especially some during cutscenes that result in instant game-overs).\n\nOverall, this game is great. I certainly enjoyed it, but hardcore, classic-RE horror fans may not as much. Even then, though, it's a definite good time and an example of solid game design.",Recommended

"[h1]This is the critically-acclaimed best Resident Evil game in existence? Umm ｢(ﾟﾍﾟ) [/h1]\n\nFor a game like Resident Evil 4 back in 2005, I can see why it would have garnered praises at the time. However looking at the game now, it is much easier to see a lot of its flaws. It is a fairly decent game, but I would find it very questionable that it would deserve the ""Best Game of All Time"" award. \n\n[b]Good[/b] (*´▽`*)\n[list]\n	[*] Gun variety. There are plenty of guns to choose from and to upgrade.\n	[*] I love Leon lol XD he's a very humorous, likeable protagonist.\n	[*] Pretty good cast of characters. Whether it's the good guys or the villains, none of them I find boring. Even the merchant is freaking fantastic. Personally I believe he deserves to be in all the Resident Evil games.\n	[*] Pretty decent port, despite some hiccups. \n	[*] It doesn't happen often but there are genuinely scary moments of the game that captures the horror atmosphere in the game just right.\n	[*] Frequent save locations\n	[*] Final boss fight was pretty badass.\n[/list]\n\n[b]Not so good[/b] (๑´╹‸╹`๑)\n[list]\n	[*] I'm not a fan of the camera controls however given the console it was released on at the time (The Gamecube), I can see why the developers used the control scheme that they did.\n	[*] Absence of a proper story/plot. Seriously, was there even a plot or story in this game? \n	[*] O.M.G. (￣ ￣|||) The puzzles. Half of the game is puzzle solving, and they're not even that fun in my honest opinion. I'm thinking it was a way for the developers to pad out the game's length.\n	[*] Babysitting Ashley can be a chore and she's the least liked character. Fortunately she's not always with Leon during the entire game.\n	[*] You can't turn on English subtitles. Only if you set the game in another language. [b][u]WTF![/u][/b] ლ(ಠ_ಠლ) That has to be the most stupidest thing I've ever heard. [b]1)[/b] Audio in games and movies are never perfect for me, so using subtitles to pick up on everything everyone says is essential. [b]2)[/b] That's really a middle-finger to those who have partial hearing impairment.\n	[*] QTEs can be a bitch. There are about two QTEs (Quick Time Events) that are near impossible to pass since you have to press the button at a ridiculous speed. Say goodbye to your controller and say hello to finger fatigue. The reason this is so is because of the game being increased 60 FPS, hence having to press the button at a ridiculous rate per second. Therefore setting the game at a fixed 30FPS solves this problem. Be warned though: 30FPS in this game feels really slow. Also my automated key presser program doesn't work for the QTEs, so you may rule out using automated programs.\n	[*] You're going to need to rely on help or a walkthrough a number of times since a number of puzzles aren't obvious and can make you stuck. Not only that but you'll find that certain bosses can only be killed in very specific ways or else you will be wasting your ammo. Which brings me to:\n	[*] Difficulty. I'm playing on the game's ""easy"" mode and there's a number of times I take notice of how difficult it is for an easy mode. Easy modes usually have you breeze through the campaign, however this game felt like the normal mode of any other game. The fight with Salazar literally had me use ALL of my ammo and [b]he still wasn't dead![/b] (This pertains to bosses only being able to be killed in a specific way).\n[/list]\n\nFor a game made in 2005, my rating is: \n[b]8 / 10[/b]\n\nWithout any leniency, I would honestly give it: \n[b]6 / 10[/b]",Recommended

I would say probably. The mouse and keyboard controlls are actually pretty damn good. They take some getting used to, but after that they're fluid and intuitive. Except the menu controls. I have no idea why they decided to switch everything around so drastically for the menus, but the controls for the menus aren't great.

"TD;LR:  As a game, Resident Evil 4 is cult classic and a very rewarding survival/horror experience that needs very little explanation.  As a port and “upgrade” to the original experience, the game does mostly right and a few wrongs, but overall it is a better game because of it.  Updated graphics, a 60 FPS experience, and some other, more minor details have brought this game up to modern standards from its PS2 days.\n\n\nI don’t consider myself a fan of the survival/horror genre, especially of newer titles which, to me at least, rely on appalling amounts of gore, cheap jump-scares, and cliché gameplay mechanics.  This game was an exception, being the only survival/horror I had played for a time.\n\nResident Evil 4 is (broken record warning) a survival/horror game placing you in the shoes of Leon Kennedy, a survivor of Raccoon City, who has been tasked with finding the president’s daughter.  The game emphasizes resource and hit management as ammo and health items are uncommon and rewards exploration which can result in finding more of these items and then some.\n\nThe game starts you off with some basic items, a handgun, some ammo, and a med kit, and immediately places you in the middle of the action.  Combat must be done quickly and precisely as allowing yourself to be overwhelmed is a quick way to end the game and wasting all your ammo will have you resorting to the knife which is not an easy experience.  Items like weapons and your inventory are upgradable, so you can make your weapons more powerful and your inventory larger.  The game does a nice balance between regular combat and boss fights, where fighting common enemies is where you should conserve ammo and bosses allow you to be more generous in ammo usage.  The story is told in three acts, taking place in three [i]very[/i] expansive levels with hidden clues, items, and other treasures.  \n\nAs a game, it does survival/horror very well.  The mechanics like limited ammo and massive damage from enemies create a very real fear of death in the game whether you are facing a horde of Ganados or a boss like Salazar.  This fear is what makes Resident Evil 4 so great, in my opinion.  I cannot tell you how many times I had to put down the controller and take a breather because I had come within inches of having to restart the level.  There are not many games that can do that and do it well.\n\nAs a port, this game is done well compared to other ports PCs have gotten in the past.  It actually works, for one (No, I am not referring to a specific port here…I don’t know what you are talking about), and provides a few extra options you would expect from a regular PC game.  Graphics options are limited, putting low-end machines at a disadvantage, and the graphics are not as upgraded as you might expect, though they have been cleaned up.  I recommend a controller while playing this game as the keyboard-mouse controls are a bit unusual and a controller provides a much better experience for this game.  To top it off, the game runs at 60 FPS, but there are other framerate options if you have a weaker machine.\n\nResident Evil 4 does well in both respects and still provides great gameplay.  Veteran players will find the game to be as enjoyable now as it was back in the PS2 days, and newcomers can expect a unique survival/horror experience.  Until next time, GG and Good Hunting.",Recommended
"This is a really, really shitty port of a pretty good game. Note: I am completely used to tank controls and have never had a problem with the controls of this game in the past however, the controller settings in this game is terrible and I couldn't get them to work at all.

"Resident Evil 4 offers a fantastically realised setting, suspenseful gameplay and is a testament to brilliant lowpoly modeling.\nThe sluggish camera movment will take some time getting used to but its really rewarding afterwards. While it keeps its colour pallette rather brown,sepia and greyish, its leveldesign is compelling enough to keep it visually interesting.\n\nResident Evil has always been horror themed but it has also always been over the top enough and populated with really entertaining characters to just be plain fun. Its not a boring heap of negativity as many other horror games can be.\nThis game will get ridicoulus and fantastical as time moves on but it builds its world slow enough for you to suspend your disbelief far enough that you are totally down with fighting 2 giant mutants over a lavalpool somewhere below a castle. :)\n\n...and after you finish the campaign which has really solid runtime, you get to play a few extra modes they threw in there for you.\n\nSo ya, recommendation! \n\nSPOILER TIPP: The bossfights can be a bit tedious, make sure to always invest in an RPG to take them down in practically one shot. :D",Recommended
"I LOVE RESIDENT EVIL 4. :D  Where do i start. From the get go you know your in for a treat.

"In terms of actual gameplay, this ranks as my favorite Resident Evil game.\n\nIt might take some getting used to, it might feel a bit clunky at first, and it has a certain element that's annoying at times (I'm looking at you, Ashley), but it's so, so worth it. It's one of my favorite games of all time and it's just a blast to play.\n\nPart of the game revolves around escorting a character called Ashley, so if you really hate that type of thing, you should know that right off the bat. It does get annoying at times. However, the game does cut you some slack here and there and it's not so difficult that you'll struggle all the time or anything, but it is worth mentioning for those who absolutely hate babysitting an NPC.\n\nUltimately, this game was the one that broke the mold and bridged the gap between pure survival horror and more shooty-tooty action horror type stuff - some of the things that illustrate this is the inventory management and the fact that you can't move and shoot at the same time, which adds to the tension and you can't just pick up every single thing you find. However, it's not as slow as the older games and the combat is much better, so there's a dash of the new line of Resident Evil games in there as well.\n\nOverall it's highly recommended, because despite its flaws it's one hell of a gaming experience.",Recommended
"Resident Evil 4 (Ultimate HD Edition) is an influental part in the RE franchise with which the series took a step towards action, while skipping the often bothersome and goofy puzzles of the classic episodes. The horror is still present despite changing the fixed camera angle view to over-the-shoulder third-person perspective. By doing so, fighting became more intense and while some people may think otherwise, I believe this shift made the RE series even better.\n\nThe main protagonist of Resident Evil 4 is Leon S. Kennedy (the cop from RE 2 - now a special agent) who is searching for Ashley,  the kidnapped daughter of the President of the United States in rural Spain. After finding the girl, Leon discovers a plan of a local cult trying to infiltrate the US government using an ancient parasitic species to manipulate and control people...\n\nBesides appearance, RE 4 is different from the previous episodes in many ways. First of all we control the main character from an over-the-shoulder view, which was revolutionary in 2005, when the game was released. As a matter of fact this was the first game that introduced this perspective, making it popular ever since (think of Dead Space). Its resourcefulness is evident from the start: altough we are still immobile while fighting, we can now freely aim, using the mouse and switch between enemies regardless their distance from us. This allows us to handle multiple enemies at once which we'll need since the game prefers to throw many of them at us at once.\n\nThe second thing is the storyline: while not very complex, it's so full of surprises right till the very end there's hardly any dull moment and will definitely keep us on our toes. The characters - for the first time in a RE game - have personalities (altough Leon's behaviour seems inconsistent at times) and we also get to hear deliberately (!) funny dialogues between them (apparently the cultural differences in humor between Japan and Europe/US have been ironed out this time).\nAdventure elements are still present, there are puzzles to be solved but not as many and time-consuming as there were before and quest related items won't take up important inventory space anymore. There are plenty of traps instead and quick time events which can even appear during cutscenes (yes, we CAN die during cutscenes).\nThe typewriters remained (along with the herbs) but we no longer need ink ribbons to save, backtracking is required though to use them again as they are quite scarce.\nThere's additional content too: we can play through 2 additional side campaigns with Ada from RE 2 [spoiler](but why do we have to kill Krauser before Leon in Separate Ways?)[/spoiler]and there's a game mode called mercenaries in which we earn points by killing enemies (preferrably in quick succession) within a given time (and stay alive of course). By completing it we can unlock the game's most powerful weapon: the hand cannon.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=935641394\n\nThirdly, there are no zombies in RE 4, at least not by conventional means. Mostly we fight humans, but these knife/pitchfork/axe/scythe-wielding villagers and cultist are more frightening and unsettling than the undead from the classic episodes. Fighting the brute(s) from Texas Chainsaw Massacre or the giant lake monster are both memorable moments. And this time, Umbrella is only tangentially involved.\n\nOn the fourth place, there's money (peseta accordingly) with which we can buy a variety of weapons and upgrades from shady traders. This feature also makes the optional replays more interesting as we can experiment with various weapons, discovering which suits our style the best. Even the weakest weapons receive an exclusive boost after upgrading them to the max, so it's not always advised to sell our old guns. \nWe are still unable to buy ammunition though, so saving it and firing considerately is recommended as we can quicky find ourselves standing in front of a boss with no ammo. It's important to mention that whenever we purchase an ammo capacity increasing upgrade, the given gun will be fully reloaded and this can save our lives, so take this into account.\nOn a side note: weapons can't be reloaded in the inventory screen anymore (which felt like cheating anyway :)).\nGrenades are a new addition and are very useful: they are extremely powerful and all 3 of them are effective against different types of enemies. While the flash grenades may seem useless at first, they do come handy against ranged enemies and can also instantly kill those pesky plagas.\nOur trusty knife has also been improved, it became quite powerful (as opposed to previous RE episodes) and can even be used against bosses effectively. Its use (especially against downed combatants) is mandatory.\nLeon has special moves this time: the roundhouse kick and the suplex can both be performed against disoriented or stunned enemies. The kick is perfect to make some space around us when surrounded by enemies and the suplex is a usually fatal move. While performing these, Leon is invincible, so use them often.\nHitboxes are well placed and headshots aren't always recommended as shooting foes in the knee (thus forcing them to kneel for a suplex) can be more rewarding, not to mention other nasty surprises followed by a wrongfully placed headshot...\n\nThe controls as good as they may seem, aren't without major flaws. First of all, Leon is immobile while aiming and releasing the mouse button does not let us move immediately. The second problem is the absence of the autorun function (we do need to run all the time), so that means we'll have to keep a finger constantly on the Shift button (needless to say that it limits our mobility using WASD). While holding Shift we can't use quickturn either: we'll have to let it go for a brief moment (there seems to be a slight delay here too). And thirdly the layout of the quick time event buttons (X and C) cannot be changed.\nSo it will take plenty of time to practice, but even then, we'll never be able to perform such fluid and quick moves as in Dead Space.\n\nThere are bugs in the game, sadly. I noticed that having full health at QTE  events (where we have to tap a button repeatedly) is compulsory, but sometimes the game glitched and I automatically failed regardless (the event never appeared and I was shown the death animation). Only quitting the game and launching it again solved this.\nAnother QTE glitch is related to boss fights where we can still get hit by an attack depending on where we stand.\nSome of these bosses have 'invincible' animations (much like Leon's kick) when they can't be hurt and one must recognize these in order to avoid wasting ammo.\n\nThe graphical update is one of the main features of this PC version but I didn't notice that much improvement over the 2005 original. The character models look sharp and some of the environments as well, but there are some outright ugly textures especially towards the end. The rural and castle areas seem nice but apparently the quality from there took a hit. It's hard to understand why they replaced some textures while leaving others on console quality.\nThe cutscenes however are top quality, but not in Ada's campaigns: for some reason they are extremely compressed and look terrible (even the ones reused from Leon's).\n\nThe music is suspenseful and the sound effects are well made.

"Resident Evil 4 is a great game! I remember playing it on PS2 a long time ago and so far, with the HD textures, it has been an amazing experience on PC. I definitely recommend it for anyone that likes the RE series.",Recommended
"First of all, if you want to buy a Resident Evil game , buy this one first. Why you ask? Simple my friend, simple, this is the best of them all. Resident Evil Remastered is good but the camera angles and the damm puzzles are annoying ( Same goes for Resident Evil Zero) Resident Evil 5 is kinda eh and Resident Evil 6 is just **** , has for Resident Evil 7, well i don't really count it since it looks like a whole different game.\n\nAnyway Resident Evil 4 got all you want, a good story, a bad ass caracter, nice enemies and puzzles (The puzzles aren't too easy or hard, tho i did need to wiki once or twice) + you get a Merchant that has the best voice lines in history for me, even at full price this game is worth it.",Recommended
Probably the best game in the series. It takes a lot of time to get used to this clunky controlls.,Recommended
It's just fun.,Recommended

"Game itself is truly a masterpiece, nothing more to say about it.\nThe PC port itself is acceptable. High-def tectures are working as intended but does not extend to the cut scenes.",Recommended
"This game is a masterpiece, it always has been. \n\nReasons to play this game:\n\nShoot Spaniards in the face, destroy mighty trolls, get eaten by giant lake monsters, stab garden gnomes, get head literally removed by trained surgeon, investigate local Spanish architecture, see the mighty salami monster and ADA WONG.\n\nSeriously though:\n\nExcluding RE2, RE4 is one of the best Survival Horror games there is in the RE Series. It's just difficult enough to make this challenging, but still great fun. Admittedly, the PC port is a bit shit at times; FPS drops, random sound cut-outs, etc. This can all be forgotten, though. \n\nPlease play this game, even if you're not totally au fait with RE, you'll still enjoy this game to pieces.\n",Recommended
this is quite possibly my favorite game ever lol. first game i've played all the way through (i might be a little biased because of nostalgia) but definitley a good game and worth the buy.  good balance between horror and action imo,Recommended
Timeless game. Solid port.,Recommended
"I'm one of the rare that didn't play it back in the time. So after finishing it, I can review it without any pinch of nostalgia.\nFirst thing first is that the visual was really great for the Game Cube, its probably one of the best looking game on cube if not the best. Its grey in a good way and you really feel the dread. Will still remember that castle in the far view behind a mask of fog.\n\nOne of the complaint people have is the tank controls. The only issue I found with it is that its not really smooth and the aim will move by increments, you cant do a full turn with all of the mouse zone. However apart from that, you can take distance then aim, then control the aim, you can also do a 360 flip. You can look around, but dont do that in combat. Dont touch the mouse until you aim, just turn the player where you want to start aiming then aim and you will have a good time.\nOnce you get skilled at it, its hard to really complain, it feels different and different is good. Enemies are also really slow and they get stagger easily. The Devs know you are a tank, so they made all the game slow pace.  What I really hate tho is that there is no way to equip your weapon and grenades by a key, so (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9) serve no purpose. It would be less serious if you dont need to change weapon alot, but you must, mostly near the end.\n\nNow, what I fu**ing love is the ideas. Dude what a ride, they really put all of em. You look at the map and you can tell each sections have their own unique sequences to them. And thank god there is lotsa scary sequences and not just action, good scary sequence. The AI and combat is also better than the standard, way better, they didnt stop only at ''shut head to kill faster''. No, in RE4 its more: Shoot head also to stagger then kick, shoot upper leg to make them fall on knee then suplex, shoot lower leg to make them sleep, shoot the explosiv in guy hand to make it explode, shoot environmental hazard...\nEnemies can wear protection, enemies can dodge, enemies can fall, enemies can open doors, they can leap above things, enemies are varied. All the loss in dynamic and the uncomplex attacks of player is put into the enormous amount of possibilities and hidden gameplay. The lack of player moves is put into a sandbox of small scripted events. The player can for example kick down a ladder to block a path enemies can use. The player can push object to achieve a similar goal. Even the crouch is set at specific trigger zones. Its all the same button. It feels old as a mechanic, but its cool to perform. For that amount of varied moves, you cannot bind them all so they got away with this. Game is easy to start and understand, but the deep is here.\nEnemies encounters also play at best in multi path level design. You have those closed arenas with one way paths, multi paths, ladders, doors, placed enemies, interactive objects, traps, pickups... Its not a big exterior with random art assets and enemies placement, cat and mouse closed gameplay is the bestest. Events can happen, like you can be on a bridge and enemies will arrive on both side makin you a sandwich target. In RE4 those events can be missed which is awsum and they are also varied. \n\nAlso the difficulty is dynamic and its not just damage value, it can even change the number of enemies.\nIts subtle, you dont even know it and this is amazing. To make it best I would have added an option to enable or not dynamic difficulty, but seriously, more games should have this :D",Recommended
"i really wanted to like this. originally played on the Wii, years back. unfortunately, the control for movement and aiming are difficult. it's a constant fight to get the character to look where you want. i actually got motion sick from constantly fighting the camera. people are saying that's how it was in the original game. that may be Recommended, but somehow it seems worse on the new version. maybe it's just me, but i'm not prone to getting sick in video games...\n\nanyways, this is probably this the same great game, but i'll never know. i can't even get to the first village without feeling queasy.   :(",Not Recommended
"Besides RE2, RE4 is one of the best Survival Horror games I have played. My rating is 9.5 out of 10. However, the PC port is not great; there are moments when the framerate drops, causing slow movements or sound effects and voice acting to be out of sync with cutscenes. The only thing I didn't like was a few super hard boss fights that take place in tiny locked rooms. Other than that, this game is INCREDIBLE! It kind of reminds me of the old arcade game: House Of The Dead.",Recommended
"[b] INTRODUCTION: [/b]\n\nIf you went around asking people randomly if they have heard of Resident Evil, you are likey to get the answer yes. From games, movies to comics, the Resident Evil franchise (Created by Capcom) has inticed gamers world wide since 1996 with its effective take on the surival horror genre when it debuted on the PS1. In fact, RE can claim to have largely put the survival horror genre on the map. RE boasts one of the most hardcore and loyal followings there is. I have witnessed fist fights almost breaking out among my own friends when they have a slight disagreement on the lore of the franchise. Resident Evil 4 originally released on the Nintendo Gamecube in 2005. It marked a big shift in the core gameplay mechanics of the franchise from a pivot and turn player movment scheme with an up/down aiming option with auto assist, to an over the shoulder view giving the player full control over character aiming. RE4 also marked the start of a departure from the series norm of puzzle solving being balanced with action segments to being heavily action focused. Also, the player inventory was greatly expanded allowing the player to carry much more than in previous games. These changes sparked a huge controversy and even panic among fans before the game released worried about the direction of their beloved franchise. While many hardcore fans still yearn for the days of the balanced puzzle elements, many agree RE4 was an excellent game, if not the RE game they expected. In fact, RE4 could arguably be the best third-party game made for the Nintendo Gamecube.\n\n[b] STORY: [/b]\n\nI am a very passionate gamer and the story of a game is the single most important factor to me when thinking of a purchase of a single player game. The RE franchise as a whole has one of the most story and lore rich worlds in the gaming industry. Where does RE4 measure among these great games? In my opinion, not the best of the series in this department but intriguing enough to keep me hooked. RE4 marks the return of rookie Raccoon City police officer Leon Scott Kennedy now a government agent newly assigned to protect the US President's family. When Ashley, the President's daughter is abducted, gathered intelligence pointed toward her location being in an isolated area of Spain. Worrying a large rescue team would spook her captors into assassinating her, the President orders Leon in alone in an attempt to bring her back safely.\n\n[b] GAMEPLAY: [/b]\n\nIntense. Action packed. Much different from the previous RE games. What does this mean? It means Leon has gone from a rookie cop to a badass special agent with all of the usual RE weaponry at his disposal and then some. While there are some puzzles to be solved in this RE installment, the player is aware from the start that action will take the front seat, with puzzle and horror elements sitting in the back. This game also introduces The Merchant as the first ''shop'' system in the main RE games to let players purchase and sell items. Regardless of a fans stance on this RE, The Merchant is one of the most liked characters in the RE series even though he has no back story in the game. His trademark voice acting charmed many fans and always manages to spur puns in RE conversations. I never seem to tire of taking on the enemies (Los Illuminados, ganados) in this game. RE4 is the first RE to allow the player to fully free aim so arm, head, leg, torso shots are all possible and the enemies respond accordingly to where they are hit. As long as you make your shots count, the game gives you just enough ammo to get by unless you employ the lower leg shoot and knife tactic by veterans giving you ample ammo.\n\n[b] CONTROLS: [/b] \n\nResident Evil has always been known for its unique controls and RE4 keeps this trend intact. Where the original Nintendo Gamecube control scheme had quite a steep learning curve. This is where the steam version has a distinct advantage using mouse and keyboard is almost always the best control method for shooting based games. Shooting enemies accurately where you wish is a breeze on PC. This is the first RE to broadly implement QTE's (Quick time events) into the gameplay. These may be slightly harder to complete on keyboard for some players but if you are struggling on one you can always plug in a controller to complete it. Still advantage PC.\n\n[b] GRAPHICS: [/b]\n\nResident Evil and Capcom games in general have always boasted cutting edge visuals and RE4 doesn't disappoint. Being released in 2005, the game still looks pretty good on original consoles. This HD release is no full HD remaster, but it surely does look better than the originals barring your PC can run it on max settings. Until we get that remaster, this is the best looking version of RE4 available.\n\n[b] SOUND: [/b]\n\nVoice acting has always been hit or miss to laughable in RE but thankfully it is pretty well done in RE4. Sound effects and musical scores on the other hand have always been a huge strength. From gun shots to rustling leaves, the sound is so good you will feel like you are in the game. While this game doesn't have the jump scare factor of the older RE games, some of the enemy vocalizations especially the Regenerators, will likely send chills down your spine.\n\n[b] OVERALL IMPRESSION: [/b]\n\nDue to this lengthy review, I am sure you can tell I am a fan of RE and RE4 in general. I have played this game on every platform it has released on. How does this version stack up? If you are a PC player and never played RE4 before....what are you waiting for pick up this amazing game. I have to highly recommend it! If you have played RE and are a fan of the series, once again I recommend adding this one to your library. If you have played RE4 before and are not really a fan of the series, I would pass on this one and wait for a Recommended remaster which would be more likely to give you a favourable opinion of the series.\n\n[b] NEEDS IMPROVEMENT: [/b]\n\nThere is still a glitch going around that causes a slow motion effect for some players while trying to run RE4 at the 60fps setting. For most people simply reducing or deactivating anti-aliasing or other graphical settings can allow you to run the game at 60fps. Others like, me were unable to run the game at 60fps at all even though my PC specs were way over the recommended settings. Since the game was originally 30fps, the HD improvement easily is the best graphical improvement for the game over the FPS increase. I would also like to see a permanent price drop for this game. $19.99 USD for a 12 year old game is a little pricey especially since it has released on every console since the Gamecube original. $15 USD would be nice.",Recommended
"Resident Evil 4 is the definitive be all/end all of the Resident Evil series. It is the Coca-Cola of Resident Evil. Since it's creation, not a game before or after in the series has managed to recreate the perfect balanced levels of fun and intensity that RE4 manages to deliver. Short of its aging graphics, it continues to be the pinnacle of survival horror that manages to weave a solid story with solid gameplay mechanics and an amazing atmosphere.\n\nWhile the tank-like ""stand and shoot"" gameplay may feel archaic to some, it adds to the overall ""survival"" aspect of the horror game. Leon is not completely defenseless and you'll find that shooting your way out of trouble is the most reliable strategy, but its Recommended horror lies not just in your vulnerabilities but the slowly shifting strength, number, and design of enemies as well. The definitive version is the Wii Edition in terms of controls, but its also comfortable on Mouse+Keyboard as well as on the controller. While it may behoove some to find other ways to upgrade their experience through mods, the game will continue to stand the test of time as one of the shining examples on how to make a truly engaging and rewarding game.",Recommended
"[h1]Short version: 82%[/h1]\nResident Evil 4 revolutionised its franchise by combining some of the old survival horror elements and the classic RE cheesiness with modern action shooter mechanics—including a shop system and New Game+ runs. Since it offers something for everyone, it is easy to understand its popularity, but its dual nature also came with a price: it cannot excel in either aspects.\n\n[h1]Long version:[/h1]\nResident Evil 4 marked a turning point in the franchise, as it was the first game in the core series that left behind many of the gameplay elements of its predecessors to bring something fresh by introducing mainstream third-person shooter mechanics.\n\nWith this unique duality, RE4 tries to satisfy both the older RE gamers and the newer console-player generation. Both worlds get something—the old-school fans a myriad of smaller recurring elements like typewriter save spots, whereas the more action-craving players can enjoy the weapon upgrade and New Game+ system—but this double nature came with brand new problems.\nThese problems affect old-school players more, as they may find RE4 more of an action game with its linear levels and generous random item drops (except on Professional mode). Action gamers fare better, as their only problem may be the ancient tank controls, which did not really translate well to 3D.\n\nThe brilliance of RE4 lies in its balance. It is clunky as a shooter, but not clunky enough to be uncomfortable for too long. It tends to spawn enemies everywhere, but not in such numbers that the player cannot enjoy some of the level design and atmosphere. No wonder that those whose first Resident Evil was this game remember it fondly to this day.\nThe others… well, they may prefer the purer survival horror of Resident Evil REmake or the better shooter gameplay of Resident Evil 5 instead. Still, if they want to combine both worlds, they can always come back to this classic that probably will never get completely old.",Recommended

"It was really fun returning to this game. Despite its age, this game certainly is a game that aged really well. It was a marvel of its time. \n\nThe pc port has recieved criticism for its controls. I haven't found an issue with controls other than my mouse randomly disconnecting on me often (I dunno if I can pin it on the game or my wireless mouse, my mouse doesn't do that anywhere else). It's just a matter of adjusting the mouse sensitivity and getting used to pressing the Q button to turn around. It didn't have the controls of Dead Space 2, but it was sufficient enough for me and didn't hinder my gameplay experience at all. \n\nAlso, despite my issue of my mouse randomly losing its connection while playing this game, I not only tolerated it, but still have loads of fun playing this game. I hope when I return to this game I'll have a better mouse or something figured out. \n\nI'd certainly recommend this game, I don't see it as a bad pc port at all.",Recommended
"The game is difficult, that's not necessarily a bad thing, but it's not the fun kind of difficult that you get from Dark Souls. It's difficult because the controls are like trying to steer a fat man around in a shopping cart. It may just be a function of the game being sorta old, and I'm sure it could be good if it got an update to a modern shooter control style but until then I probably won't play this unless I feel like getting lynched by slow moving villagers becuase Leon can't move while shooting, reloading, or doing anything really.",Not Recommended

"I guess most people who recommend this game played the original when it came out? It's a guess.\nMy brother played it back then on the PS2, and still goes on about it now, so I thought I'd give it a go.\n\nMy personal view, after struggling through maybe 2 hours (steam says 1 but it felt much longer) of the game is that if you've never played it... let it go. \n\nTime has moved on and the clunky controls are painfully bad. Apparently, the controls were bad on the PS2 he played it on back then so it's not a PC thing; it's just that we accepted cr*ppy controls back then because... back then :)\n\nLooked good as well and I was enjoying the atmosphere, but the pain of trying to control the dude was actually quite claustrophobic at times. \nI don't like being negative but I wanted to add some balance to the reviews on Steam. This definitely ain't for everyone :)",Not Recommended
"This game is pure nostalgia for me. It scared the crap outta me when I was like 12 playing this on the gamecube.\n\nThat being said, the game has not aged well. The controls are similar to the original on a controller, but in the modern age its a really annoying setup. \n\nA lot of games from this era seem to have the same problem. When it comes to a really difficult part, you can either buckle down and do it hardcore, or you can just take advantage of game mechanics. For example, rocket launchers. You get one for free. It turns any boss fight into a one hit wonder. When you fight Mendez, the ""big cheese"", you can either shoot till he staggers and waste all of your ammo - OR - shoot an explosive barrel and use 2 incendiary grenades in phase one, and 3 frags in stage 2. Essentially, you can end the fight in under 60 seconds.\n\nThe game is FULL of beginner's traps. If you haven't played it before or have never seen it played, the games takes HEAVY advantage of that. Pretty much, once you know everything, you can just beat the game on professional and just impress all your friends. \n\nQuick Time Events? OH, BOY! I felt they were cool back then, but now I just find them annoying as hell. Fights with Krauser can be extremely annoying because you basically have less than a second to react. \n\nI will recommend this game in the end. It's fun, easy to stream, and pretty cheap.",Recommended

"[i]83/100[/i]\n\nOften considered one of the best survival horror games ever made, I don't think I need to tell you why [i]Resident Evil 4[/i] is such a great game. Featuring a near-perfectly paced and varied campaign that almost never loses steam and a very entertaining (and silly) story with some fun characters, this is a game everyone should experience at least once. Everything that at first would seem as a design flaw in any other game (such as the controls) works amazingly well here. Top this off with a lot of extras and you got yourself a great game.\n\nThis PC version features some improvements as well as some new issues such as crashing (when alt-tabbing) and the game only being playable in a letterboxed format (this might've just been on my end and is probably fixable somehow) but I do overall recommend it because of the mouse and keyboard aiming. You really can't go wrong with any version of this game (except maybe the original PC version which is apparently terrible).",Recommended
"Resident Evil 4/Biohazard 4 is a third person survival horror videogame developed by Capcom and first released in 2005. The game takes place in a rural European village and its surroundings where U.S. government agent Leon S. Kennedy has been sent to investigate the kidnapping of the President's daughter. Soon enough, Leon discovers that the locals have been infected with a mysterious parasitic virus, Las Plagas, which makes its host incredibly violent and mutates him/her beyond recognition. Therefore, the whole rescue mission becomes a nightmarish experience where Leon must be sure to rescue his charge and leave the place alive and well quickly.\n\nResident Evil 4 was released on different platforms over the years. Steam's version, dubbed the ""Ultimate HD Edition"", and released in 2014, can be considered the last and best of them all, and a significant improvement over the original PC port: it comes with a high-resolution texture packs, improved controls, constant 60fps and nearly all the extra content that was released with the previous versions. The only hiccup of this port is that some cutscenes aren't upscaled to reflect the better graphical quality, so they really stand out as a sore thumb (this becomes really apparent in the Separate Ways campaign, where NOT A SINGLE CUTSCENE has been upscaled).\n\nTo this very day, Resident Evil 4 is fondly remembered for the following features:\n\n1) An increased emphasis on action and QTEs sequences without compromising the survival horror roots of the series. Althought Leon has a wide array of weapons to choose from, can dish out powerful fighting moves on incapacitated foes and can improve his gear and survivability as the game progresses, you'll be outnumbered and overpowered most of the time, many things can kill you cleanly in one hit (the QTEs sequences above all else) and you must manage the scarce ammo, money and available inventory space, unless you'd like to be totally defenseless. The result is an experience where you can feel like a legitimate badass and the controls are fluid and intuitive, but the whole ordeal is still tension-ridden and you can't just go around guns blazing and being careless.\n\n2) A setting and enemies design that may be a far cry from the original Resident Evil games (from American cities and classical zombies to a rural European village, a gorgeous Medieval castle and a nearby island serving as a crude military base inhabitated by people made pale, violent and often ravaged by an ancient parasitic organism), but still manages to be horrific and oppressive enough to keep the player on his/her toes. Same may find these new elements actually more original and engaging than the ones in the previous games.\n\nAnother great feature of Resident Evil 4 is its nice amount of replayability, to the point that finishing the game once on either Easy or Normal may be considered just the beginning on the experience, since, aside from the unlocked costumes and weapons:\n\n1) A new hard mode is unlocked for the main game, Professional\n\n2) You get an extra, shorter campaign named Separate Ways, which features a playable Ada Wong and follows her exploits during the events of the main game. This campaign may be the weakest extra content, since it's generally a reharsal of many things you already did in the game proper, against the exact same enemies, with a playable character who isn't all that different from Leon and is the subject of a passable side story.\n\n3) You get an extra short mission, Assignment Ada, starring, once again, Ada Wong as she tries to extract five Las Plaguas samples around the island while on a weapon and resource shortage.\n\n4) You can now play a hold the line survival, mission-based mode called Mercenaries, where you must kill as many enemies as you can in the shortest time frame possible in different maps. This mode, on top of being rather challenging, features new enemies encounters and allows you to unlock new characters to play as.\n\nResident Evil 4/Biohazard 4 is still considered by many the undisputed Game of the Year of 2005, arguably the best of the ""modern"" Resident Evil games and a terrific and fun game in its own right, even taking into account is rich legacy. Being able to have access to such an excellent PC port thirteen years later is also a great occasion I think no one should miss out",Recommended
"This is the game that tainted the franchise!\n\nAn almost completely linear and action oriented arcade shooter, if it weren't for the RE name I could have easily mistook it for something else. Can it be fun to play? Yes! Is it in any way more rewarding or as scary as the classic entries in the series? Fuck no!\n\nOverall, it's not the RE game I would ever recommend newcomers to the series to play first, but if you absolutely must try every RE title available to you, then RE4 is going to be on your list.\n\nI am still going to beat the game, but it is a poor RE game by any standard, the RE1/Zero HD offerings blow it out the stratosphere! Fingers crossed for a decent RE2 HD remake and if all things go well a RE3 HD remake as well!",Not Recommended
"Resident Evil 4 was a remarkable game, mixing up the style and tone of the previous 3 entries in the series. Technically it's not even zombies anymore as the bulk of your enemies are ordinary citizens taken over by the parasitic creatures known as Las Plagas. In comparison to the slow, deliberate style of Resi 1, 2, 3 and Code Veronica, the emphasis here is a constant stream of action, mostly over-the-shoulder gunplay with a handful of puzzles and escort sections thrown in. It's so satisfying not only thanks to the campy and over the top cut-scenes but also the loop of combat encounters and equipment upgrades giving you a clear path. Once the main campaign is finished (a 10-14) experience you also have the extra campaigns starring side character Ada Wong. In addition the mini-game Mercenaries bring a score-attack based formula to the table allowing the chance to unlock powerful weapons for use in repeat play-throughs. As a full package, Resident Evil 4 is perhaps one of the most accomplished videogames I've played and a high-point for the series. If a great action-game is what you need, I've got something' that might interest ya'. Stranger.",Recommended

"This game is great. I remember getting it on the wii when I was but a wee lad,  but I never finished it because it was too scary for me. I got it on the PC half expecting the controls to be garbage, but they're actually really good (in Resident Evil 4 terms, anyway XD.) If you haven't played this game before, don't worry if the controls feel a little clunky, it's part of the game, and you'll get used to it in no time. \n    You can lock the game at 60fps or 30fps, depending on your preference. I played at 60fps, and there was only one problem I encountered that was caused by using 60fps; the minecart jump and statue escape quicktime events were impossible unless I started mashing the buttons before the prompt appeared. This can be fixed if you just exit to the main menu and lock the frame rate to 30fps, then do the QTE again. After that, you can just find a typewriter(A.K.A save station) and exit to the main menu to change the fps again. \n    Off of that subject, the graphics are nice and the textures aren't blurry. I completed the game in about 16 hours, but depending on how fast you go through it, it could range anywhere from 12 - 17 or something like that. I went through pretty damn slow though! \n    If you want to play even more after you finish, you can start new game +, which starts a new game but with the added bonus of having all of your stuff saved from your last run. There are also some unique items you can only get in new game +, if you're a completionist.\n    The weapons feel great, the gameplay is fun, and the atmosphere is pretty scary at times. In short, go buy this!",Recommended
"Honestly most of the hype in the game is nestolgia factor. Thats one of the only reasons this game is a game i recommend. The earlier games were much better and this casued the seris to be more about action than what the series was originally known for. IE puzzles, inventory managment, jump scares, seclusion, etc. Now this game features higher ammo count, more help, stupid easy puzzles, etc.(NOT TO MENTION THE CHEESY AS FUCK LINES) Capcom began a rapid decline in game quality. 4, 5, 6 should be not cannon to the rest of the series. (all the games that take place in RC). Only play if you like more action or if you're playing for nostolgia. I do and don't reccomend the game.",Not Recommended
"The game's all here, but the controls are no good. Maybe there is an adjustment period needed, but I cannot get over how clunky theese keyboard controls are feeling.\n\nHere I thought it would be better with keyboard and mouse, but nope!\n\nGrab the Wii version instead.",Not Recommended
"I hadn't played RE before #7, so I decided to try ""the best in the series"". Well, I'm glad I didn't try the worst\n\nYour enemy is the controls and the only challenge in the first hour of the game. Most gamers are accustomed to the A and D keys strafing or moving sideways. In RE4 those keys (likewise on the controller) turn the character. The mouse turns the camera, which is locked to movement. See the problem? Turning while looking around is disorienting and snaps the camera around\n\nCombat is awful and I can hardly imagine worse. You can't aim and move. Aiming or readying a weapon locks you in place while you fight the worst aiming system I've ever had the displeasure of using. Mouse acceleration is so bad that real aiming is simply impossible. Acceleration can't be tweaked out. Instead you carefully adjust your hand movement to whatever the character does and hopefully shoot them before taking damage. Run away to avoid the other enemies, and repeat\n\nShooting in the head stuns them long enough to actually kill them with your kick - the deadliest weapon in your arsenal. Here's a tip: DON'T shoot the early enemies in the head. Shoot their legs so they're stunned for longer and you can kick them. I don't even think headshots deal any extra damage\n\nLuckily, the slow and dumb enemies have such an even harder time engaging you that it's kinda fair. But that's not fun. Designing the game around a bad combat and control system doesn't make it work, and contrary to whatever everyone else is experiencing, I can't imagine how it's immersive\n\nThe sound, level design, and graphics are bland and basic. Copy and paste scenery, droning and repetitive ""music"", and brown - grey color scheme. Maybe it's supposed to convey a certain atmosphere, but for me it's boring and headache-inducing\n\nMaybe it gets good later, but the beginning hour is so bad I can't bring myself to continue. I can't imagine you can make a worse choice by spending your money on any other game",Not Recommended

"I've purchased this game for play station 2, xbox 360, and PC. It's a very good game. So good I've beaten it at least 20+ times. It feels a bit clunky walking around and shooting, but you have to remember this game is quite old now so it was good for its time. Would recommend playing this with a controller.  \n\nIt is tough right out of the gate though. Many times you will need to learn how to conserve ammo, or perhaps kite enemies. If you want a easy relaxing game this game might be a tough call for you. But if you don't mind a bit of a challenge 100% recommend.

"Shinji Mikami's final Resident Evil title is a winner and has stood the test of time. Definitely recommended.\n\nAfter several attempts at developing this game that were either transformed into a new IP or aborted, Shinji Mikami finally returned to direct another Resident Evil game. Unsurprisingly, said game ended up turning out to be the second best in the series. Mikami recognized that the formula was becoming stale and the horror was no longer working, so he decided to switch things up and make a fully 3D 3rd person action game with an over the shoulder camera.\n\nRE2’s Leon is the star of this game, and he is now working for the American Special Forces. He’s been tasked with saving the president’s daughter, who has been kidnapped and taken to a remote village in Spain. When he arrives in this village, it turns out all the villagers have been infected with a parasite they call Las Plagas.\n\nThe whole affairs is a fun commentary on the ruling class - we have the masses living in squalor, literally mind controlled by a religious leader (through Las Plagas). An aristocrat living in an enormously extravagant castle who thinks he's on top but is really just another pawn. Despite taking place in Spain, it seems like the whole thing is a jab against America to me, with a douchey American action hero who has no interest in saving anyone but the president's daughter (despite the massive number of people affected, who he blows straight to hell without a second thought instead of making the slightest attempt to help them).\n\nWhile the switch of genre to a 3rd person shooter isn't really to my taste, this game is simply so well made and so much fun that I can't argue with it. While it never gets anywhere near as anxiety inducing as 0 or 1, it does manage to evoke a terrific sort of frantic tension. It's much easier to marathon that the earlier games, as it never gets too frustrating or anxiety inducing.  It’s all a bit more linear than its predecessors, but structured similarly, with locked doors and key hunts. Item boxes are still gone here - you can drop items, but your inventory is much bigger now, so you’ll almost never need to. They also introduced a merchant to the game, so you can buy a larger inventory case and upgrade your weapons. The first 4 chapters (the village and castle) are particularly well put together and have a ton of atmosphere.\n\nUnfortunately, the game becomes very unfocused in its fifth and final chapter, which constantly changes setting and style in a highly jarring manner. It begins on an island, which already feels like it belongs in a Tomb Raider game instead of Resident Evil, but then we’re quickly taken through a secret lab (of course), a few tomb ruins, a waste disposal plant, a hilarious Call of Duty style war zone setpiece (complete with barbed wire and a helicopter assault), and an oil rig. It's really hard to know what to make of that last chapter when it jarringly changes tone from horror to action or past to present styles so frequently. This leads to really strange things like guys dressed as mercenaries carrying flails and crossbows, or destructible wooden barrels sitting in the middle of an urban waste dump. A brief moment of a creepy prison (literally just for one hallway) followed by a jetski escaping a wave then riding into the sunset.\n\nThe monster design in this game is truly excellent - it reaches the logical endpoint of the body horror aesthetic introduced in RE2. It’s quite satisfying to blow off someone’s head and see some sort of bizarre mixture of insects and innards pop out of the neck. The boss designs are also very cool along this front - there are two in particular which involve some awesome bodily transformation. The music is a mixed bag- some of it is very nice, and some of it is annoying. \n\nThis is the longest game in the series thus far - my cleared save file was 15hrs. I also died far less, as, once again, hard mode is not available from the start. This game is the opposite of RE0 in terms of difficulty - it’s hard to die multiple times in a row, as the game actually adjusts the difficulty and makes sections you die in easier each time. Not my favorite feature, but I understand that’s not the case in hard mode.\n\nAs in RE2, there are segments where you play as the main supporting character. In this case, that’s the president’s daughter, Ashley. As with Sherry from RE2, she is largely defenseless, and all she can do is throw lamps at people, so these sections involve a bit of stealth - a welcome addition.\n\nAda Wong (the main supporting character from Leon’s parts of RE2) returns in this game, and there are extra modes where you can play through segments of the game from her perspective, RE2 style. While I think this is better executed than RE2’s scenario split, it still involves a lot of repetition from the main game, and there’s only one new section (though it’s decently large). I wasn’t thrilled with these modes. There’s also a Mercenaries mode (kill as many zombies as you can on a timer), which is great fun if you’re into arcade modes.\n\nAs for the PC port, this is the Ultimate HD edition, which, from what I understand, is an entirely new port, separate from the oft-maligned original Sourcenext PC version. It has proper widescreen and mouse support, and is quite playable. The performance could be better, though - I should be able to run any game from 2005 at 1440p, but I experienced occasional slowdowns in certain sections even at 1080p. Compared to the much newer and shinier RE Revelations, which I was able to run at native resolution without a hitch, this leaves a bit to be desired on the performance front.",Recommended

You're either walking slowly and menacingly around, or running into every single glass wall and object you could run into.

You don't need to draw it with a Left bumper and swing with a right trigger. Anyway, i'm starting to get used to it. \n\n\n\nDissapointed.

Revisting the game has never felt so good and it comes packed with achievements to do and all the extras are good time consumers whenever you feel bored or just want to have fun and not do the story mode again.\n\nAs you already know this is a critcally aclaimed game and is probably known by many who played the game when it was released on the gamecube or other consoles and it sure does deliever with better graphics, technically improved, and top notch fps and nostalga that makes this game so rich.",Recommended

"People are confused about what genre this game really is. That's fair. Is it a horror game? Is it an action game? Is it both? Is it a shitty horror game?\n\nI don't think the game tells you you can target heads or legs to stun enemies, shoot weapons out of their hands, even shoot dynamite in their hands so it explodes, but you figure it out. I believe the game was designed like one of those water gun games you play at an arcade. Stranger things have come out of Japan without a hint of irony.\n\nDespite that you can't move while aiming, the game makes good use of it's space. You'll come across parts where you can aim at enemies above or below you. Sometimes you can shoot exploding barrels or lamps when the enemy is within proximity. It even has a part where you shoot parts of a spiked ceiling to stop it from impaling you.\n\nThe game, despite a couple boss fights and a more genuine survival horror part, sticks to its own rules. Any time a game breaks its rules, you get frustrated. The ""survival horror"" part is when you get separated so you play as Ashley, ducking and crawling under desks rather than shooting. You can throw lamps, but the game aims for you. It doesn't even give you that much. It throws out all its rules, and the player doesn't get much in return. But it's only a small section.\n\nThe game has a healthy variety of weapons, so you can approach it practically any way you like, none of which are definitively wrong. Melee is surprisingly viable because you can drop a guy to his knees and suplex him. I fucking love suplexing. Conversely, the game has a side game in which you get to play as various characters, a few of whom have different melee properties. One of them even has a devastating cooldown ability. Yes, you can play as Wesker. You can also knock a guy off his feet, aim down, and cut him up. If you want to save ammo. You also have 3 different types of grenades to work with, none of which are redundant. \n\nAnd we haven't even talked about the best part. Unlike Max Payne, this game never advertised that it has a dynamic difficulty system. I know that it can add/remove enemies depending on how well you do, but it may also factor in random instant kills or how often you have to deal with harder enemies. I believe you can run out of ammo completely, but if you're not acting like a maniac, the game makes you conserve ammo without starving you, especially in the beginning. The result is that the game rarely feels too hard or too easy. Combining this smooth balance with solid mechanics is what makes this game one of my favorites that when I finished it I was happy to immediately replay it. \n\nIt would be nice if at the end of chapters the game compared your score to your last score. Somewhere around the time Sonic the Hedgehog came out, console games got away, maybe intentionally, from being anything like arcades. How often do you see a high score screen in Dark Souls or Destiny? But at least the ends of chapters make note of your performance, like accuracy, enemies killed, and time spent. Better than nothing.\n\nAlso, you can upgrade your weapons. A cynical part of me says the only reason the game has a dynamic difficulty is because Capcom thought players might blow money on ill-advised purchases at the merchant, but I like to think not. You never know when, say, a new sniper rifle will show up, however, and if you're already upgraded the hell out of your current rifle, you might feel cheated. For the record, I've stuck with the first rifle you can buy through the whole game, and got by just fine. My advice is, when you come across a weapon that's aesthetically pleasing, feel free to stick to it. I can't stand the striker (a shotgun), so I never buy it. I haven't confirmed if it's more efficient to upgrade what you have, or spend money on a new weapon. I guess it all depends.\n\nThat said, other than an excellent action game, you're not getting a great story--unless you ironically enjoy bad voice acting and absurdity. If you're reading this review, you may have come across some of the memes this game spawned. I'm proud to say I enjoyed the silly lines before they were memes. Oh, and the side-character, Ashley, is voiced by the actress who does Sandy the squirrel from Spongebob. \n\nHave fun.",Recommended
"This game is old as dirt, but it's a classic none the less. However, there's no need for a gameplay review considering that it's been reviewed 1000000 times, but I'll give a rundown of the PC specific aspects. It supports pretty much all 16:9 resolutions which is cool, but the game cannot be run over 60fps even with .ini edits. Running the game over 60fps either results in a crash on load or the game going into slow motion. Furthermore, the textures looks like absolute garbage so I laugh everytime I read the Steam description, however a group of literal saints have been working on something called the RE4 HD project. So far they have replaced all of the environmental textures (ground, rocks, buildings, clutter, etc.) for the Village and Castle parts of the game, and are in the process of completing the Island. The textures look amazing so look out for that mod if you plan on buying the game. They also plan on retexturing everything else in the game such as weapons and enemies. Either way, if you do end up buying this game you'll have a lot of fun.",Recommended

Ashley is still as annoying as ever and the HD remasterd part actully made it look great. So now that i said that your probably like""Then why are giveing it a thumbs down?"" Well the reason is one simple word. LAG!!! The Computer i use for this is great. It played Fallout, Skyrim, Borderlands, and many other big games like its no problem. But not this game. Lemme walk you through this. Ok you just bought the game and it's done intalling so you open the game up. The beginning game cutscene playes and once its done you make your way to the house for your first fight. But then somthing strange happenes. You movment is extremely slow. The mosion blur efect makes it impossible to see while this is happening. Also, Movment and sound are not is sync anymore. Another thing is that the commands you put in ( like  walking forward or shooting or interacting with somthing) take longer to actully work. Now there are ways to fix this and thats what actully made me keep going. If you simply spam the esc key a few times the lag will go away. So you continue the game. I don't know about anyone else but for me this stoped working. Now the only way to fix lag is to go into the options, select minimize screen, then make the screen bigger again. After that theres no lag. But once you progress through the game this becomes a major issue. For some reason the lag always startes when i open the inventory. So now whenever you get into a fight and need to heal, you have to minimize and reopen the screen. This gets really annoying once you get to fighting harder enemys or when your trying to buy something ( Lag also occurs when you talk to the merchant) It basiclly makes the game boreing since there's no flow anymore. And yes i already tried lowering the settings but still it lags. IDK if anyone else will have this issue but keep this comment in mind if you plan to buy the game. Well good luck and try not to kill Ashley.",Not Recommended

"I've played Resident Evil 4 on almost every console if not every console and I gotta say, the PC version only made it better. The ability to do simple things like change the color of the laser sight really made this game 10 times more enjoyable. It's no surprise that RE4 is loved by many so I'll keep it short.

This game is most likely my favorite game ever created and for very simple reasons.\n\n-Content Rich\n-Atmosphere\n\nI will be playing this game until im dead fuck you,Recommended
"Resident Evil 4: Oh man, where do I begin with this?\n\nIf you have ever owned pretty much ANY console in existance past the Gamecube, you may have played RE4! It is an instant classic of a game, and while some fans do hate on it for ""ruining"" the series, I disagree.\n\nNot only does the game reward you for your hard time and effort, it is extremely replayable! I am not exactly sure why this is, as the map is really linear at some points, but it is a challenge! If you like challenges, this is your game!\n\nImagine if Dark Souls and RE had a child, this would be it. It is difficult, I won't lie, especially in the games hardest difficulty (Professional), but it will reward you for completing the game with weapons, and cool costumes, and you get to keep your stuff after you complete the game for another playthrough. Plus you have another two mini-campaigns and a Mercenaries mode, which you can play as various characters from the Resident Evil franchise (5 stars with all characters on all stages for a sweet surprise!). \n\nThe cons of the game would have to be the rage-inducing moments it produces, even though that in itself isn't much of a con for me, but maybe it would be for you. Also, the graphics are a bit dated, although this is an HD version of the game, so the graphics aren't exactly too bad... Lastly, the game can get repetitive at times, which may discourage some of you who are expecting a everchanging adventure, but if you can get past the repetitiveness of the game, you will have a great time!\n\nOverall, I highly recommend it for RE fans, and those who are seeking a not-so-scary, but not-so-easygoing game. Thank you for taking the time to read my review, and I hope this will help you to decide on your purchase of this extraordinary game!",Recommended

Not very scary game but extremely entertaining nevertheless.\nGood game lenght and graphics are still acceptable though a bit outdated.,Recommended
"The game is simply endless levels of bad guys coming at you that require shooting to death, or in some cases karate kicking or blowing up. The story is clichéd drivel, involving the Illuminati (Los Illuminados) and some zombie type infection-plague, with occasional references to Umbrella. I know this is considered a great classic. The controls and over-shoulder camera view are not very satisfying. Effectively the game is just about grinding and blasting your way from one environment to the next, in the search of an important young woman who has been kidnapped by some shady people. There are some puzzles along the way, but the boss fights are more challenging … That’s a lot of shooting. I may be in the minority here, but I actually remember enjoying RE5 more than this one. \nI have never seen the original version or the previous PC version/s, so cannot compare. Yes I experienced a few annoyances, not just related to the controls. However, I never had any issues that impacted on my game experience other than a serious slow-down in FPS that happened sporadically. If we had better viewing angles and camera controls, this would have made a big difference.",Recommended

"I used to love this game. Played all the way through it on GameCube. Just to give you a reference from the poi I'm coming from.\n\nSo let's start with the graphics. Maybe It's just been to long but to me the game still looks like a gamecube game. \nDespite putting this in 4k and jacking everything up to ultra the Textures give me a headache.\nUgly...as sin. The ground to the walls etc just are SO BAD it makes me cry. \nI'm not a graphics whore. \nTo give you a reference I also own The original Resident Evil remastered. I think the graphical overhaul to that game looked phenomenal. I know it's a different scheme but regardless the game is impressive.\nThis one is not.The characters may be in HD but that probably is for the worst.\nJust seems like they put very little effort into the overhaul imo. (If you get it just look at the outside of the car when your being escorted to the village, THEY UGLIEST LOOKING TEXTURED CAR IN THE HISTORY OF HISTORIES>>>NO JOKE)\n\nThe control scheme is still jank as shit but if you have pleyed RE this won't suprise you. \nPeople seem to act as if it's a good control scheme. ITS NOT. It was an improvement for RE series. Not even remotely decent for any game outside of it. Gears of War scheme is not even related to how bad these controls are, so when you read the relation just know these people are blind and perhaps work for Capcom or they have had some brain damage.\n\nAs far as the story it is complete cheese. That is obviously good or bad depending on what you like. (THEY TOOK THE PRESIDENT""S DAUGHTER!!!! OH NOES!!!)\n\nNo FOV which means youll be up close and personal to the back of Leons head and right in front of a ton of UGLY TEXTURED WALLS.\n\nIf you played this game and like it then it is what it was then. I wouldn't reccomend getting this over any of the other versions if you can get those cheaper. \nNothing in this feels justified paying more if that is the case.\n\nWhen I played this long ago I only played consoles.\nOnly thing I can think at this point is being so used to playing PC the last few years and not playing any consoles has made me a bit(??) jaded.\n\nBad graphical overhaul and ARCHAIC controls mixed with CHEESE makes me wonder how I actually ever thought this was a great game.\n\nAh well...times change I guess.",Not Recommended

The storyline is pretty simple yet good as they say simple but effective is key.

resident evil 4 in pc is so ****ing bad and crash alot of tims the it is hard to aim or even walk,Not Recommended
"I am playing RE4 for my first time now after hearing alot of praise for it, here's my thoughts so far.\n\nIt has clunky/outdated controls, horrible voice acting and a cliched, terribly written story... yet it is still awesome somewhow. This game was made at a transitional point for games. A time when AAA games were not hand holding, casual and overly ""cinematic"" experiences. (Not to say there is anything wrong with cinematic games when done right.)\n\nThe main focus of the game is the gameplay. It's rough around the edges, yet polished at the same time, committing to it's horrible controls and C grade story. These faults become it's main charm and you will learn to love them. It can be very challenging at times, but rewarding. It has great level pacing and you are always fighting a new boss, or going to a new and interesting place.\n\nThat being said, if you are a modern, more casual gamer you might not be able to adapt to the archaic controls. When I say they are bad, I mean it. You cannot move while aiming, and you cannot reload unless you are aiming. Aiming/free looking  while moving is also a weridly disjointed experience. They feel  seperate. Fans call them ""tank"" controls, and for a good reason. I personally like the controls as they make for many close calls in combat, and make you feel very vulnerable even to small crowds of enemies. \n\nI miss games like this, even though I haven't played this one in particular untill now. It makes you realize how games have declined over the years in some regards, particularly single player ones. They just don't make em like this anymore.\n\nIt's definitely dated, but I am liking it so far!\n\n7.5/10",Recommended

"This game is one of my all-time favorite video games hands down. I grew up playing Resident Evil on the Playstation and Resident Evil 2 had always been my favorite. I purchased a GameCube just for Resident Evil 4 and I was not disappointed. The gameplay and pacing is perfect and the new feature of over the shoulder was great change for the game series in my opinion. The graphics for its time were amazing and I fell they still hold up well to this day. The plot doesn’t have much to do with the other Resident Evil games but to be fair there has not been a good story in resident Evil since 3. The campaign is pretty lengthy compared to most games. Also I notice a lot of people complain that this game diverged from the survival horror. I will disagree with that particular group and say that this was the last Recommended scary Re game yes including seven which I thought was not scary or fun. While not as scary as its predecessors, there are many intense moments where I still sink in my chair. Most notably the chainsaw characters, Regenerador and the Verdugo. The game has plenty of replay value I have completed the campaign at least six times. The best thing for the replay value is Mercenaries where you can play as Leon, Ada, Krauser, Hunk and Wesker. Each character with unique abilities to dispose of your foes. There is lot to say about this game, however I just wanted to say my quick thoughts of one of my favorite games of all time.  10/10",Recommended
"One of the best and most influential games of all time, I doubt there are many people that haven't played this game at some point or another but if you haven't this version is a pretty good way to experiance it.  Be warned that it seems to require a decent amount of power to run with the setting turned up in HD with a good framerate, probably due to not being very well optimized.  If you turn down some of the settings it doesn't have a very noticeable effect on the visuals and you can get a locked 30 fps pretty easiliy, which is fine.",Recommended

"I would've gotten a refund for this game, but when I first bought it I didn't have a controller and the keyboard controls felt odd. I naively assumed it would play better once I got a controller. When I finally did, it was crap. There was no left analog stick support, unless you count using the left stick as a d-pad. And it was too late for a refund.\n\nApparently, the pc port originally was d-pad only because that was all that was available for pc at the time. BUT this is an hd-remake. There's no excuse for no adding analog controls while they were at it, the lazy jerkwads. And what controls I did have were unintuitive as hell. Defenders might say something like ""you just have to get used to it."" But I retort that I should've have to! ANY console version has better controls than this. The graphics aren't worth putting up with it.\n\nTL:DR - The controls suck! Like with Tales of Symphonia, this ""HD"" port left me wishing I was playing the original version instead. On the GAMECUBE!

if your looking for the best game on steam this would be it and let me tell you why if you like a good story with a good sense of humor then this would be the game for you not only that but it gives you a variety of things to do no not quest just optional things such as looking for treasure or hidden herbs that you might need in the future and i could list more now when i first started (re4) i thought to my self man this game looks awful and colorless but as i progess more to the game its not as bad as i thought it was gonna be you got your protaganist saying cheesy one liners and theres more then one boss fight just in case you ever got bored (idk where im going with this) but anyways when you finish the game and im not gonna spoil it to anyone you get more content just in case you thought that was it so if i were you and i had 20 bucks i would definitly buy this game without a doubt mabey even play the story twice just in case you miss something hidden in the game,Recommended

"The most dificult balance in horror games is how to give the player agency, yet make them feel terrified to move. To give power while making you feel powerless. This game accomplishes that.\n1. Maintains a dirty ambiance, making you feel grose.\n2. During combat the music and audio shifts, driving the player to want to find every enemy as quickly as possible just to make it stop.\n3. An intuitive inventory that limits what you can carry based on the relative size of every item you carry, forcing you to decide between carrying more ammo & grenades or more healing herbs.\n4. Making ammo and healing scarce so that the player can never go in guns blazing and must aim their shots.\n5. Using a combat system that is good enough to get the job done, but clunky enough to add the the fear of the situation. You do not run and gun, you run or gun.\n\n6. Generating stretch goals that reward you for playing the game multiple times on higher difficulties because you slogged through the game counting each bullet, now its time to use a rocket launcher with infinite ammo to show those zombies what for!\n\nI played this when it first came out on the GameCube and it is still terrifying today.

Though an upgrade to its predecessors' tank controls (yeah, I do know some things about the series despite this being my first and only game so far) at the time, it's a bit tank controlly compared with the modern age.\n\nAnd that's great. \n\nSeeing how so many 3rd person games these days control the exact same and play very similarly, it's refreshing to play a game with a different control scheme... one that makes for very tense gameplay. Controls are simple as well - on a controller anyway. People moaning about controls in the reviews don't know what they're talking about. Either they're playing with keyboard (why the fuck would you play a console port that way) or they just can't handle a game that doesn't control like every other game you can buy today. You move either forwards or backwards with the analog stick, you stop to shoot and aim over your shoulder, you can do an easy 180 by flicking the analog stick back while pressing A, you can see left or right with the right analog (which is more to check your blindspots rather than check out the environment)... Its controls make the gameplay what it is, which I find fascinating. \n\nThese controls make you move about the Spanish farms, castles and military bases in a tactical manner. It's all about positioning your character, learning to shoot the best parts of the zombies, learning when to shoot and stagger enemies in order to perform a roundhouse kick that serves as crowd control, learning inventory management and when to use certain weaponry. Great stuff all around.\n\nThe campaign sends you to a variety of locations and puts you in a variety of situations. The pacing is great. Never does a section outstay its welcome. Bosses are pretty challenging and some are pretty tenseful and scary. \n\nStory's pretty fun, it's basically a B-movie plot on crack. You'll see some weird, goofy shit in this, but the game seems to be self-aware. Or it's just very Japanese. You'll know what I mean if you've played more Japanese games. Leon is a fun main character, whose awkward one-liners make him endearing. Don't know whether they're awkward because of messy translation or because they're intentionally strange, either way I wouldn't have it any other way. \n\nMost of the time it doesn't really feel like a horror game, but some of the bosses surprise you in that regard. See it as... Survival Thriller with an occasional moment of Survival Horror. \n\nCan't recommend this enough. Newcomers like me, I suggest you pick it up to see what the fuss is all about. The game has aged very well, looks pretty good, plays well, and since this one doesn't seem to be very bogged down in lore it's a good entry game. Definitely going to go back to the old games as well as the newer ones, this one may have made me a fan of the series. Or just a fan of this particular entry.",Recommended
"This is not only my favorite game in the Resident Evil series, but one of my all time favorite games in the horror / survival genre. It's a classic in so many ways and just as much fun today as it was when it came out. I've played the Wii version, and the XBOX360 HD remake, and enjoyed both immensely.\n\nHowever, the control scheme on the PC just makes this an exercise in extreme frustration. You move forward and back with W and S, turn with A and D. Control where you look with the mouse. Should be easy, and I get these are called ""tank"" controls, but for the love of god the fact that the direction you are aiming with the mouse has nothing to do with where you are walking is just too much for me. And there's no sidestep / strafe either. \n\nThis is a hard game to begin with, and that's part of the fun, but not this way. It's torture.",Not Recommended

Its a good port for what it is. Moving from controller to mouse and keyboard makes it a much more enjoyable experience. \n\nGraphically, its what you would expect from a 12 year old game. It got SOME graphic adjustments, but it still has the late ps2 era graphics. Its not an ugly game by any means, just not pretty either.\n\nDo I reccomend it? Yes.",Recommended

"What makes Resident Evil 4 so good? This could mean so many different things to anyone. To me, it’s limiting player movement and, just, gingerly tossing insurmountable odds against the player like it ain’t no thing. Not that this is a hard game or that it isn’t fair. Ammunition is handed out like candy and enemy types follow similar patterns. Nay, it’s the combination of enemy types and your choices as a player that helps every situation seem overwhelming. “But, in reality, in the heat of the moment, you can really get passed everything based on how you move on the battlefield.” – Solid Snake\n\nAfter years of playing across multiple platforms I began to appreciate RE4 as tactical action espionage. I really enjoyed the stop-n-pop shooting mechanics. I wasn’t even aware of it, but stopping to shoot forced me to be tactical when doin’ whatever. It made you think about where you wanted to end up as you started each engagement. And what you have to get through. And how you gonna do it. But without any cover based, squad command whatever the fuck BS. Rather, the content here is handled with a more arcade finesse. You must rely on your wits, and once you gain a handle of them, you are completely capable of anything this game will hit you with. Ammo, cash, fame – the game takes care of the rest. \n\nEven your inventory screen is a little mini-game in itself. It makes you move all your junk around to optimize storage capacity, like, fuck..? I always liked this too. It indeed is like a nice, little therapeutic ""break"" to help normalize the games other stresses. I would even take the time to group everything by category just to extend this break time. Some would call it OCD, but I disagree. “I call it healing. The battlefield can be hard on one’s body, mind…and soul, Snake.” – Dr. “Para-Medic” Clark\n\nI recommend this game to anyone, you high? It’s a fun game with a light challenge that’s not too scary. And it’s pretty cheap. You know, Recommended story, I bought this game for 20 bucks at GameStop when it was newly ported onto PS2. Recommended story. Brand new. I couldn’t believe it either. I asked the kid-clerk, who was older than me at the time, how much it “truly” cost. “20 bucks,” He said. I ripped off Capcom, at the time, and it was worth it. I went back to that store a week later and it was back up to 50 big ones. The Big Guy was smiling down on me that day, I'll tell ya. Today, I come to you as a messenger and urge you towards also ripping off Capcom. \n\nSo to speak.",Recommended

"Resident Evil 4, the game that is on almost every modern gaming platform.\n\nResident Evil 4 is the goofy B movie action game what sparked the Devil May Cry franchise with it's earliest test incarnation and diverged Resident Evil from survival horror to 3rd person over the shoulder action.\n\nThe story has you playing one of the Resident Evil 2 protagonists, Leon S. Kennedy, who is sent to non-specific rural Spain to find Ashley Graham, the US President's daughter. The locals aren't fond of their new foreign visitor and after having multiple hatchets and Spanish slander thrown at him, being shanked, chased with a chainsaw, and losing his fabulous jacket, Leon has the suspicion that something is astray.\n\nThe B movie wackiness only continues as you:\n- Fight a giant fish\n- Kneecapping priests to perform a German Suplex.\n- Run from a Napoleon statue.\n- Fight a PredAlien.\n- Knife fight with Rambo.\n- Trade with a trench coat merchant who owns enough weapons to level a city.\n- A cult leader with a phallic tentacle.\n- Getting talked down on by the luscious Ada Wong.\n- Make cheesy oneliners with Spanish Napoleon about stage plays.\n\nThis game is essentially aware with how silly it is however it works surprisingly well. \n\nThe gameplay is simple enough, it diverged from set camera angles to a 3D environment, having you control Leon in a 3rd person manner. Aiming down your weapon brings up a laser sight which is the point where your bullets will hit, this can be use to hit enemy arms, legs, and head to stun them as well as shoot projectile such as hatchets.\n\n Resident Evil 4 also features a a unique grid based inventory system shown as a case. Items are sized by a set number of squares which allows you to be inventive with your item placements in your inventory.\n\nThis game is definitely worth the purchase, despite being a decade old, it's aged quite well in terms of look and gameplay.\nUnlike Resident Evil 5 which i found more enjoyable with a friend and lacking many interesting levels and enemy types and the mess that is Resident Evil 6 which takes itself far too seriously to be a macho western title and to boring to even play through. Resident Evil 4 maintains it's level of fun and with Leon who makes light comedy of his life threatening situation as well as making the antagonist look like a bunch of cartoon villains with his cheesy oneliners.\n\nMy last thoughts are ""LEON HELP, HEEEELP, HELP ME LEON""",Recommended

I know the storyline, loot system, and variance in enemies/environment is great, especially for a thirteen year old game, but I couldn't get past sixteen minutes of gameplay before shutting it off (which resulted in having to hard boot my computer).\n\nIf they ever do a remake of this game I'd definitely check it out and see if they've fixed a lot of the game breaking issues, but I can't justify spending twenty dollars on this game.",Not Recommended

"I've been playing this game since 2005.\n\nGamecube - ✔\nPS2 - ✔\nWii - ✔\nXbox 360 - ✔\nPlaystation 4 - ✔\n\nIt's pretty much the perfect action game. Well known for it's brilliant pacing, extremely refined shooting mechanics, and the OCD nightmare that is the inventory system, it changed the RE series by changing the view point to an over the shoulder perspective, rather than static. This is now the standard for pretty much any third person game. Gears of War, Mass Effect, GTA V, The Last Of Us, Uncharted... I could go on. But I won't.\n\n[h1]Graphics[/h1]\n\nSolid 1080p, 60/30 FPS modes, AF filters and various texture settings. It still looks pretty clean for a game from 2005.\n\n[h1]Sound[/h1]\n\nThe original SFX/Music on the Gamecube actually sounded good. However, on nearly every subsequent port they were compressed beyond belief. You'll be pleased to hear these are fully uncompressed.

The quieter moments at the start are very quickly offset by dudes with chainsaws and Las Plagas head spiders/crabs, not to mention the frequent areas of respawning enemies.\n\nOverall it's still a fantastic game, well worth the purchase price. There is however, a new glitch introduced in this version. Some sort of desync or FPS related problem with the rifle reloads. Turns out they were never coded for 60 FPS, and as a result still plays at 30 FPS, which looks dreadful. But I'm a complete fanboy, and I don't use the rifles anyway.\n\n                                                        乁། ˵ ◕ – ◕ ˵ །ㄏ",Recommended

"I would say Resident Evil 4 is the best Franchise I've ever played. I played RE 4 when it first came out on PS 2 several years ago and coming back to play it again was like the best thing ever. RE 4 the game itself is great I would rate it 95 in meta score imo. It really brings back great memories from my childhood because I grew up somewhat playing old games. Anyways, if you're new to RE 4 take your time exploring the each individual map and make sure you get all the secret items. I don't want to spill everything but all you have to do is have fun. There are several modes as well after beating the game once. You can either choose from Easy or Normal when you start a new game for the very first time. The extra modes are really fun after finally beating the game. You will be able to unlock new stuff when you beat the main game and the sub games you can also receive specialized guns. It will be a surprise which guns you can unlock or you can also search up guides on the internet. Sorry for the long review this is my very first review of a game on steam. I definitely recommend this game for everyone to try. Anyways Have a good one and Safe gaming :). Make sure to take breaks when you play this game.

You would be better off playing this port with a controller instead. \n\nIf you really do want to play this version of RE4 with a keyboard and mouse, you would be better off playing the original PC version, where the controls feel smoother and you would be able to respond to the environment faster.

"This is an actual review for people who have not played the game yet and are seriously considering dropping 20$ on a more than a decade old title. having never played this game before, or any resident evil for that matter, i'm helped by the total lack of nostalgia goggles and can, i hope, be unbiased. \n\nfirst things first, the game controls like complete ass, complete fucking ass. leon moves like a shitty golf cart in that you have forward, reverse, and steering. you could honestly model a lawn mower under his ass and the gameplay would be largely unchanged. also he moves with about as much urgency as an elderly pedestrian in a crosswalk. this combined with camera controls that do not so much pan as they snap jerkily from vista to vista means that you will be more threatened by the controller in your hands than anything on screen. This is somewhat mitigated by the fact that the average enemy is about as fast and agile as a medium sized shit and has the self preservation instincts of a jellyfish. It all adds up to something much more akin to rail shooter than an fps or horror/survival game. You find a nice little bottleneck and dispassionately pop skulls, standing stock still because the mysteries of the run and gun are as esoteric to our hero as the sidestep.\n\nThe boss fights are another thorny annoyance in that almost every single one is about as much fun as cardiac arrest. The developers seem to have noticed however because the rpg wrecks their fucking shit. I’m serious, every boss that doesn't contrive a thousand bullshit reasons to keep coming back over and over is just a single well placed rpg away from becoming so much purulent chowder. That's not totally Recommended, after hitting the final boss with the regular ass pedestrian rpg i brought with me, some lady in a victoria's secret bra and a dress that showed more ass than a donkey convention tossed me a special red rpg i had to use to initiate the final cutscene. Needless to say if the game has an entire special weapon dedicated almost exclusively to skipping the really tough fights, then why even bother putting boss fights in the game to begin with?\n\nAnd now comes the final nail in the coffin for me at least, the story. I know i said previously that i had never played a resident evil game before so my opinion towards the franchise remained unsullied, but unfortunately i have played a capcom game before and i know exactly what that entails. I’ll be honest, i skipped every cutscene after the little man in the napolean costume started trying to menace me, but I had already been exposed to enough stilted writing, comically broad spanish accents, and out of the blue ex machinas that i honestly don't think i missed out on much. Oh and there's enough gratuitous underage upskirts to land half of japan in rikers. It's worth it though, because if you push through the mercifully short campaign you can unlock a special costume for our teenage sidekick that hides her panties but gets her tits out.\n \nThat's not to say RE4 is completely without merit. The gun crafting is fairly enjoyable and rewarding, and the inventory system is second to none. Exploration is fun, even if the mountains of ammo you will inevitably drag around with you drain away any remaining vestiges of challenge the game had left. On the whole RE4 is not bad, i played through the entire campaign so i must not hate it as much as the preceding paragraphs would suggest, but it is far, far from good. The very few gems are buried under so many shitty quick time events, haphazard controls, and unapologetic misogyny that i cannot recommend the game to anyone who doesn't already love it.",Not Recommended

There are some really goofy moments, but somehow they don't ever really break the game. Somehow, even with the crazy sh*t You'll see, I was never really pulled out of the game. BE AWARE: I absolutely HATED the game when I started because of the control scheme - I felt as though it was too rigid and difficult to be aware of your surroundings. It wasn't fun...that is until a few minutes in. Over the course of the game you get to appreciate the actual merit of the choice of the sorta ""Tank"" control Scheme. You can never see behind yourself, forcing you to run blindly from your attacker for respite. You must stop every once in a while -Completely- to observe your surroundings for any possible items or detail. Yes, the enemies can get repetitive at points, but you'll find that there are actually a wide variety of enemies throughout the entire game. The enemy types are strategically plopped in when they are necessary - it all felt appropriate. I didn't feel any horror at all, really, but you will get the ocassional jump scare, or being horribly butchered by chainsaw moments.

"A Recommended masterpiece and my personal favorite out of all of the Resident Evil games.\n\nWhile RE6 and other zombie shooters turn to run-and-gun tactics with hordes of throw away enemies, RE4's enemies feel like they have purpose in their placement and can be challenging even in small groups. Item management is key and rushing headlong into everything will get you killed more often than not; potential doom hides around every corner and dangerous foes lurk in the shadows just waiting for you to trip up. Plan ahead and take it slow.\n\nThe atmosphere is great combination of action, suspense, and campiness. One minute you're running for your life from crazed villagers and the next you're sassing some short lunatic with a removeable right hand and then battling a giant statue of said crazy man.\n\nIt's also the only game I can think of that made an escort quest fun.",Recommended
"So I just got through my first run of the game, I got interested in the franchise of Resident Evil a while back cause the YouTube channel Game Grumps played the REmaster so I watched it and decided to get this game as it was on sale, I just got around spending the past 2 days dedicating all my time to it and I've got to say although I dont feel as if this game is a masterpiece, the gameplay is extremely solid and fun, I've heard in the Resident Evil community that this either comes along to most as the best RE game or the worst because it took a turn for the franchise, I can't say since I dont have too much experience with any of them except watching the REmaster of the first and beating the fourth myself.

I can play 15-20 minutes of the game and then it just crashes. this would simply be a slight annoyance to me if it weren't for the way saving works in this game. Pretty much what happens is I play for a short amount of time before it crashes and i have to completely restart at my last save point.\n\nAll in all, this is my favorite game, but I spent 20 dollars to play 20 minutes at a time and start over.

"One word of advice for people who think about buying this game: its great, BUT you need to consider some things beforehand. QTEs are a real trend in this game, and i get them theyre there to put pressure on the player. However, on the PC its quite... hard, like you need to mash to get the 'quickly push x' prompt to work, almost hard enough to feel like youre breaking the 'x' key. Other than that, the game is great except for one other blemish that would make it beneficial to buy this game on another console: it runs like ass, honestly it runs fine on my computer but only becuase its really beefy in terms of the technology but even my friend who has only 4 GB less RAM than me with basically the same exact computer can only run this game 15% of the time at 60 fps. RE4 is really, really great and i suggest it to pretty much anyone who enjoys an exciting and interesting experience, but consider your computer before getting the PC version, it will be a lot better for you.",Recommended

I know resident evil controls are different than normal fps titles, but this game is rediculously uncomfortable to play with a mouse. I've no doubts someone has come up with a way to get around whatever this port has done, but I don't want to go hunting for a fix when it should just work out of the box.\n\nAlso, could not start task manager without the game disabling my graphics card? It happened twice. My screens were still on, sounds still playing, keyboard still responding, but had to reboot to be able to see anything.\n\nWas very excited to play again, but this port makes me wish i had tried to play it sooner instead of let it sit in my library because now I can't refund it.",Not Recommended

"To those who have never played this game:\n\nshort version: It good. Very.\n\nlong version:\n\nI have never played any of the Resident Evil series before, but I remembered hearing that this one game was the epitome of survival horror for its time, so I finally decided to get it (over a decade later, ikr). (It was also a favorite on G4's X-Play! Anyone else remember them? Anyone? Ok...) I read that some people were not satisfied with the control scheme, but here's my opinion: IGNORE THEM. This is an awesome game! The inventory management, treasure-hunting, upgrade system (gotta love the Merchant), and combat makes this game extremely addicting. Also, there is plenty of FREE in-game DLC you can unlock, just the way it should be!\n\nSome cons: when I started, the default motion blur made me sick, so I recommend turning it off. I made some other change but cannot remember it now. (Just tweak the settings until you like what you see.) And some people do not like that you cannot move while aiming to shoot, and they do not like the tank-like controls. However, I got accustomed to it using my 360 gamepad, and you can too. If you just can't let go of your CoD or Halo control schemes and will cry if you have to, then maybe this isn't for you. But get over it. It's really worth it. Also, quick-time events are occasional gameplay, but it gets predictable and easy to work with. Oh, and one boss fight seemed too unfair, but whatever.\n\nIf you've never played this, buy it. I'm glad I did. It's an experience you will not forget. Be warned though. You will become addicted...\n\n\nMerchant: ""WHAT ARE YA BUYIN'?""",Recommended

Leon is sent to rescue President's daughter...seems easy enough well shit It ain't man...\n[*] Great voice acting, especially Leon and the villains throughout the game.\n[*] Merchant is probably the most cool character ever known to gaming community.\n[*] Feels like an actual Survival-Horror game. You have to conserve shitloads of ammo, herbs and grenades for mini-bosses and actual bosses. At some point you might find bunch of TMP ammo and then suddenly you find loads of Rifle ammo. So you'll have to choose wisely what weapons you have to use.\n[*] Difficult and enjoyable puzzles. Now I am that type of guy who hates puzzles in games. I admit that I didn't have that fun solving them. But eventually when you would finish a puzzle you realize how simple it actually was. Especially that puzzle when you play as Ashley and you have to move those stone plates. IT TOOK ME SLIGHTLY OVER 1 HOUR TO FINISH IT.\n[*] Boss fights are tough and I love it. Once you realize the weak spot of a boss, it's quite simple to kill it. Still requires a bunch of strategy to take bosses down. Killing a boss hasn't been ever this satisfying as in this game. It feels like an actual achievement.\n[/list]\nI wish nowadays games were like this, as in terms of opening extra content. No stupid paywalls etc... Complete the game on normal to get mini-stories on other characters, epic unique weapons, a mercenary mode, costumes and proffessional mode.\n[b]This is probably the most important things about it, without making it too long.

"I haven't yet played any other Resident Evil games, and this is the only one I currently own.\n\nFirst thing to note is the interesting way the game controls. Even though RE4 uses a third person camera instead of the fixed camera perspective of the older games, the game still retains its tank controls, by which I mean instead of the A and D keys strafing your character, it instead rotates the character. However after you get used to it, it's a functional control scheme.\n\nAlso, unlike most modern third person shooters, you cannot move and shoot at the same time. When you right click to aim, you are now fixed in your position until you no longer hold down the button. However, this hasn't been a frustration to me so far, since the enemies move and act in a way that accomodates this sort of play. \n\nEven with these differences, this game is very fun so far. I haven't gotten too far, but I very much enjoy the time I've spent so far, and I highly recommend this game to people, even if they haven't played the other games. The story is pretty hard to follow for me, as I have little to no context for the story (I know what Racoon City is, but that's about it) but even then, it's still fun to watch and follow.",Recommended

"A little story time:\nWhen capcom released RE7, I was thrilled. When I saw the price, I was...less thrilled. Especially after I saw footage of the whole game. It wasn't worth the money to me, especially not when the entire game felt like an autistic lovechild of Outlast and F.E.A.R\n That's when i decided to re-buy all the old RE games or at least those available on steam. \n\nThis game was the very first game i ever played on the Wii, when the console came out. Let me tell you, lil 9 year old me was terrified of this game.\nThe graphics were THE SHIT back then, even if it looks outdate for todays standards.\n\nBut hear me out - the athmosphere created in this game is still phenomenal, even if the graphics are, yes, outdated. It's dark and dull, washed out colors, the sounds are authentic, gross and fit perfectly to the situations. The dialogues are cheesy af, but thats a common thing in resident evil games! The voiceacting is pretty great as well, compared to the shitty robotic voiceover in RE5 ( not to mention RE6, yuck! )\n\nI've seen people complaining about the controls and how stiff and unresponsive they are - but let me tell you, the Wii version was stiff and unresponsive too, even WITH motion controls, besides I am convinced that stiff controls are simply a part of the experience, just like Tomb Raider. I personally got used to the controls pretty fast, especially since most enemies move at a pace of 5 meters per hour anyway, and are not much of a problem to deal with once you get the hang of it. They are pretty satisfying to shoot down too, also there are variations in enemies and enemy behaviours, which I missed in RE7.\n\nI know some hardcore fans of the games say that RE4 is a bad game compared to the previous games, and it just might be my nostalgia speaking here, but i still love this game, even if it does have its flaws. I still play it though, and i'll always consider it the first game that got me interested in both third person and first person shooter games.\n",Recommended
"Editorial incoming!\n\nI don't even know where to start....\n\nSo this is the game that caused the shift.  But seriously, how major a shift was it? In my opinion, it wasn't much...but it was just enough. Apparently as history tells us, the fanbase had gotten tired of fixed camera angles and the bird eye view of the series. Resident Evil: Code Veronica wasn't enough. So Capcom came up with this....\n\nIt's been around 17 years since I last saw Leon, and I must say that it was great to see him. He has come a long way from his one rookie cop day. Now he is on a mission to save the President's daughter, Ashley.  Doesn't sound like a zombie game to me. In fact it turned out to be more terrifying than zombies. \n\nSome people may call this an action horror, but I say that this is still survivor horror. Maybe that is because I was trying to juggle killing willing villager test subjects and learning the new controls at the same time! The controls....I hated them, but I learned them. I hated the fact that the keyboard controls pretty much everything from Leon's movement to the movement of the camera. At times, the over the shoulder view really threw me off, especially since enemies can surround you, and its hard to get a good aim. However, over time, the controls became more familiar. Good my ranting for the controls are over. The game nails the feeling of hopelessness and claustrophobia. Yes Leon is no longer a rookie and he has guns and he can knife stuff and kick stuff, but ammo is scarce and he is one against an army - and what an army it is. Villagers bent to kill you, flying insects that feel that they were taken from the world of H.P. Lovecraft (the migo, look them they are terrifying), regenerators (just run! just run!), spiky regenerators (AAAHHH! Run faster!!) Plus there are traps EVERYWHERE. You hardly get to breathe, except when the illusive shopkeeper who looks like a black market vendor shows up. I have never been so happy to see a vendor in my life. He sells weapons, upgrades, and items, for a price of course. Now when I got used to the controls and the camera view, I really appreciated the use of the camera, or should I say the tightness of it. In classic Resi, the camera was fixed, making looking aroudn the corner not possible, unless you turned the corner. In RE4, the camera is close, making you feel claustrophobic. Sometimes the camera does go for a bit of bird eye view, depending on your location, but the tight feeling never left.\n\nNow the story, villains, and dialogue are all classic RE. It is scary, but cheesy. It's over the top, and I loved that. The herbs, typewriters (sans ink ribbon thank goodness), and files are all there for the collecting. Also, the puzzles are still there! They may be a lot simpler (who really wants to go through water treatment puzzle difficulty?!), but they are still present. You cannot continue until keys are found and puzzles are solved. But there is something new! There are treasures to collect for extra money. Trust me you'll be glad to went to the trouble to get those treasures so that you can afford those very necessary gun upgrades and special weapons.\n\nI just want to give a special mention to the reappearance of Ada Wong. With all new villains, and an ongoing escort mission of Ashley, it was a welcome sight to see the double playing agent. As I was struggling to get a grasp of the game, the sight of Ada let me know that it was still RE and Leon and Ada were back at it. Speaking of Ashley, just how annoying is she. Very annoying but in an endearing kind of way. She can't defend herself at all, making that already tense situation even worse since you have to protect her. The times when they are separated was a welcome change...unless I was controlling Ashley. Thats right you get to play as Ashley at times, and that is just scary, since she gets no weapons and she has to outmaneuver enemies. Have fun! \n\nNow the negatives...and there aren't that many. In fact its just one! I love that after beating the final boss, there is a self destruct sequence! YAY! However, its not enough to beat the enemy in time. Oh no, that would be too familiar. You have to escape via jetski the island that is about to explode. Yeah..who likes to beat the final boss only to die via minigame?! This to me was ridiculous. You have to maneuver a very fast jet ski while debri is falling all around you. One piece hits you and its over. Luckily, you can start over right at the minigame, but still to have the final test be a minigame and not a big bad boss really rubbed me wrong. \n\nNow would I call this the best game of the RE series? For me, no.....but it is really fun. The direction is different but is still retains the elements that make Resident Evil classic. As I play through the rest of the series, I'll see if this new story arc is worth exploring.",Recommended

"Known as one of the most innovative 3rd person shooter titles of all time, I've always had a soft spot for this game. It manages to maintain a survival horror atmosphere while incorporating very tight mechanics. I find it difficult to reiterate the level of tension the game creates on an initial playthrough - it's something that needs to be experienced firsthand.\n\nThe story is a little on the weaker side of things, but it's got enough meat on the bones to keep you going further to see it through. A lot of cliche' twists, voiceovers that miss the mark from time to time, and a really annoying chick that will make you cringe every time she yells at you are among a few annoyances. These drawbacks don't really dimish the fun factor though. If anything, you may find yourself humoured by these shortcomings and brush them off during your time playing.\n\nFor completionists, expect a pretty tough tread through Professional difficulty (if this is your first exposure to the game that is). The difficulty feels progressive and balanced, so with persistance it's more than possible to achieve 100% without being a die-hard fan of the series.\n\nI would definitely recommend this game for fans of horror games, stealth games, or even shooting games in general. While it's not perfect by any means, Resident Evil 4 does an exceptional job at creating an immersive horror experience while producing a high level of tension for the player. It has the reputation it does for a reason.",Recommended
"Not exactly the hottest port or update, with the main difference being not so great new textures and a couple UI fixes for higher resolutions. Despite the base game being over 10 years old, there are some areas where frames dip even on a gtx 1080 @1080p There is also a complete lack of audio options. In spite of those shortcomings, it still runs well most of the time. KBM support works well enough with 2 options for mouse aiming, they both take getting used to, but either one should grant more precise aiming than the old gamepad once you've become accustomed. \n\nDespite the silly humor and cliche moments, it always finds a way to put you back into tense situations where only fast feet and sharp shots will save you.  And for the most part, that feeling of tension stay with you the whole game.  There's nary a dull moment with our hair-parting hero in the game's 12-16 hour long campaign.  In addition to the main campaign, there's also 2 smaller campaigns featuring RE2/4's Ada Wong and a Mercenaries mode that is basically a survival mode where you can choose your character and each character has their own loadout for you to experiment with. Overall, its a great game that has a LOT of replay value with it's main campaign and the Mercenaries mode.\n\nLooking toward the future, hopefully if they decide to do yet another port/remaster, (which they probably will knowing how many times they've already ported it, and during this age of remasters and reboots,) they'll do a complete overhaul and do it on the RE Engine that they used for RE7, not just a coat of paint with a couple more pixels on the textures and call it ""ultimate.""",Recommended

(You have to exit the game in windowed mode for some dumb reason & 3 years later Capcom has not fixed this bug)\n\nBefore DLC was ever a norm in videogames we used to have more gameplay in the extras menu like Mercenaries (Horde mode but with classic Resident Evil characters to play as like Wesker for example) & two Ada Wong story modes for example so I don't know why we don't get them anymore (DLC was a mistake) in games but I hope it makes a return in 2017 because I miss browsing through the extras menu to find bonus gameplay.\n\nIn the Ada Wong missions most of the cutscenes are not in HD but everything else in the game has HD textures & I'm a bit disappointed Capcom implemented the Xbox 360 achievements for this game.\n\n60 FPS is very smooth for shooting Ganados but for some odd reason QTEs are more annoying (especially for climbing & pressing the XC keyboard button combo for example) compared to the other versions of Resident Evil 4.\n\nNow to a bit of the game itself since we're done the PC port segment of Resident Evil 4.\n\nAshley is still annoying as hell 12 years later with her constant bitching & I don't know how Leon tolerates it because the island segment almost made my ears die a bit inside + I think in my personal opinion is the biggest flaw of this game is the fact the companion can't do anything useful at all besides cower at Ganados. (She does some useful things like [spoiler]driving the bulldozer[/spoiler] for example but that's all the credit I'll give her)\n\nExploration is still very strong in this game with the amount of treasure & guns you can collect, Boss battle design is still intense (Even on Pro mode too), inventory management is crucial for everything, puzzles are balanced (This is one of the few games where I'm fine with slider puzzles) & the merchant is still a mystery (I don't know if Capcom will ever reveal his identity at all) but there have been theories about him. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAldeHbJkW0\n\nHere's a bit of trivia about this version of Resident Evil 4 apparently Ashley's breast physics were toned down. (To be honest I'm too busy shooting to care about this tiny feature but it does suck that Japan censored this game) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23WNqVBZyGE\n\nMy favourite weapons for the game itself are the Red 9, Blacktail, Striker, P.R.L. 412, Broken Butterfly, Killer7 (Same name as Suda51's game on the Gamecube), TMP, Rifle, Semi-auto Rifle, Knife (In Resident Evil 1-3 the knife is useless but in this game it's your best friend), Bowgun, Infinite Launcher & the Chicago Typewriter.\n\nSome hardcore fans of Resident Evil wouldn't like the infinite typewriter saves in Resident Evil 4 but I personally don't mind it at all & the story itself is good but nothing too special (I like fighting the Plagas parasite) but the gameplay has inspired other videogames after it's release 12 years ago. (I'm disappointed that there's not much backstory on Krauser himself in this game)\n\nOverall I highly recommend this game & I'm hoping Resident Evil 7 when it's released on January 24th will go back to it's survival horror roots because even though I started the series on the 5th game I've been very disappointed at how distant the story has become thanks to Capcom's greed.\n\nIf you think I missed anything at all in my review feel free to comment.\n\nEDIT: Resident Evil 7 is a success to both Capcom & gamers http://nichegamer.com/2017/01/27/resident-evil-7-ships-2-5-million-series-tops-75-million/\n\nhttp://nichegamer.com/2017/02/10/resident-evil-7-ships-3-million-worldwide/",Recommended

"I never got around to playing Resident Evil 4 when it originally came out on the Gamecube so I was happy when they announced the Ultimate HD Edition. In fact, the only Resident Evil game I've beaten is 5, and I watched a friend play through the first one in its entirety, so having only really experienced those two, I wasn't sure what to expect with 4. I know it received massive acclaim when it was released because it completely changed the formula for the series, so I was kind of expecting something a bit less.... cliched. This game is just full of cliches and goes on to make fun of those cliches. It's kind of surreal.\n\nI think Leon is arguably the coolest character in the Resident Evil series and the writers definitely know that when they decided he was going to be a government agent after the Raccoon City events. He's sly and makes stupid puns, but is intelligent and quick thinking. The fact that he's sent to find the President's daughter in a Spanish village sounds normal enough. But things are obviously not normal when he gets there. The game starts off like a survival horror, but immediately, I stopped being terrified as it was clear that there's more action for our ""action hero"". Leon is ultimately painted as an action hero, and boy oh boy, the in game villains can not stop referencing that. The basic story is that, as I've stated, he's sent by the US to find the President's recently captured daughter, Ashley Graham (she's quite the character too) and he does it, obviously. There's more to this village though, they've been all infected by some parasite, Las Plagas. Instead of the slow, dreary zombies, we have psychopathic Spanish people that wanna kill you. As the game progresses, you face different variations of these people as well as the people in the cult that are behind it and some military types. It gets pretty weird really fast. I mean, this game blends the survival horror trope with weird religious cult attitude and a high conspiracy plot potentially involving Umbrella. It's loads of fun but definitely off the walls insane. Which is exactly why I love it. The gameplay is a huge shift from the first three Resident Evil titles and the completely bizarre setting is what makes it so unique. Plus Ada is in it and she's so cool. Like, really, they could have called this game ""Resident Cool"" because all of the coolest characters are in this game.\n\n9.5/10",Recommended

"In resident evil 4, special agent Leon S. Kennedy is sent on a mission to rescue the U.S. President’s daughter who has been kidnapped. Finding his way to a rural village in Europe, he faces new threats that are a departure from the traditional lumbering zombie enemies of the earlier instalments in the series.\n\nAnd I like this game because of these elements:\n1.I have bought this game since the ps2 version out.It's my special childhood when play as Smokeweed Leon,rescue President's Daughter Ashley Graham and pass through chapters and defeat Saddler the leader\n2.New enhanced HD graphics and some textures have been replaced with Higher Definition textures (but it's not perfect alot,you can try the HD project of Cris and Albert right here [url=http://steamcommunity.com/app/254700/discussions/0/558749824370582987/]here[/url])\n3.Cool story\n\nThings need to be improve:\n1.Slow Motion Fix\n2.Optimize for lower graphics card like Intel HD \n\nSo I recommended you to buy this game as a part of ps2,xbox 360 gamers childhood.Enjoy",Recommended
"One of the top ten games of all time, with ease. Probably number six to be precise! If you play at least six games in your life, let one of them be Resident Evil 4. And play it at least twice.\n\nIt is a perfect, sublime, mindblowingly good game. Timeless like CastleVania or Mega Man 2, it's mechanics, moving just a bit to dodge a lumbering guy with an axe, the quick turn, it's unique compared to what people expect from a third person shooter these days. But for me it did not take long to get back into it's groove, and there ain't nothing wrong with what they're doing here.\n\nAnd of course the atmosphere, the fun dialogue, the soundtrack, the generous length of the adventure campaign, extra Ada stuff, it's like a picnic for the fan of intense gamery. A damn fine picnic! Thumbs way up, Shinji Mikami thank you sir, I salute you for directing this masterpiece. And by the way this port is really good, it's like there's a super HD version of the Gamecube right in my PC! Hell of a game.",Recommended
Great game.,Recommended
"It’s the pacing and variety of the game that I love. It’s non-stop excitement for about 16-18 hours, taking you from that opening village to a gigantic castle full of impossible contraptions and eventually, an exploding island. The first time through, I never saw any of those set-pieces coming. It’s a thrillride, and at its best on PC.",Recommended
do not buy this crap unless you like 1950's game play and looks,Not Recommended
"If you're new to the Resident Evil series, this is definitely the game you should start off with. \n\nIn traditional RE fashion, the story is a total B-list horror/action with little to look into. You (Leon Kennedy) are sent to somewhere in rural Spain to find the President's daughter who was kidnapped by terrorists. I won't spoil the major plot twists, but let's just say they really don't add much to the story. However, you'd have to be severely autistic to buy any RE game for its story, so it's all about the gameplay! Tank controls aside, this is a really fun game to play tactically and the atmosphere created by the environments can really suck you in. *** MINOR SPOILER AHEAD *** After rescuing Amy, the game becomes a spooky baby sitting sim. Thankfully, like any good babysitter, all you need to do is lock her in a box and go about your business. So it's not really that frustrating, but the fact that it's there is kind of a turnoff for me. \n\nMy main problem with this game is just the port itself: Whenever I exit the game my computer black-screens and I have to restart it. I know Capcom really doesn't give two squirts of piss about this game anymore, but still. If you're going to make a PC port make sure it works properly :l\n\nAnyway, due to the port I have to give this game an 8/10 rather than a 9.",Recommended
"Resident Evil 4. \nI thoroughly enjoyed playing this with mouse and keyboard support, aiming is infinitely easier and more fun (faster and more precise and easier to control), even though I first played this on ps2. \nController support is also there. You can switch between/use both seemlessly, which is always nice in any game (seriously, the more games should implement this, the better). \nI tend to use the mouse in RE4 now, despite starting on ps2, and even though I use a controller for RE5. \n\nCurrently only the character models are remastered in HD, but there are very nice HD reskins in the works that are making the entire game look better, improving all the textures by 8-16x and so on. http://www.re4hd.com/\n\nGame is optimized well. \nDespite the long awaited 'being able to move and shoot' in RE6, 4 and 5 remain better games. \nMercenaries is a fun arcade mode that adds replay value as well, then you have 'Seperate Ways' and 'Assignment Ada'; short, but extra campaigns. \nCampaign/professional mode and mercenaries are the meat and potatoes. Unlocking the super weapons is fun and rewarding. After using them for a while you'll want to go back to starting over with more regular weapons for a challenge, or playing mercenaries. \nA lot of people apparently joke about the story of this one, while it's not without its cliches and perhaps a few laughable moments, it's not bad at all; I've always liked what of a story is there. \nGreat game. \nSome people complain controlling your character, or, the ""over the shoulder"" aspect is clunky, but you just have to learn and get used to how to do it, once you do, it is much, much less difficult. It's just different than most games control scheme at first. But you should seriously, for the experience and the legend of this gaming history, play through this game. Personally I love it and it creates a great, unique and very memorable atmosphere. \n\nMakes RE4 better in more ways than one, so 10/10. \n* Not recommended for chopper pilots named Mike or police embassy border escorts.",Recommended
"An absolute classic that stood the test of time!\nIt's rare to see a third person shooter with so many strategic elements.\nJust expect less horror and more tension and you'll have a great time.\n\nThe mouse and keyboard controls are a bit iffy, though, so it's best played with a gamepad.",Recommended

"RE4 might of turned the series in a more action oriented route rather than horror but you simply cant deny this is a damn good game. Few issues though:  The implementation of mouse movement is absolutely dreadfull as it simply acts as an emulated thumbstick which causes camera glitches and causes the camera to snap back to center whenever you try to look left or right, up and down, Secondly framedrops on a GTX 780 simply make no sense. Thankfully these drops only last for 2-3 seconds and dont intrude on the experience all that much. \n\nOverall highly recommended, RE4 is an absolute classic.",Recommended

"\nThis game may have a great storyline and whatever else but the game-breaking controls are absolutely deadset horrendous. I have never come across a game with such clunky, awkward and at times simply unplayable controls. \n(I am using keyboard/mouse at the moment and will revisit this game once I have purchsed a controller of some sort. However, that will not be in the near future)\nWhoever thought it was a good idea to be unable to move whilst aiming has most likely never played a shooter-type game in their entire lives. And let's make no mistake, Resident Evil 4 *-IS-* a shooter. Bad guys in the way. Player shoots them all dead. Player progresses through the game. There is no option to circumvent incidents of conflict. \nIt makes absolutely no sense at all. A United States Special Agent tasked with rescuing the daughter of the President has a hard time facing village peasants armed with farming tools simply because the controls do not reflect the characters training as that of a Special Agent. \nNever before have I been so utterly disappointed in the way in which a seemingly great game is downright unplayable due to horrendously bad controls. \nNot recommended.",Not Recommended

The game has very few options in terms of graphical quality or really anything else, but runs smooth without any issues most of the time. The only real bug I ever noticed was that for some reason, my FPS dropped significantly when reloading a rifle (but no other weapon).

"Something I've heard numerous times about this game is that it is the game that destroyed the franchise, and to that I have to say that I disagree. Sure, it is definitely more action-oriented than the previous installments, but that doesn't mean this game was to blame. The only thing we can place any blame on is Capcom itself. They chose to go to the weird, annoying, and filled-to-the-brim-with-action-for-a-quick-buck styel of RE5 and RE6. In order to really enjoy this game, you need to focus only on what the game itself is: fantastic.\n\nFor one, this game is the one that really spawned the over-the-shoulder style that we see in so many popular games and franchises today such as Gears of War, Tom Clancy's The Division, and Dead Space, just to name a few. \n\nThere are many other things this game inspired, but I don't want this review to be too lengthy as I have very much to say about it. One of my favorite elements of the game is how no more than 15 minutes in, the terror is already being set in. You get chased by a horde of Ganados, a couple of them being the Chainsaw Man, and you have very limited ammo to fight them off with. You already have the possibility of a one-shot kill by the Chainsaw Man a few minutes in and for me, it was absolutely terrifying. \n\nAnother extremely notable thing about this game is the atmosphere. This game's sound and color design make it just that one notch more terrifying than it would normally be, most notably in my opinion when we run into the Bella Sisters for the first time. Just hearing them wielding their chainsaws and listening to their frantic, maniacal shrieks sent many a shiver down my spine. \n\nNow, I know there are flaws with this game, of course. One of the most notable flaws is the sudden change in tone in the middle of the game from a grimy, dark hick town invaded by people whose minds are being ontrolled to being in a nice, clea, and well-lit castle, still containing people with their minds being controlled. It's a fairly unwelcome change, I know, but it still maintains it's place as my personal favorite game of the franchise. \n\nAnother thing I found extremely pointless was Hunnigan. I honestly felt that there was no point to her being there other than to tell you what to do next. She was very annoying and interrupted the flow of the game a lot, so I often just skip her cutscenes and figure out what I'm supposed to do on my own. \n\nOverall, even with it's flaws, this game is a masterpiece and is my personal favorite game in the Resident Evil franchise. \n\nIf I had to give this game a rating, I would give it a 98/100. This game will scare the crap out of you, but keep you playing all the same. Definitely worth the buy.",Recommended
"Being my first game in the Resident Evil series, I had different expectations after trying the RE7 playable demo. I was pleasantly suprised, however, to find a third person shooter unlike any I have played before, and is without a doubt the best I've ever played. What the game lacks in graphical fidelity, it makes up for im ambiance, mood and immersion. The world, despite having relatively dated textures, has a dark theme that perfectly fits the desired effect the game as a whole produces, with its intense music, risky combat, and overall ""survival"" tone. RE4 is one of the few horror games where I actually found myself planning my upgrade path and managing my supplies and weapons. Each weapon is very unique, and provides a different feel to combat situations. The combat is clunky, but purposely done so in a way to make you think about your shots. The controls are a little wonky on pc, as it is very clear this game was intended to be played with a controller, so I definitely reccomend using one if you can. Quick time events seem to be a problem on M/K, as more than a few occasions I found myself restarting a QTE over and over again because even though I was spamming ""X"", it wasn't really registering. Boss fights are extremely varied, and none of them felt like a chore although I wish they were a little more challenging. Ammo management is pretty easy to manage for the first two thirds of the game, but becomes a problem later in the game which can turn some players away, but I never found myself completely out of ammo.  Overall Resident Evil 4 was an extremely enjoyable experience, with an incredibly atmospheric setting to back up solid shooting gameplay. \n\nPros: \n+INCREDIBLY well deisgned world and atmosphere, especially in the first area.\n+Excelent progression system designed to make you think.\n+Exhilarating combat, forcing you to pick and choose your shots.\n+Survival aspects work very well, forcing you to carefully manage your inventory, health and ammo.\n+Interesting story, although I haven't played enough of the other games to really appreciate the plot.\n+Decently long, I beat it in about 16 hours of gameplay. You will not want to play anything else until you complete this game, it is very addicting.\n\nCons: \n-Messy mouse and keyboard controls, was obviously designed for a controller\n-Dated textures (not bad textures, the game certainly has a classic charm but the relatively poor graphics may turn some people off)\n\nOverall Score: 10/10 Must buy, the best 3rd person shooter I've ever played.  \n",Recommended

"I have only a few games I find myself constantly coming back to and Resident Evil 4 happens to be one of them. Years and years ago when I first played it I had such a bad computer that the game kept lagging badly even on the lowest possible settings. But I didn't mind because I had such a good time.\n\nThe story begins when special agent Leon S. Kennedy, a survivor of Raccoon City, is given a task of finding the daughter of United State's president. She was kidnapped by unknown assailants and taken somewhere deep within Spain. Our hero Leon arrives to the destination but comes to learn the hard way that his mission is yet again going to be anything but simple. Except this time he will not face zombies but villagers entagled in a strange cult.\n\nRE4 became well-known for its change of direction compared to previous games. Moving a little away from horror the gameplay features more action and gunplay. Point of view also changed from fixed camera angles to third-person to better reflect the big transformation. Though there are lots more enemies and bullets than before, you can't be wasteful with your items and hence the survival horror. Inventory management is  necessary and your Tetris skills will come handy.\n\nSome fans of the original Resident Evil games didn't like what the franchise was shaping up to be; major concern that the charming horror was changing to typical action. I can understand this perfectly well as someone who has seen their beloved video games change into something I didn't like them for. But at the same time I really love RE4 and its different gameplay. I like the balance of horror and action (although admittedly there's less of the horror). One chapter you're shooting groups of crazy villagers and dodging their axes and dynamites, and then some other chapter you're getting ambushed behind a corner by a really creepy, red-eyed monster which can regenerate its limbs. I don't find the game scary but the atmosphere is intense and spooky. And no matter how many times I have played, the red-eyed monsters Regenerators still manage to make me feel nervous and uncomfortable.\n\nAnd the gameplay has various elements to keep it interesting: you kill different enemies in different locations (very well designed enemies), solve some puzzles to get a reward or open a passage (not too many and not too hard, often very subtle like a mechanism to open a door), find treasure and money to buy and upgrade weapons (who doesn't like to buy stuff) and slay a few bosses along the way. And after you've played through the campaign once you unlock a bunch of mini-games if you're left wanting more.\n\nWhile I absolutely love RE4, I can say it is not without a few grivances. The top 20 ""Most annoying characters in video game history"" has to include the subject of your rescue, Ashley. You have to escort this defenseless, complaining, adult-acting-like-a-child around while protecting both of your lives. I'm sure many have felt the same as I have, wanting to shut her up with a bullet even if it results in a game over.\n\nThe Steam version is supposed to be the best version out of them all, which by now there's so many (GameCube, PS2, Wii etc), but it isn't as good as it should be for an 'Ultimate HD Edition'. The 60 frames per second is a huge plus, and in my opinion the best thing to come out of this edition, but there's a couple of bad things to list. Textures still look very awful because they didn't bother to upgrade them properly, unlike the two guys on the forums who are in a process of doing it on their free time. And I really would like to know why there's no subtitles if the language is set in English, only if it's in any other language. For personal reasons subtitles are a must for me and it's always a disappointment to find there's none. \n\nLastly, the controls definitely take time to get used to. RE4 differs in many ways from the previous games and you have more freedom than before with the aiming and the camera, but everything still feels quite tanky. This can deter some people as controls are perhaps the most important part of any video game. I can't say what it's like playing with a keyboard and a mouse but with a Xbox 360 controller I didn't have much trouble.\n\nBut at the end of the day Resident Evil 4 reinvented the franchise in a way which made me, and many others, fall in love with it and time and time again it has been considered as one of the best video games of all time. Even today it holds up well and I don't think I'll ever stop liking it. The port isn't the greatest, and it needed more work, but the gameplay is fun and advanced for its time. If you can get past the weird controls at least at first, I hope you can enjoy playing as much as I have.\n\n[h1]Personal Rating: 10/10[/h1]",Recommended

I'm not into horror games but the gameplay of this is very satisfying. It's the first game I got 100% steam achievements on and I've played it through multiple times. It's probably the best RE game if you're not a huge fanboy of the series and I recommend giving it a chance if you enjoy single player games. The aiming is a bit different but it's not bad once you get used to it. \n\nI did a bit of research and it seems like the PC version is the best one content and functionality wise which is another incentive to pick this up.,Recommended

"You are Leon S Kennedy, sent to rescue the president's daughter from an isolated village. Something is wrong with the villagers, however...\n\nResident Evil 4 is the paramount survial horror title that inspired countless classic horror games (The Evil Within, Dead Space). The atmosphere in this game is almost unmatchable. Despite being released close to 20 years ago, the game holds up great. The story is intruguing and has classic RE gameplay with a new 3D perspective. The gunplay isn't terrible -- easy to learn, but hard to master. Managing your inventory space is creative and ammo is scarce, so headshots make all the difference. Boss fights are fun and fair. Overall, the game rocks, and this is one of the few titles i've completed that I still occasionally visit in my backlog.\n\nFirstly, this is the best port of RE4 to date. The HD visuals hold up nicely and really help bring out the creepy atmosphere that this game is known for. The controlls may seem a bit weird at first (it is a console port after all, from gamecube to eventually PC) but are quick to get used to. Hours of content and bonus chapters are included, definitly worth picking up for 7 dollars if you grab it on sale. One of the best and most complete horror expierences available in a video game, a Recommended must play. The main campaign is about 12-16 hours depending on how good you are at third person shooters; but their is two add on campaigns that add to the story/lore and a minigame ""mercenary"" mode, which brings total play time closer to 20 hours. \n\nThe game is extremely fun to play and has clearly inspiried many other 3rd person shooters, the gunplay is satisfying but a low ammo count will always keep you on your toes. The fact that the game automatically makes the game harder or easier based on how your doing is way ahead of its time, and really helps soldify the expierence. Combine that with an intruging story and you have a reciepe for success. \n\nThat being said, this game clearly has optimization issues -- the console port has some akward controls that take time to get used to, and theres a bug near the endgame that crashes the game where there isn't a typerwriter to save for sometime. \n\nIf you can't find your resolution in the graphic settings you need to re-install your video card drivers (it only supports what your video card recognizes), online posts state that you can edit an .ini to fix it but it doesn't seem to work correctly (and the UI is still in whatever the game believes your resolution is). \n\nIf you want visuals of what the game looks like, check below, some bosses are shown so *spoiler alert*\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=831107886\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=836538909\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=831107803",Recommended
"The only game in my library without a capitalised title.\nI'd write a review here but I can't stop staring at that apparent lack of effort in the title.\n\nOh, I have to write something useful?\nIt's pretty much the prototypical Resident Evil game, with it's tank controls and not-quite-free camera.\nFor the unititiated RE games are all about inventory shuffling, hoping you have enough bullets to avoid panicky melee, and locational damage allowing finisher moves.\n\nThis is a re-remake of a gamecube game but even in 'Original Graphics' mode it still looks perfectly serviceable. I encountered some slowdown that appeared unrelated to the overall potato power of my system, but on the whole it plays a lot smoother than it did on release.\n\nIn actuality I still can't help but stare at the uncapitalised name. I find that it fits with the overall nature of this remaster.\n\nVery little 'remastering' beyond HD textures, and not enough damns given to even capitalise a title.\nBut it didn't need it, so long as it's functioning at least as well as the Gamecube 'exclusive' that was too good to stay exclusive, It's still a great example of what fun survival horror can be when it takes the story like a b-movie and lets you shoot monks in the knees for a tactical german suplex.",Recommended

"This review has completely been revised!\nTl;Dr; Had problems with it working in fullscreen but is fine in window mode finally with minor problems, still don't recommend if you have problems with it like me.\n\nOriginally I had posted raging that this game had a lot of problems and I was upset about purchasing, blah bah. I am still a little upset because I have to play it in windowed mode to not experience the biggest hassle but I [i][b]guess[/b][/i] it's okay. I'm glad I didn't pay full price for this but I really do wish I can play it in full screen without problems. \n\nMy previous problems with this game was that I was unable to hear certain sound effects such as kicking in doors or gunshots but I could hear voices of the characters and enemies or vice versa but I wasn't able to hear all of the sound effects working properly together. The second problem I had was that in full screen I was unable to exit the game through the menu, task manager or even Alt+F4. I also tried Alt+Enter and the game wouldn't minimize. This game made me feel like my new setup was broken and I was so frustrated.\n\nHowever, those problems have been solved to an extent. I am able to play the game with no problems as far as sound effects being missing if I play in window mode but I still have a problem with my cursor getting stuck in the window and my desktop not recognizing any command other than opening the steam overlay. I am also unable to play in full screen because I am still unable to close out of it properly, I have tried twice since my first rambling and the first time the game tried to close and all I got was a black screen that I was unable to open the steam overlay nor task manager or any other command. The second time the game just wouldn't quit at all and the 'quit' button just stared back at me pulsating. \n\nOverall, if you're the majority of people who have some nostalgia with this title and have no problems with it running then enjoy your game and your many sound effects and your full HD full screen experience! However, I had to go through an annoying ordeal to play this and I ended up not playing much because of it and my partner is playing this instead and from what I hear it's a good game, but I can't comment much on that. Because of my personal experience with this title I still have to back my original negative review and if anything changes I will update this in the future.",Not Recommended

"[h1]Resident Evil 4 Review[/h1]\n[b]by KTMboyz[/b]\n\n[i]""Welcome Stranger...""[/i]\n\nI could go as far as to say this is the most intense game I've ever played!  Resident Evil 4 is awesome!  It's a survival horror TPS and hell, does it ever do it right.  The gameplay is fantastic; you'll be killing insane villagers, solving puzzles and managing your inventory the whole time.  The story is simple enough, you play as Leon from Resident Evil 2 as you try to rescue the president's daughter in a rural spanish town.  Suprisingly, no zombies for a Resident Evil game!  Anyway, with slow-moving enemies, limited inventory space and great sounds, this game will keep you stressed and worried the whole time, only for you to laugh out loud whenever you die, somewhat relieved...

"As a child, I always heard about Capcom's Resident Evil as being a horror/thriller series. Resident Evil 4 for PS2 was one of the most popular at the time and unfortunately I was not able to get a copy. This is the first Resident Evil I've ever played and even though it is the fourth it is not necessary to know any backstory (unless you are really interested in Resident Evil's universe as a whole).\nWhat really stood out for me the most was the gameplay. It is a third person shooter, but it has its singularities. The camera's positioning and aim are unique for the style of the game. Being a mix of horror and action, it delivers both of them amazingly. I had a lot of moments of spookness and despair as I had moments of excitement and joy.\nThe plot is pretty cool. It is compelling and funny. There are some predictable twists but the game as a whole makes those little mistakes forgiveable.\nFinally, few things of the game that I really did not like was some bugs on the AI (Enemies sometimes stop moving or reacting at all) and  a few but annoying glitches (Boss battle where the boss does not go through the doors).\nOverall, I give this game solid 8.5/10. If you like third person shooters, likes a simple but stable plotline and overall a good buy, this game is for you.",Recommended

"Combat is amazing. Enemies are extremely well designed and there is good variation within each level and area. Even the regular guys upgrade from axes and pitchforks to grenades, flails, shields, helmets (no headshots), and crossbows. I can't stress enough, the interesting and varied enemies are the #1 reason to play this game. Bosses are interesting as well, but sometimes they include Quick Time Events. QTEs also happen during cutscenes and simply once you enter into an area.\n\nStory is excellent, but the acting is hammy. \n\nThere are also minor puzzles featured in the game. Many are optional in order to secure treasure; many puzzles allow access to the next area (required). Most puzzles are well-designed and there is very little repetition of puzzle type.\n\nWeapon switching and healing is all handled within a pause menu. \n\nCertain key bindings can't be remapped - the keys to move and rotate items in your inventory. Try Delete, Insert, PgUp, and PgDown. (Btw, Delete doesn't delete the item.)\n\nLeon controls like a car; there is no strafing, only turning and moving forward/back. It's weird. You just have to get used to it. You have to ready your weapon before you can attack, so Leon feels a little slow.

"Pretty much an amazing game, overall best in the franchise. \n\nPort is apparently bad, but ive had almost no problems, other than some frame drops at later on parts of the game.\n\nStory is idiotic, but no one cares except for the die-hard resident evil fans, which i am not, so i personally love the campy, cliche, cheesy action / thriller vibe it gives off.\n\nControls as good as it can on keyboard and mouse, which is the superior control in this scenario.\n\nAround a 12 hour campaign with close to an extra 4 hours of bonus content.\n\nThe merchant is the best character to ever be featured in any form of media ever. That is a fact.\n\nVoice acting is....good enough i guess, nothing to write home about.\n\nAudio is generally good, might ocasionally have a sound file that sounds like it was recorded on a nokia phone, but most of it has been spit-shined.\n\nQTEs suck though, at one point i had to flip my keyboard sideways and act as if i had parkinsons to be able to pass one.\n\nReplayability is decent, alternate difficulties sure do make it a slightly different experience, also mods. \n\nCant move while reloading, which is agonizing when fighting against the high value targets.\n \nOverall great game, no matter what you do make sure this game is in your library at some point.",Recommended

"I have somewhat fond memories of this game from the Playstation (I think), but now that I've bought it I remember what I really hated about it back then - the control system. Oh. My. God. Could anyone have found a less responsive way to control a shooter character? I discourage anyone from buying this because while the game itself is pretty decent for its age, and the HD rework has been quite good, the controls are TERRIBLE. It's clearly a game written for a controller, and when ported to PC they simply couldn't be bothered implementing a normal mouse-look system. It would be SO much easier without this rotate char left/rotate char right/Q to quick 180 crap. Seriously guys? Could you just not be arsed? Well done. Totally ruined the PC port. Also, the inventory system is utterly unintuitive. I'm holding a pistol with 1 bullet in it, carrying 60 rounds in my inventory, and I can't reload, I can't combine ammo and pistol, and to be honest, I really can't be bothered trying to work it out. \n\nRefund Please.",Not Recommended

"Resident Evil 4, Review by dcw999\nI highly recommend this game to anyone at around £5 while on sale it's a absolute steal and one of the few games I class as a timeless masterpiece.\n\nThe story follows Leon S. Kennedy, 6 years after the events of Resident Evil 2, sent to rescue the President's daughter Ashley Graham who was kidnapped by a mysterious cult; where he must travel to Spain in a attempt to save her.\n\nPros:\n-  The gunplay is sound feeling nice to fire all of Leon's arsenal.\n-  There is alot of replay value to the game with unlockable infinite ammo weapons through completing the game on          different difficulties, Resident Evils staple Mercenaries mode and extra story content unlocked once beating the game which in today's standards would be tacked on as DLC.\n-  The game invokes tension through it's blend of action and horror which was new to Resident Evil at this point, with the feeling of being overwhelmed by a huge number of enemies and or getting charged by tougher enemies like Chainsaw maniacs or even enemies that can regenerate their limbs, the game does a great job at making people feeling hopeless and challenged.\n-  Although this is a horror action game if on the higher difficulties ammo and healing items become more scarce requiring the player to carefully think about engagements with the enemies in attempts to conserve  ammo for more dangerous encounters.\n\nCons: \n-  (Not really a con about this game, just the effect this game had on the series) Resident Evil 4 was considered the beginning of the end to a great series as from this game Capcom thought the people wanted a more action heavy experience with the likes of Resident Evil 5, 6 and some of the spin-offs.\n-  The Player can't move and shoot at the same time, to more modern players this could be a turn-off to them as it can feel outdated and clunky.  However personally I believe it adds to the horror and the tension of the game having to choose when to shoot and when to run.\n- Despite being the ""Ultimate HD Edition"".  Graphically the game does show its age in certain locations with some textures, mods can be used to fix these and make the game look even better than the Vanilla version does.\n\nOverall, this is a great game for anyone to try and for low price this game is definitely worth the pick up.  It manages to blend both horror and action to scarily good results.  It is not required for you to play the other games to grasp this story however returning fans will benefit with a returning cast of loved characters and new ones.  This is one of my all time favorite games and a must pick up for all those that love games as I called it before, it's a timeless classic. I rate this game 10/10  \nIf you want to play any games message me on Steam.\nWhy not check out my Youtube Channel: dcw999, for video content and why not comment what you want to see.",Recommended

"[h1]Third Person Shooter Survival Horror Game[/h1]\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6xXHCnvXUU\n+ The gameplay itself is great, especially if you are looking for a zombie-like horror survival game to really get your heart pounding. You will mostly be alone traveling around while being hunted by tons of creatures in very horror-esque settings.\n+ Very atmospheric sounds and music which really helped to create suspenseful moments all throughout the game\n+ The story was good although not special. You play as Leon a US agent sent to Spain to recover the kidnapped President's Daughter Ashley from a group known as the Los Iluminados. This group has been essentially infecting people with mind-controlling parasites, and also experimenting on humans to create abominations. \n+ Boss battles are absolutely fantastic. Every boss is a unique encounter that involves facing some truly large and terrifying creatures. Each one is entirely different, and include some thrilling fights.\n+ Controls (while also being a negative explained below) makes the game extremely challenging, but at the same time very rewarding. I started the game despising the control scheme as you are unable to move while aiming, and aiming in itself can be very difficult. Although, as I pushed through the game, I started to actually appreciate what the developers were going for as the restricting controls make every encounter dangerous. Even regular enemies can be devestating if they catch you off guard, which really brings out the horror element of the game.\n+ Great variety of enemies. You will be constantly fighting new creatures throughout the game which keeps the game feeling fresh the entire way through, especially considered every enemy is a threat which you have to learn to take out efficiently.\n+ A nice selection of weapons to unlock and upgrade. Each weapon tends to have a specific use as well which will have you constantly switch between them during most battles. (Example, Shotgun is great at close range as it has high knockback and dmg, Pistol is good at medium range, Rifle at longrange, etc.)\n+ Loot & Exploration is absolutely amazing in Resident Evil 4. I was CONSTANTLY looking all over the place for treasure, ammo, and money which can all be traded into the shop to buy wepaons, upgrades, and supplies. It is so rewarding, and almost mandatory to explore as the game's difficulty really requires you to upgrade as much as possible. \n+ I may have mentioned this above, but this game is DIFFICULT. It is not a walk in the park, even on easy you will likely die a number of times as a new player to the series. To me, this is a great thing as a sense of challenge always makes the experience far more rewarding.\n+ Many mini-games, puzzles,  and side events to break up the mindless shooting. \n+ Lots of content. About 12-15hours+ in length (including 3 bonus missions after you beat the game)  \n\n\n- Pacing is a bit slow at some points throughout the game as it consistantly has you go through maze-like labyrinths which involve a fair bit of back tracking.  (At some points I was just like ""Aghhh I just want to get out of here!)\n- The story objectives get a bit skewed about half-way through the game.  At one point you are supposed to be waiting for a rescue helicopter for Ashley (The Presidents Daughter)...but end up getting side tracked and going into a dangerous Castle to fight some ultimately unimportant enemies.\n- The controls are entirely different from any other shooter. They can be very difficult to learn, and often frustrating to new players as simply aiming can be extremely challenging. This is heightened by the fact that there's no way to change the control scheme or to change the movement sensitivity of your controller.\n- You can't move your character while aiming or reloading, and there is no dodge or roll mechanic. This is a bit annoying to me, as you tend to fight in very small rooms or corridors making it very easy to get hit or damaged.\n\n~ Just a personal nitpick, but they should have let you buy ammo from the shop. Part of the game consists of being low on ammo and using it wisely, so they decided not to make ammo widely available....",Recommended
"This was the first Resident Evil game i've played and boy oh boy was it...\nGOOD! \nREALLY GOOD! \nIf you can get past the clunky ""Tank Controls"" and the relatively dated graphics then there really shouldn't be a reason for you not to pick this game up. I've always wanted to play it and I finally got the chance. This review will consist of several categories. \n\n- Story -\nThe introductory sequence got me hooked quickly and the escalating plotline kept me interested all the way through. There are a few memos scattered around here and there that requires reading (I know that might sound disheartening as many of you prefer not to read through walls of text, but please bear with it), but they all add to the plot and further the story. The story is fairly self contained, dropping hints to earlier games, but not heavily relying on them. The writing can get a little cheesy here and there, but the overall feel of the game is very unique.\n\n- Gameplay - \nAs stated earlier, the game has ""Tank Controls"". That means you have to turn Leon manually around. It is not your typical third-person shooter where you can instantly snap from enemy to enemy. This adds to the horror element, as you have to plan ahead when you encounter different threats. Sometimes you might get screwed over in a tight corridor and sometimes you might get a horde after you in an open area. You have to think on how to deal with each situation in your own way. Not only that, but there are tons of ways on how to customize your weapon. Exploring is encouraged through upgrades and new weapons. \n\nNow people tend to complain on Ashley. After a while this game turns into a really convoluted escort mission. Nobody likes those. Nobody. Escort missions are a pain in the arse with bad AI, but in this case I don't really have much to complain about. Ashley follows you really closely and there were only a few times that she got in harms way due to poor AI. The rest of the time it was all my fault if she died or got left behind. \n\n- Graphics - \nFor a game that was released on the gamecube, only to be HD remastered later this is a deceptivley good looking game. I'd say it is on par with Dark Souls: Prepare to Die Edition, if not better when it comes to the graphics department. If you don't like grey/brown/black games then this is not for you as the game has a very gray/dirty palette. I thought they facial animations were okay and the overall feel of each area was unique. Even when only working with grey colours. \n\n- Complaints -\nThe enemies could sometimes get very repetetive and bland. The game becomes less and less scary the more you play it. Some of the puzzles were a little too easy for my tastes. \n\n- My final verdict - \nIf you want a fun yet scary game then buy Resident Evil 4. I played through the entire game over the span of two days (7 hours per day) and it had me hooked to no end. I can understand why people who have played it before praise it so dearly. If I had to rate this game it would be a solid 9/10. A great game!",Recommended
"We all know RE4 is a good game. You need a controller and just struggle through the first 2hrs or so before you start to grasp the controls. After that, you'll begin to see just how great this game is. Also make sure you install the RE4 HD Project mod. This makes the game look WAY better. It's one of the best graphical mods for any game I've seen. Also keep in mind this game crashes a lot when you're loading into new areas. I'd recommend just bypassing the save system entirely, and making your own saves. If the game runs well for you and you are confident that you don't need other saves then go ahead, but for me, I have to use them just to avoid losing a ton of progress each crash.\n\nRE2 Remake/RE7 > RE4.",Recommended

"So the game starts off with the blonde dude from el dorado getting lost in spain during the 1500's (I think?) while he is looking for some chick with tig ol' bitties. After [strike] kindly [/strike] asking the locals where he may find said boobies, he is locked up with the actor from mission impossible. Then he decides to go fishing, pet a couple of dogies, and remove a tumor from the big friendly giant. At this point, justin bieber is haveing an internal crises and decides to go to church and, what do ya know, big booty Bertha was here the whole time!1! Then they meet the pope, but in this universe the pope is actually the main vilian from assassins creed so he's a dick. Then they run allllllllll around the place and kill a bunch of dudes cause this game is rated M for Masacure and they find Tom Cruise again and then Tom emidiently leaves again, and then they remove another tumor from another giant (this game is actually the spiritual secsessor to surgion simulator) and then they fight the villiage cheese because he was actully ugly or something aND THE VILLIAGE CHSSES IS LIKE ""THIS ISNT EVEN MY FINALE FORM"" AND HE BREAKS OUT INTO HIVES AND HIS STOMACH GOES *CROOSHCI* AND HES LIKE TRYING TO KILL BRAD PITT AND THE WHOLE PLACE IS ON FIRE CASUE SOMEONE DROPPED MY MIXTAPE AND BRADD IS LIKE ""YIPPEEKYAY MOTHERF-"" AND THE WHOLE PLACE BLOWS UP AND THEn he gets the dragon ball. At this point, the locals dont want justin beebs in the villiage anymore so they chase him and his biotch to the nearby castle and the burger king comes out and hes like ""who were you excpeting, sportaflop?"" So now mario is running all around peaches castle trying to get the 210 stars or something and then he gets separated from peach but then he finds her again, also the pope kills Tom Cruise (looks like this mission...was impossible *laugh bit*). Lets see, what else happens, uhhhhh the dudes ex girlfriend shows up and leaves and shows up again and leaves and ummmm the princess is captured again and then you gotta fight an assassin bug thingy or something [spoiler] can you say ""LSD"" ??? [/spoiler] and then after getting the head of a goat, a lion, and a snake (that shit ACTUALLY happens) you fight Napolean for the finale showdown and UH-OHHHHHHH!!!!!1!! TURNS OUT NAPOLEAN HAD ALL THE CHAOS EMERALDS AND BY SACRAFICING HIMSELF AND ON OTHER MOSTER, HE CAN SPECIAL SUMMON ANNACONDA IN ATTACK MODE! BUT He is easily killed by bullets. An eye for an eye amiright? *laugh bit* and then you get down to the docks and the crazy ex girlfriend is like ""sorry, but your princess is in another castle."" So she takes you to el Dorado which is actually doctor willey's lab. then she leaves again because. just because. So then the blonde guy is like ""I am a god and you must worship me"" but the locals say ""fuck you"" and then they start fighting but you win cause you came from spain and therefore you have guns and they dont. Then you find the princess and then you go dumptser diving and you fight like the most disgusting things ever and then you commence grand theft auto and steal truck and drive it into a building because you let the girl drive (dumbass) and then the princess is taken away like serioulsy put a leash on this chick! Then you fight a slug and JESUSS FUCKING CHRIST WHAT THE FUCK IS- OH MY GOD GET THAT THING THE FUCK AWAY FROM ME I- i- oh man I almost vomited. I'm skipping the slug fight. Then you fight Rambo but in this universe Rambo is actually a dick (hey, i think ive uncovered a central theme in this game). so then a helicopter shows up and its like that scene from call of duty when the helicoper shows up and its like *BANG BANG BANG BANG* AND *SHHHHHHOOWW BOOOOOOM BOOM BBBBBOOMOOJOAJOMOJM* and it gets shot down because all good things must come to and end (or cum to an end if you know what im saying *cricket chirping*). and now its time for the finale showdown with the pope and hE TURNS INTO A-a-ummmmm, what the fu- what is he supposed to be? well, whatever, he has a big eyeball and therefore by zelda rules you must shoot its eye. And your girlfriend is all like ""its dangorous to go alone, take this"" and gives you an RPG and you pick it up and aim it at the bad guy and say ""knock knock, whose there? you're ugly"" and you fire the misille and the bad guys dying the music gets all sad and the women starts singing ""in the arrrrrrmmmms of an angle, fly awwwwaaaaaayyyy!"" and then the crazy ex girlfriend pushes the self destruct button because thats how the road to El Derado ends right? and so the dude and saggy tits get on the boat and leave the island and use a jet ski to get back to America, or most likely to be eaten by sharks\n\noverall, I give this book a 9/10\nIts deffinantly in my top ten and maybe even top five games of all time.",Recommended

I would highly recommend this game to anyone who likes a good action third person shooter with a very small side of survival horror.  This game is great and hasan't aged much at all in the decade plus since its release.\n\nI will say though that there are some bugs in the game.  It did crash a few times, and sometimes when I would quit the game, it would not end properly and the screen would go completely black; not even bringing up task manager could bring back the screen.  I would then have to do a complete system reboot.  Not a huge, huge deal, but it is definitely something worth noting.\n\nAnyways, buy this game, and experience a masterpiece.",Recommended

"I have only just started gaming a few months ago. Resident Evil 4 on PC is the first game I played and completed. This classic game is a good introduction to gaming as you move through the normal to professional levels.  The controls are relatively simple to learn and get used to on a xbox 360 controller.  This remastered version does not have the greatest graphics by today's standards, but there is a good mixture of plot events, action and exploration for a beginner.  \n\nThe side mission Separate Ways (unlocked after you complete the game at least once) is a short but nice bonus.  The paramters by which you must complete the mission is different, since you play Ada's adventure alongside Leon's main storyline. The change in combat style, health and lack of weapon range/upgrade provides a different experience.  One of the highlights is the sequence within the warehouse, where you must survive against hoards of militia Ganados as well as machine gun turrets. \n\nAssignment Ada is another side mission that offers a faster-paced chapter, with no type-writers or the Merchant to help and dwindling suitcase space as you must drop supplies to fit in the Plagas samples.\n\nPlaying on the Professional mode can feel exhausting at times - the level design in increase in difficulty can at times rely too much on increasing the number of enimies.  In that kind of situation the timing becomes key to progressing beyond certain areas.  An example is the room with the lava pool and the wrecking ball.  I was stuck in that room for a good couple of hours because you need to get pass the room with enough ammos and health items left to continue until the next type-writer/save point.\n\nIn the Separate Ways mission, one can feel too flush with ammos, health items  and petas - I ended the game with a XL suitcase full of supplies.  \n\nFinally, the Mercenary side mission is not something I enjoyed.   Playing the character Leon shooting as well Ganados as possible with time limits and running around in a large area is devoid of what I like about RE4.\n\nAll in all, I spent 104 hours play time on it.  It has been worth every penny of the 11.99 GBP I paid for the game.",Recommended
"Bought this game out of curiosity for the series and the overwelming positivity this game has.This game might have been decent 20 years ago.The controls are absolute crap.Your dude moves like a freaking battle tank, as in very little and very poorly.So far the only terror i had was due to the fact that the controls are so bad that even in slow motion i still cant get the battle tank dude to turn or shoot or do what i want.I even bought a xbone controler to play this game and its still virtually uncontrollable.other than nostalgia dont waste your money on this, its not worth it.",Not Recommended

"Okay, re writing this review to sound a little more professional. First of all, the ""high res"" textures almost look no different from the original. And don't give the excuse that there are texture mods for this online that make it look better. That defeats the purpose of this. It should already have high res. The second big problem, the horribly streamlined controls. Both the gamepad and keyboard/mouse controls are terrible, especially the gamepad's. The turning is too stiff on the joysticks. The mouse aiming is too stiff too, and it gets too sensitive if you cut it up higher. This severely affects the mercenaries for me. It also feels like the difficulty has been intensified. I actually like the 2007 PC port better than this but windows backwards compatibility is a joke on 10 so it's either the console versions or this. Please, save your money. This is the worst version of Resident Evil 4 yet. Pure garbage of a port. Now I know you stupid PC master race and capcom fanboys are going to be very offended by this.

However, what made the Wii Edition so good was the vastly improved controls so the question must be asked - If Capcom are going to make a Port of the Wii edition then why in the Blue Hell did they not simulate the improved control system in a form that can be used on a PC Hmmm?  The mind boggles at this oversight.\n\nIt should also be mentioned that this game is further crippled by the high rate of Glitching and Crashing, indeed, since I purchased this I have had to uninstall and reload Five Times just to progress so be very aware of that before you buy.  My advice is to wait for another Halloween Sale.",Recommended

"A very fun and probably one of the greatest Resident Evil games that was ever developed with all things considered with the later games. The game was the first to change up the formula from the old camra angles that remained stationary, that many games afterwards would reproduce, thinking that was what made te series scarey, but often doing it really bad compared to Resident Evil.\n\nWith this one it changes to a 3rd person perspective with the camra following close behind so you don't realise an enemy is behind you until it's too late and the upgrades to the weapons can make some of the weakest weapons, the best in the entire game.\n\nThe story itself has some great cheese to it, which makes it a lot of fun with interesting antagonists to engage in and Leon Kennedy being quite a fun character too in the entire thing with his unsubtle way of hitting on women and making many quips against his enemies before he finally faces them.\n\nWhat's most fun is the unlockable weapons from completeing the game, completeing the additional game content such as Operation Ada and Seporate ways, both starring Ada Wong who you meet in the game and you play as her with her grapplying hook, replacing the need for a second character to help piggyback over areas.\n\nIt's a really fun game and when playing alone can get quite creepy with the new enemy who aren't zombies, but are possessed with little to no free will of their own.",Recommended

This game has the most replay value out of any game i have played because the gameplay is just so damn fun. I come back to this game whenever i dont have anything to play.

"The starting point in the history of games over the shoulder, plus the good memories of my childhood.",Recommended
"First of all, let me just start by saying this game is amazing and should never be forgotten since it was a vital part of the shaping of the seventh generation of console shooters. Many of the aspects this game introduced or perfected from previous use have become a staple of pretty much every third person shooter that came out after 2005. While Gears of War may have pushed other games to have these features, RE4 was the one who brought them into the survival horror action esq genre.\n\nSo I came into this game with mediocre expectations from hearing what others had to say about the modern Resident Evil games. They all said that 4 killed the series, and I though it killed it in a bad way. That's not the case. RE4 was the creative peak for the Resident Evil franchise. This game is the most self aware game I've ever played and is proud of it. I can see the game designers in an office saying to themselves how they want their main character to not react to anything, even when it's a F*CKING WALL OF FLESH BLOCKING YOUR ONE WAY OF ESCAPE! Anyway, the way this game killed the franchise was not a bad way. 4 is like the oddball of the Resident Evil franchise. It doesn't fit into the classic RE games, and it doesn't fit into the crappy modern ones. It found a balance between action and survival horror attempting to pease everyone. And it actually did! I was thoroughly impressed with the quality of this game. It appeals to fans of the series as well as newcomers. The story introduces new characters, and the old characters have new motives. The overarching storylines of some of those characters are mentioned, and are even major factors of the main story at points! \n\nThe game is a third person shoulder shooter with survival horror atmosphere. The game controls okay on PC, but the keyboard and mouse controls don't really do the ""limited movement"" charm of this game justice. It's kinda hard to be in a tense situation when you could just flick your wrist and blow somebody's head off. If you have the money, play this game with a controller. It's near perfection with a controller. Also, there is a heavy focus of limiting ammo in this game even though the game favors enemy confrontation rather than enemy avoidance. Of course, you could always charge into battle holding down fire, but that's just plane stupid. There are many, many ways to dispatch the enemies. You have melees and knives, so knock yourself out.\n\nThere are, however, some problems I had with the game.\n1. I thought the game was just a bit too easy even on the hardest difficulty\n2. There are only 3 difficulty settings\n3. There are few boss battles\n4. The game reuses a few of their fights with little to no changes\n5. Some of the characters are not fleshed out, no matter how self aware the game is\n\nOverall, RE4 is an amazing game. If you've never played it before, pick it up right now. After playing it, it became my favorite game of all time. Just be cautious if you are a hardcore shooter player. The tank controls and not being able to aim while moving are hard to get used to. \n\nI give Resident Evil 4 a solid 9.5/10",Recommended

"PLayed this game way back on Playstation and I can really recommend this one.\nIn case you didnt like RE5 or 6 or any others after, this one is actually very different. Great Story(maybe dont think too much about it though, they never make sense :D) and it feels like an actual horror shooter and keeps you on it for hours.\n\nI guess Graphics are of course a bit outdated and I cant really see much HD in it so far .Controls are a bit difficult and may feel weird in the beginning, but not too hard to get used to.\n\nIf you want a good horror game this one may be a good choice",Recommended

"CAPCOM should realistically have to face a class action lawsuit for having the absolute balls to call this ugly piece of piss ""Ultimate HD"". Not only is it a barely noticeable improvement over the original in terms of texture resolution, the higher resolution exposes some flaws that were ""covered up"" in the old original, like weird joint movements in Leon's body when holding some weapons.\n\nIF you can ignore this however, Resident Evil 4 is the absolute best game in the series, my favourite game and arguably one of the best games [i]ever[/i] made. The gameplay is incredibly tight and gets quite challenging at times due to the game's brilliant dynamic difficulty system, the game world is stunning and atmosperic through clever use of ambient noise and the great level design, the pacing of the game is top-fucking-tier (it even uses Quicktime Events correctly!), the cheap humor and flat characters in the B-movie storyline are unforgettable for their cheesy enjoyability and it has a ridiculous amount of content.\nOn top one large and one small campaign that are unlocked upon beating the ""official"" game, you also unlock the legendary Mercenaries mode, and then there's still a bunch of weapons and costumes to collect.\nYou're going to be busy playing this game to completion. And chances are you'll enjoy every second of it.\n100% recommend, to people who aren't afraid of ugly games. And with the re4hd project, even this limitation falls away.",Recommended
"Played this on Gamecube back in the day and it was good then.  However, this plays nothing like RE5, RE6, or any other modern RE game on PC.  You have to keyboard turn and can not strafe.  This was their first awkard transition from the old fixed point camera to 3rd person.  I love RE5+, but the controls were painful in this.  If you are used to old school FPS with a gamepad you'll fair better.\n\nGlad to see the graphics have been improved.",Not Recommended
"im enjoying the hell out of this game. ive played other resident evil games like 2 on the N64 and the newer ones that are... ehhhh. some people complain about the tank controls... it totally adds to the scare factor that this game is achieving. nothing is worse than hearing the agro of an enemy to slowly turn and see 5 zombies running at you with knives, to shoot their heads off and only have it get worse. get used to the controls just like what i had to and PLAY THIS GAME. the hype is real on this game. next time there is a sale, this better be the first item in your cart.",Recommended

"After more than ten years this game remains dear to me as I still have the pamplet i got from the DVD release of Ok-ish Resident Evil Apocalypse, All i had known were the films, little did I know i was about to stumble into one of the greatest horror franchises I would ever play.... RESIDENT EVIL!\n\nAfter seeing the pamplet and deducing that not only was there a Resident Evil game but that this was the 4th in the franchise, I knew i had to have this game and about one two years later i finally picked it up when it launched on the PS2 however at the time this game scared the ever loving shit out of me with gritty dead trees, grain filters, hell scape music, and chainsaw wielding maniacs that haunt me to this day.\n\nIt wouldnt be until 2012 when i came back to this game after growing a pair from Resi 5 and the Silent HIll series. What i found when i came back was a highly replayable campy action game. This game is only actually scary for the first fifteen-ish minutes after that you get to do things like inventory tetris, run from boulders, fight lake monsters, the predalien, giant statues, and a guy who reminds me of John Rambo. Its like an 80's action movie had kids with a Shamylan horror flick except theres no twist and it just gets weirder and weirder.\n\nThe gameplay mostly consist of finding health items, conserving ammo for different guns and upgrading overtime. Enemies become tougher and more relentless as the game goes on, from villagers wielding farm tools to militia soldiers tossing dynamite and wielding shields. There is a lot of QTE moments as well such as escaping from a ganados grasp to performing roundhouse kicks.\n\nIf none of that did it for you this game is highly replayable and has a shit ton of content. After you complete the main game you unlock the following:\n-Professional Mode: The Hardest difficulty which upon completion gives you the P.R.L. 412 laser canon.\n-Seperate Ways: An extra campaign featuring a series favorite character.\n-Assignment Ada: An additonal non-canon challenge mode featuring above character.\n-The Mercenaries: One of the first horde modes that sets you on a time limit and tells you to get high scores to unlock more characters for the mode.\n\nAbout the only bad things I can say about this game are it starts to show its age with slightly clunky controls, some fuzzy pre render videos that werent updated, and lastly the games legacy as it helped popularize QTE's and Third person shooters which only became more genaric as time went on.\n\nMy final verdict is a 9/10 for an almost perfect game thats a little rough around the edges.",Recommended
"RE:4 is a classic. It has been ported over many times to different platforms and for good reason. This port in particular is an excellent one, adding HD textures and aditional extras that didn't ship with the original GameCube on its initial launch. The game features great controller support, but I've found that a mouse and keyboard to be my new favorite way to play. \n\nIf you're new to the game, this is currently the best way to get into it. \n\nPROS: \nGripping story\nSolid mechanics\nSatisfying inventory system\nReplayability with different modes unlocked\nSolid ""level"" design\n\nCONS:\nShit menu options\nMenu navigation could use work with kb+mouse\n\nOverall I'd give the game 8/10. The game would of been a perfect 10, but I feel like the atmosphere lacks a little in this game. Something the RE franchise lost over time, but it doesn't disqualify this entry from being one of the best in the series.",Recommended

"If you haven't played Resident Evil 4 yet, you're missing out. This port used to be a bit glitchy, but I believe they've solved all of the major problems. The only real problem you might have with this game is the controls. It might feel awkward to get into the control scheme if you're used to most other shooters. The main thing is that you shouldn't be aiming with your mouse at all if you're not aiming your gun. The controls are tank controls through and through, but believe it or not that's exactly how the game is meant to be played. It might feel counterintuitive at first, but as soon as it clicks you'll be playing one of the classics. I played this on the GameCube when it first came out, and I played it on the Wii as well. I prefer mouse and keyboard controls, and when I bought the Semi-Auto Rifle in this port I felt like I was a god.",Recommended

Each new area has enemies changing weaknesses and strengths making you have to change your strategy and play style. while most games then and now just make enemies into bullet sponges, RE4 had you constantly adjusting your strategy to a new weakness or evolution of the main enemies you faced.\n\nIconic boss battles that are still memorable.\n\na Recommended classic and worthy of being in everyones library.\n\nThe ""HD"" in this release isn't Recommended HD but there are a group of modders making an actual HD mod that looks fantastic",Recommended

"Resident Evil 4 is one of my favorite games of all time.  This game blew my mind 11 years ago when I first played and it is to this day one of the best games I have ever played.  At the time the shooting mechanics, with the over the shoulder and with the laser sight, were revolutionary and although easier to use than the previous Resident Evil titles, still could create lots of tension.  This game was also one of the first games to ever use quick time events that would add so much cinematic elements to the game and would be used in many other games several years later.  This is probably one of the few perfect games I have every played.",Recommended

"I think anything I could say about Resident Evil 4 could be easily summed up by the fact that the Steam release is maybe the 5th time I've purchased it. It somehow still manages to hold up, even over RE5 for me. If somehow you haven't played RE4 yet then the Steam version is a pretty good one to buy I suppose, though be careful because it's kinda optimised a little poorly.",Recommended

"Easily one of the best games ever made. I remember being around 9 when I first head about this game 10 years ago. Had it on the gamecube after trading with a friend. Through the years I've had at least 30 playthoughs, each one as enjoyable as the last. Unlocking the infinite ammo tommy gun and rocketlauncher was always an amazing feeling. Now that I have it on pc I can go back and relive all of those amazing memories. You have to play this game.",Recommended
Fantastic <3,Recommended
"Great game, but not very realistic! ;-)\n\nComing at this game on a PC will be a shock. The controls are bad, and they're bad on purpose. This game's difficulty was balanced for consoles, and it remains bad on PC. Don't expect to be landing headshots and powering through levels like you're the marine from Doom.\n\nPretend that it's keyboard only. You don't steer with the mouse. It's hard to get used to at first - like if you started up a shooter and the Y-axis is inverted. Deep down, your brain still understands the mechanics, but it takes some time before it fully integrates into your playstyle.\n\nIf you can get past that, you're in for a treat.",Recommended

"I absolutly love this game. Even after YEARS of games with better graphics and more horror ideas, all we get is jump scares. This game does not gain its horror from jump scares. I mean, it does. but it also has a wonderful atmosphere, and a sense of loneliness. Spooky. Love it. And it's also a SURVIVAL horror. Manage you ammo carefully.

"what i liked:\n1. this game had an amazing story. as you progress the game you meet uexpected people, you start the game feeling lost and hopless in a town in spain, in the end though you are a triger happy basterd who has an incindiary rocket launcher which one hit kills the final boss.\n2.you had a verity of guns. you get about five pistols, 2 snipers, 3 shotguns, 3 revolvers i rocket , 1 submachine gun and 1 chicago typewriter\n3.the game was a Recommended horror game done right. it had very good atmosphere sounds, music and the bosses were intrsting too\n4.high replay value. for example mercinaries, hard mode, assigmant ada and seperate ways\n\nwhat i did not like:\n1. the combat feels rusty with its controlls and it takes a while to get used to.\n2.the graphics are meh for a HD remaster as all the developers did was improve framerate and made the graphics sharper and in HD, the textures on faces and bodies etc. are all the same.\n\nconclusion: if you played any of the other resident evil games or if you are into well written stories with intrigue, suspence and action tahn this is yor type of game, but if you are into games where you care about graphics and gameplay baove else thatn you may find it a hard time playing and enjoying this game\n",Recommended
"It was a new direction on the resident evil series and I thoroughly enjoyed it.\nThe setting and inhabitants of the game really don't make you feel welcome and keeps you on the edge.\nThe story isn't anything groundbreaking but the characters are fun even if they feel a bit cheesy.\nThe game understands it is kinda ridiculous and it embraces that feeling to make it fun at every turn.\nThe weapons feel great, even if the controls can sometimes feel restrictive.\nThere are a few quick time events but not enough to make you feel like there are too many of them.\nReplaying the game is also fun because you get access to new weapons that change your entire approach to the game.",Recommended

"Excellent game that starts off the ""Action"" change in genre for Resident Evil 4. \n\nTaking this game as what it is, and not a strict Resident Evil sequel is kind of paramount in enjoying it.

"Resident Evil 4 is a great game. There's a port for this game everywhere for a good reason. A great mix of action with survival horror. Heavily recommended if you are even the least bit curious.\n\nThe version at the time of this review i'm writing seems to have plenty of compatibility issues. For people with laptops here's how I fixed my game crashing: go to Services , and stop the service that says ""Touch Keyboard and Handwriting Panel Service"". Don't ask my what's the relation, all I know is that my game crashed every 15 minutes unless I stopped this service. You're welcome.",Recommended
Probably the best game I've ever played and boy howdy have I played a lot of games.\n\nUPDATE Still great to this day and will be forever more.,Recommended
"A solid port of one of the best games of all time.\n\nThere have been a bunch of ports of Resident Evil 4 over the years, with varying degrees of success. The original Windows port is one of the worst ports of a good game ever made, while the PS2 port was one of the best.\n\nThis port takes the best parts of all the other ports, adds a few features of its own and makes for a pretty definitive edition. There are still occaisionally some rough edges, but in general this is a solid port.\n\nIncluded features:\n\n[list]\n[*]Selectable framerate lock to either 60 or 30fps.\n[*]1920x1080 resolution\n[*]Upgraded textures for most models \n[*](finally!) decent mouse/keyboard support. While I prefer to play RE4 with a controller, it's now entirely possible to use WASD + mouse and have a good experience. Just remember: there's still aim drift, so don't think you'll be able to breeze through the game with your CS:GO skills.\n[*]All of the extra levels and modes, such as Assignment Ada, Seperate Ways, Mercenaries, etc.\n[*]Relatively low hardware requirements. Unless you have a potato GPU, you should be able to play this game at a solid framerate.\n[/list]\n\nSome animations (like reloading the bolt-action rifle) are 30fps even if you're running at 60fps. Some textures have not been upgraded. If details like that bug you, well, there you go.\n\nAs to the game itself, this is the Resident Evil that changed the direction of the series, for better and for worse. Instead of a slow-moving classic survival horror experience, this is more like tactical third-person combat. It has different difficulty levels, but also auto-adjusts enemy placement and item drops depending on how well/not well you're doing. It also has genuinely *tense* gameplay; not nessicarily suspenseful like in classic RE, but you're not going to be bored.\n\nBecause this is a single-player focused game, the issues with terrible partner AI in later RE games are pretty much non-existant here. Combat is the central mechanic, and it's polished to a mirror shine. The weapon upgrading system is excellent, and often leads to having to make tough choices about what weapons to focus on. This is tied with the awesome puzzle-like inventory system which makes the task of organizing the stuff you lug around almost like a mini-game.\n\nSpeaking of mini-games, the target-shooting minigame that shows up at various points in the game is also brilliant, with a goofy sense of humor that can provide relief from the opporessive mood of the rest of the game. It can also sharpen your aim, since it uses the exact same mechanics as the rest of the game. The excellent Mercenaries mode turns the combat into a purely arcade-style experience that is significantly challenging and addictive. The additional single-player side story missions are okay, but not essential to enjoying the game.\n\nThe story is B-movie, the art is excellent, the soundtrack adds a lot of tension, the voice acting is variable (but aeons ahead of classic Resident Evil).\n\nOther than that, I'll just say: to play this game at top level, don't forget to use the knife.",Recommended

"Ranking: 5/5\n\nThe fact that Resident Evil 4 finds itself on so many consoles after it's original release on the GameCube should give new buyers a hint of its quality. Resident Evil 4 not only defined the 3rd person shooter and changed the format of Resident Evil games from that point on, but continues to hold the test of time as a innovative, creative and fun experience. This is one of the few games I continue to replay over and over again, and I believe that a majority of people could find great enjoyment and not need to have played any previous games in the series.",Recommended

RE4 has the best balance between the outdated tank controls of the original trilogy and modern 3rd person shooter control conventions.

"My friends and I first played this game when I was 16, taking turns at deaths or level completion. From the first time we got our head chainsawed off until the last bombastic moments, this game had me entirely enthralled. This year, 2016, in between summer classes, I had the chance to play this game twice more as I attempted all achievements- once on standard difficulty and once on professional. A decade after my first time, this game is still astounding. \n\nWhat makes this game so great, so timeless? \n\nIt's made with love. \n\nUncharacteristic of a triple-A studio, this game wants you to have a good time and pulls out all the stops to ensure that your twenty or so hours per playthrough are the ride of your life. \n\nPacing? Sublime. There are segments where the game asks for all you have, pushes you to the limit because it, like a loving parent (or guardian) knows you can do it and that the cathartic juxtaposition of peace afterwards as you steadily upgrade your weapon of choice toward maximum power in preparation for the next mind-bending conflict is the sweetest of rewards. \n\nHumor? Excellent. This game knows that by mixing humor and lighthearted character interaction into the mix as contrast that the violence is that much more appalling (fun fact? The aforementioned chainsaw decapitation was the first time a videogame ever made me feel sick). Never truly willing to take itself too seriously, its only goal is to have a good time, all the time. \n\nDepth? 20,000 leagues. One playthrough introduces players to the systems and mechanics, but only through subsequent playthrough and exploration can all weapons and costumes (some of which even affect gameplay!)  be unlocked. The weapons are very carefully balanced, and with thought, any weapon makes for a viable solution.   \n\nGraphics? This game is over 10 years old, and it does show. However, the characters,  monsters, environments, and weapons are all carefully designed. Each reload animation is interesting and unique to watch. The monsters are grotesque, and the environments are beautifully detailed, with care paid to make all locations feel alive. \n\nI'd be even more obviously biased in this game's favor if I didn't mention the following unfortunate facts:\n\nAt first the controls felt slightly archaic, having seemingly been surpassed by the legions of games this game's influence spawned, but after tweaking things slightly in the options menu things clicked into place. I also have to grudgingly admit that there are a couple strange bugs at 60 fps that occasionally make quick time events too difficult,and sometimes those segments are best at the game's terrible 30 fps setting, but that's easily remedied in the options menu. \n\nDespite that, the game is perfect. Game of the year, decade, and century. \n\nTL;DR bring the bolt-action rifle with you on Professional mode.",Recommended

"Now this is a proper PC port! Not only that, it's an HD Remaster too so you can play it is sweet 60fps (or if you want that creepy look you can always turn it back to 30fps, your choice)\n\nUnlike the more modern RE titles like 5 and 6, this one still retains the horror elements of the older titles while still giving it a new take on their genre by adding in a bit of action to the mix.\n\nA lot of players may find a little later in the game that a certain mechanic will frustrate them to no end. That being securing the president's daughter. While I myself actually liked that mechanic that it gives me a sense of urgency to actually protect someone defenseless, I can understand why people would just attempt to leave her there to be abducted again since she can't do anything than just stand around and be scared.\n\nThe only other con I can think of is that the camera can take time getting used to since it's tank controls. Some enemies you'll encounter can be quite fast and sometimes you'll be overwhelmed by sheer numbers unless you have something that has a lot of spread.\n\nAll in all the game's not that bad.",Recommended

"This is one of the few games I've played through entirely more than 3 times. It just doesn't get old.\n\nResident Evil 4 is one of those games that established a new playstyle, that of the over-the-shoulder third person shooter, and countless games since have attempted to emulate it. You obtain a variety of firearms with which you can strategically eliminate mobs of parasitized villagers, cultists, soldiers, and monsters. Inventory management has never been more fulfilling than the expanding attache case. Try using the knife most often for a survivalist ammo-sparing challenge!\n\nIn traditional RE style, the story is chock full of cheesy developments, characters, and dialogue. Monsters abound, both experimental and accidental, with fluctuating levels of Recommended combat capability and body horror. The villains are over the top and delightful to watch. The heroes are playing out an action movie fantasy in a very charming way. The environment is gorgeous and spooky, from the rural Spanish countryside to an old imposing castle, to an island base with mazes of laboratory corridors and military encampments.\n\nAll in all, this game is a completely worthwhile experience that I have enjoyed time and again. In my opinion, RE4 transcended the series it inhabits to become one of the most classic standout gaming experiences in history.\n",Recommended
The game so good that Capcom would rather just re-release it for every platform than try to top it with any future titles.,Recommended
"re 4 was my first re game and when i heard it was getting a remastered and it was coming to pc i had to buy it, tbh it is a ok port but i didnt buy it for the graphics or the better shadwos etc etc i bought it because it is a good game and it is a must play for any re fan",Recommended
I like this game a bit too much.,Recommended
One of the best games ever,Recommended
"I have played this game on the Gamecube, Wii, and now for the PC. If there were a VR option, I would spend the $800 for the VR Headset as well. One of my favorite games from one of my favorite series. Leon is also bae.",Recommended
"One the best games I have ever played. Game still holds up to this day. At this point I think everyone knows what RE4 so I will not give a review on the actual game. If you have not played this one yet and were ever interested do yourself a favor and get it. Game is a masterpiece. Defintely the best modern, post tank controls, Resident Evil game by far.",Recommended
"This game stumps all others in the RE franchise for me its a perfect mix of inventory managment, glorious shooting mechanics, and imaginative bosses",Recommended
"There is a reason that RE4 has been remastered and rereleased as many times as it has. It's truly a masterpiece of a game that everyone deserves to play, no matter what gaming platforms they have access to. A lot of people speak fondly of RE4 because it was something of a trailblazer in the third-person shooter genre. It was one of the first of its kind, and that helped make it genuinely memorable when it first released. What's stunning is how well the game has aged despite the decades of refinements that have been made to its genre. I genuinely cannot sing enough praises for this tremendous action game. If you don't already own it, you should 100% buy it right now.",Recommended
The best game ever made in my opinion. Play it now.,Recommended

"[h1]The apex of the Resident Evil series.[/h1]\n\nAs a sequel to a franchise such as Resident Evil (Biohazard), trying to make a game that lives up the expectations is no small task to pursue, and yet, RE4 delivers, big time.\n\nWhen compared to previous titles, it is obvious that RE4 has suffered a massive revamp in the way you see and control the world that surrounds you and the characters that take place in it, previous titles revolved heavily around the use of fixed cameras, whereas the fourth title of the saga changes to a third person view camera, this was one of the boldest moves of the game, since, as it's been previously said, the old titles' use of fixed cameras was an essential part of the way Resident Evil told its story and immersed the player in it, now RE4 threw that out of the window, no more innevitable jumpscares and zombies coming straight at you when you had no much room for maneuravility, RE4 got rid of this, the new camera and aiming gave the player more freedom to move around and have more options to choose as to how to comfront the enemies, aiming is now also a very integral part of your survival in the game, you no longer simply press aim and shoot, you have more variables to consider now, how many enemies are coming at you? do you climb that ladder and retrieve to a higher location or do you stand your ground? do you use your knife and save some bullets in the process? That last question is specially important, as you will see throughout your journey in this weird spanish village, ammunition is no scarce by any means, as there's always a box, barrel or monster that replenishes you with more stuff every few meters along the way, but if you are not careful with how you spend your bullets, you will soon see yourself standing surrounded by a mob armed with torches and pitchforks without much to defend you but a couple of gun magazines and a throwable chicken egg!\n\nThe story of RE4 is quite ridiculous if you actually stop and think about it for a second, you are Leon S. Kennedy, former Racoon City survivor and police officer, tasked with rescuing the daughter of the president of the United States, all by yourself, from a group of religious cultists ranging from simple peasants [spoiler]to fulll-on zombie wolverines, well, not quite, as you will be explained not so later in the game, these are no common zombies as the ones you were already familiar with, these ones are known as ""Las Plagas"" which works more like a parasitic hive under the control of the cult leader, Osmund Saddler,[/spoiler] that appear to have a bit more of grey matter up in there, and let's not even get started with some of the bosses in here, that's just in another level of ridiculousness. But in the end, it doesn't matter, because the game doesn't take itself very seriously, so, why would you? \n\nCovered almost fully with a long black trench coat, is the merchant, with emblematic phrases such as ""Got a selection of good things on sale, stranger!"" and ""Stranger, stranger... now that's a weapon"", one of the most mysterious characters in the game, who functions as a shop for the player, where you can sell, buy and upgrade your weapons and stuff you find along the way. The various merchant stands that you'll find all over the place are always a nice and useful spot to get a break and a touch of humour.\n\nAll in all, a great game that stands strong to this day, and with good reason, it's filled with well-developed, charismatic characters that actually feel alive, as well as outstanding level design. And, while it may have taken away some of the survival horror aspects of the original titles, it has given us so much more in its place, an amazing world with a gameplay so fluid you'll feel like you float your way to the end, and most importantly, never losing its soul in the process, unlike what can be said about numbers 5 & 6 of the series, but hopefully RE7 goes back to the right path.\n\nIf you somehow, after all these years haven't played this masterpiece in any of the numerous versions it's had in various console generations and on PC, please make yourself a favor and buy this (also, free your schedule for the next couple of days),it will be money well spent.\n\nFinal note: there's an unofficial project from a couple of guys that has taken it upon themselves to retexture the whole game using original real world sources, it currently isn't finished but you can already download the files corresponding to the village part of the game, if you do mind about graphics, this provides quite a significant improvement, even for this ""HD"" version, which it is fully compatible with. If you are interested in this, you can easily google for it: re4hd.",Recommended

"TLDR: RE4 is a good action game, an action game so good that I would say that it is worth your time and money even if it isn't currently on sale.\n\nResident Evil 4 can only really be described as a classic.\n\nIts gameplay has stood the test of time and is still as fun as it was when the game first released in 2005(!).\n\nWhile some might describe the controls as ""clunky"", I like to think of them as ""purposeful"". They are designed to add tension and to force the player to form a strategy when engaging the game’s enemies. You can either shoot or move, but you can't do both. This means you must prioritise which enemies you will kill first in order to survive. This makes the game fun as you are often pitted against large numbers of enemies and the combination of evading their attacks and counter-attacking is often intense and rewarding.\n\nSomething that I have always loved about this game is that the gun upgrade system gives RE4 an almost RPG feel to it. As you progress through the story you are able to upgrade your favourite weapons and unlock new ones, when you complete the game you have the option of playing a new game plus mode where you keep your gear and have the opportunity to further improve your character. When you consider all the bonus weapons and skins you can unlock through completing the main game and the bonus modes this actually adds a considerable amount of gameplay to those who enjoy these kinds of features.\n\nSpeaking of the bonus modes and weapons... The Mercenaries is an absolute blast to play, and if you are like me, you will find yourself obsessively trying to get five stars on all the levels with all the characters to unlock the hand cannon for the campaign. The Ada Wong missions are also interesting and add more campaign-like missions for you to play through too. The bonus skins and weapons also add a bit more fun to the game, where you are actively trying to gain enough money to upgrade them to the point where they are just OP (like seriously OP, to the point where you can take down these giant enemies with like 2-3 shots of your hand cannon).\n\nThe story is also good and I find Leon to be an interesting character. It definitely doesn't take itself seriously (which is a good thing) and is quite comedic in its approach to unfolding the narrative. Everything about the story is over-the-top and kind of random, the characters are a mish-mash of odd stereotypes and their one liners are often cringy but often enjoyable because of that. The merchant alone is all of these things rolled into one extremely strange yet likeable character.\n\nAs for the performance of the game/the quality of the port, I actually think that it is top notch. I haven't run into any issues on my gaming pc and it always runs at a buttery smooth 60 fps on that. Even on my old shitbox of a laptop, if I turn down the settings it too gets 50-60fps consistently. \n\nI play exclusively with a keyboard and a mouse, because I find using a controller too unresponsive and not as accurate when you need precision shots to do well in the mercenaries and on higher difficulties (please, just turn up your mouse sensitivity - it will improve your experience exponentially). But many people swear by using a controller for the game. At the very least, rest easy in the fact that both seem to work well for people of both camps. \n\nI would honestly say that this game is worth the $20 it asks for normally, so if the game is on sale and you haven't played it before do yourself a favour and grab it. You won't be disappointed.\n\n\n\n",Recommended

"Besides the original, Resident Evil 4 is my favorite entry in the series. It signaled a change from the by-then tired original format to a style of game which finally seemed to push the action underpinnings the series had always wanted to utilize (fairly evident from the first game, but completely obvious by the second). I know a lot of people have bemoaned the turn away from the survival horror play of the earlier games, but for my part I felt like the games had a bit of ""survival"" in terms of resource management, but very little ""horror"" beyond the setting and monsters (although I give RE1 points for the excellent atmospheric music pre-director's cut). Anyhow I digress, the majority of the series are pretty enjoyable in general, and I suggest anyone who hasn't already played them give them a go.",Recommended

Amazing effects and interesting characters.\n\n\n10/10\n\nWould FOR SURE RECOMMEND PLAYING",Recommended
"The phrase ""it's a good game, just not a good ___ game"" fits perfectly here. RE4 is mostly a campy action game with hints of horror here and there, but that doesn't mean it isn't great. The gameplay is solid and the devs knew exactly what makes a story about an American hero who takes on an army of foreigners to save the president's daughter charming and hilarious in its absurdity. The gameplay is fun, the campaign is excellently paced and the extras like Mercenaries can be addictive.",Recommended

It stands the test of time really well, and it's great fun to just pick up and play. Mowing down enemies with the Chicago Typewriter has got to be one of the best feelings in gaming.",Recommended
"It's fame preceeds it, its a very engaging action game with a side of horror, or at least jumpscares.\n\nThe story is very engaging, I always found myself playing overtime just to see what happens next, and even though it has many cliché moments, it manages to add an original spin to it, and it isn't afraid of making a bad joke in the middle of a disaster; it's like the characters where actors of a movie, and from time to time they just took a break from their roles.\n\nThe gameplay is sturdy and heavy, meant for you to walk carefully in case there's an ambush ahead (and there will be many), even shooting is heavy to control and will demand skill from you more than just a big weapon most times. There's quick time events all over the place, and even when sometimes they feel unfairly quick, they reflect the context of the characters requiring to think fast while under pressure.\n\nThe environment is wonderful, it builds up with all horror game details to get the spooky atmosphere that will tense you up at times, and even when left in complete silence, it still transmits anxiety for the player of what comes ahead.\n\nMost fans of light horror and/or action will recommend this game, and it's not a frequent top game of all time for no reason... despite of what Capcom has made with the franchise over the years",Recommended

"Resident Evil 4 on Steam is every bit as good as it was when it launched for the GameCube over a decade a go. Even though many 3rd-person shooters have come and evolved the things that Resident Evil 4 did, I still feel like few did it as well. Maybe they made it better for action games, but Shinji Mikami's masterpiece is still perfect in every way for the game crafted around it.\n\nGameplay aside, this version brings with it some HD textures, some of which aren't as polished as you would expect, but the game definitely carries that ""It looks just like when I first played it!"" set of rose-tinted lenses. And on even a moderately powerful computer, it will run even smoother.\n\nResident Evil, as a series, was never really known for being incredibly well written, or acted, and the older games generally didn't look great. But Resident Evil 4 changed (almost) all of that. Even though the plot is clearly bonkers, it still carries just a little bit of that plausibility that keeps you invested in any kind of supernatural horror experience. You don't find yourself questioning the horde of mindless slaves to a parasite. Even the intense action sequences don't feel out of place for the world that was built around Leon Kennedy's European adventure. No matter how bombastic it is when you step away to think about it, everything in Resident Evil 4 works. The dialogue comes off as a bit stilted and ham-fisted in some places, but it feels more like a purposeful move to make these characters unique as possible, rather than to just fill in moments of dialog with the first sentence that comes to your head.\n\nThe sound design remains in tact, and if you can play with headphones, it will give you a better experience. Not only will it help to immerse you with little things like the sound of a torch smoldering beside you, it'll give you a tactical advantage as you can here where your enemies surround you.\n\nTo this day, almost no game has given me quite the thrills of Resident Evil 4. I still rate the opening hour of that game, up through ""The Village"" sequence, as one of the best set pieces in a video game.\n\nBut look, I could talk to you forever about how much I think Resident Evil deserves your attention, even this long after the fact. If the price is right, and even when it's not sale it usually is, you owe it to yourself to give this game a shot. (Note: If you can find a copy of the Wii Edition, prepare to enjoy all the same content, slightly lower res, but with a great 3rd person shooter control for the Wii-mote that will have you questioning why nobody did something with that for new games.)",Recommended

"*TRIGGER WARNING: Unfavourable review; may require safe space and colouring books. Gender pronouns may be heteronormative. Thesaurus required.*\n\nTLDR- This game is a crappy console port with unplayable controls.\n\nI bought this on sale as part of the RE4/5/6 package.\n\nI got about as far as the first save point before I got sick of playing this...the game could be described as an intoxication simulator, and it gave me a realistic idea of what life would be like if I had walrus flippers for arms and my feet were put on backwards.\n\nThe third person perspective is way too close fot the narrow FOV, it makes the game feel like you are following the main character around with your hands stuffed down the back of his pants while wearing a goldfish bowl on your head.\n\nThe character movement is sluggish and clumsy, it is like the character is heavily sedated and lacks peripheral vision and depth perception. If this was done on purpose to make the game more challenging, it may have worked, but not in a way that makes for an enjoyable game. Just walking down a curved path is a dreadful chore that makes churning butter seem like fun.\n\nI'm not the world's ultimate gaming badass, but I could usually take on a group of 8 or 9 slow moving unarmed European villagers if I had an automatic handgun and a frag grenade without the urge to ragequit, sell my computer and join a monastery.\n\nThe reduction in graphics quality and poor optimization makes the game seem older than it is. I think the original Half Life game had better rendering and visual appeal than this one. Despite the potato quality graphics, and the fact that I run a newer high end gaming rig, this squeezes out a pitiful 24 frames per second. I might as well have built a time machine and travelled back to 1996. At least then it would still be appropriate for me to hit on high school girls and not have the cops called on me EVERY SINGLE TIME.\n\nAiming at targets? LMAO...good luck. I tried adjusting the sensitivity on the controller to make this easier, but it is still like trying to kill a mosquito with a wet bag of flour. They threw in an aiming laser to try to make this tolerable, but it doesn't help. It would be better if they just used an aimbot...even slow moving targets take 5-8 seconds to get a fix on. Considering the fact that it takes about 17 or 18 headshots to kill the most basic enemies, this game could easily make the Dalai Lama shout abusive profanity at his grandmother.\n\nOverall this game did a good job of illustrating the considerable difference between console games and pc games, and why the two don't mix. The only way to port a console game IMO is to re-do the whole thing from the ground up to work properly on PC. It can be done, and it has been before, but I get the impression that the devs just wanted to squeeze a few more bucks out of the franchise...the PC gamer got the sloppy seconds here, and boy, they sure are sloppy. \n\nSteam was good enough to refund my purchase with no hassle, so kudos to them for resolving the matter. Let's all give Steam a big hug for being a good sport and giving me back my precious hard earned money. If you knew how many orphanages I had to rob to earn that money, you would understand my strong feelings.\n\nThis would be a perfect gift for someone who is responsible for the death of one of your loved ones, or perhaps Gitmo detainees could be forced to play it as a less humane alternative to waterboarding.",Not Recommended

I highly recommend this game to other people.\n",Recommended
"I've heard great things about this game, and I'd like to tell you enjoyed it. I'd like to, but I can't because this PC port just doesn't bleeding run. Yes, this ""not recommended"" is because of the port job, not the game itself. \n\nWhenever I tried to quit the game, my entire computer would get stuck on a black screen that requires a hard reboot to fix. Oh, but this can be fixed...if you run the game in Windowed mode. Some people suggested the Borderless Fullscreen program, but that doesn't work properly either. I shouldn't have to play my games in Windowed mode to ensure that they don't crash my entire computer!\n\nRandom slowdowns are also a huge issue. If there's more than three enemies on the screen, your game can go so slow it makes bullet time in Max Payne look fast. These seem intermittent and random from my experience, but they are incredibly distracting nonetheless. Really ruins the atmosphere this game was going for. Some people claim you can remove this by opening the map, but it did not work for me.\n\nThe last nail in the coffin for me was the QTEs. I already think QTEs are an abomination and should be destroyed, but this PC port has the balls to make them nigh-impossible if you play at 60 FPS! Whichever boneheaded engineer at Capcom that decided that QTE speed should be tied to the framerate can go burn in the same hell as the person who decided weapon deterioration in vanilla Dark Souls 2 should be tied to framerate (albeit more indirectly in that case). Sure, I could play this at 30 FPS, but when you combine the narrow (And not adjustable!) FOV with a lower framerate, I get motion sickness. \n\nI didn't even get to really play this game because how distracting these problems were. So I got a refund. If you want to play RE4, just get it on a console and stay away from this unstable PC port.

"Whoever was behind the development of this game is lazy af. Leon's campaign cutscene were all rendered in real time while Ada's campaign were all prerendered and the quality is so bad, I can't forgive by the fact that this game is ULTIMATE HD EDITION. This game is also poorly ported. BUT I still recommend this game for those who is a RE4 fans though.",Recommended

"I first owned Resident Evil 4 when it launched on the Nintendo Gamecube. \nI beat it, it was fun. A lovely addition and a great reinventing of the Survival Horror genre. \nI then bought the PS2 version, which while lacking in quality cutscenes wise - did feature additional content. Which I enjoyed.\nI have bought Resident Evil 4 more than I have bought any other game. It's clean controls, great atmosphere, and solid difficulty curve provide a timeless gaming experience that I would recommend to anyone. \n\nI have never written a review for the game. And I figured tonight is the night. Because tonight I'm hanging up my Red 9. And uninstalling RE4. ""How is that a good review?"" Well let me tell you. \n\nGraphics wise, RE4 has aged. It's upgrades make it a lot better but the graphics overall aren't why you should be playing this game. Still, the Ganado and Creature designs are great, and the backgrounds and environments are varied, atmospheric and full of life (Ironically enough). \n\nThe sound is top notch, the minimalstic ambient score dynamically pianos and crescendos with the dreadful coming hordes of the wicked. Mumblings and ramblings of Ganados and Cultists break against your ears melding with the crisp and unnerving steps and drags and shuffles. The voice acting. Well. It's one of the better in the series, we'll just leave it at that. Some great one liners and jokes though. \n\nGame play? It's great. A variety of weapons and tools lie at your disposal and you'll be hard pressed to run out of ideas for blowing enemies up or popping noggin's with. Of course everyone has their preferences - but with the wonderful upgrade system each playthrough can bring a whole new experience weapon wise. Don't want to go with the Red 9 again this cycle? Okay. Try the Blacktail! Or even a fully upgraded Normal Handgun. (It's fun with a headshot multiplier! Trust me!) A couple of different magnums to choose from. And shotguns for that matter. In addition - the three grenade types offer excellent utility against your foes. \n\nReplay value is fantastic, in addition to multiple playthroughs with New Game + allowing for a fully maxed out perfected character (HP max, all weapons max, etc.)  there are some wonderful game modes that are available either from the start of the game, or after completion! Want to go through a full campaign with Ada Wong? Of course you do. Or perhaps a quick ""One shot"" mission? That's there too. \n\nAnd of course we can't NOT talk about ""The Mercenaries"". This game invented the mode in this series and it was a doozy. Multiple characters able to be used over multiple stages to achieve the high score - killing enemies and collecting bonuses to increase time. And of course, racking up huge combos for points and learning how to manage your bonuses and collectibles just right. The reward of course, being the most powerful handgun in the game. \n\nI have been playing RE4 since launch. That's over 10 years. And it took all of those years for me to exhaust my enjoyment of this game. It's timeless, it's damn near perfect, and you should absolutely pick it up if you haven't had the chance to play it before. \n\nOr if you have, and you're like me. Maybe you want to travel down that dusty European road, just one last time - and ask a local for directions. \n\nAfter all, what could go wrong?",Recommended

Finally played RE4 for the first time more than a decade after its original release and it proved to be the classic that my friends had promised me it was. Here's why I recommend it: \n- Controls feel a little clunky which slows the pace and increases the challenge level a little. \n- The camera view is a little restricted but this serves to make the atmosphere even more tense as you never know what's around the next corner. \n- The puzzles ramp up ever so slightly as you progress but never get overly difficult or frustrating.\n- Occasional boss battles shake things up a bit but they never feel impossible or unfair.\n- Finally there's the dialog which hits the sweet spot of so bad it's good. It's so cringe inducing and terrible at first you'll think it was written by a teenager/badly localized. But if you go with the flow and start to appreciate the ridiculous characters and terrible one liners its a totally diff experience. More games should embrace just being kinda dumb!,Recommended
Shinji Mikami's  greatest masterpiece. \nThe best 3rd shooter of all time and nothing will ever come close to RE4.,Recommended
"[h1]A classic that still holds up [/h1]\n\nVery unique from the first installment. Instead of a mansion you have Spanish village/countryside, a castle, and an island. Instead of rationing a handful of items you can carry almost everything (after playing a bit of inventory tetris). Key items don't take up inventory space, finally. \n\nThere's about ten times the number of zombies--and they all gotta die. They're so eager to get shot in the head the game started engaging full-on Call of duty mode towards the end.\n\nA ton of effort was put into develping unique, memorable bosses. Both the fights themseleves and the personalities stand in stark contrast to what little I remember from the first game's characters and lines (other than Jill Sandwich). \n\nTank controls were a huge turnoff but the enemies are sluggish enough for the player to work around it. \n\nEvery time a cool cutscene came up I mashed f12 to capture it, only for an annoying QTE to appear. Luckily QTEs never caught on with other games in the 90-00s.  Oh wait",Recommended

"My favorite survival horror series, and my 2nd favorite in the series. (RE 1 takes the cake IMO) Anyway, this won GOTY in 2005 with good reason. Never played the original  but I really enjoyed the remastered verison. This inspired another really good game I reviewed (The Evil Within) with its camera angles, gameplay, and customization. The camera angles were switched up from the first 3 REs from the suspenseful jump scare angles, to basically knowing what will always be ahead of you. Don't let that fool you though. You will still be challenged. Just like TEW You will have to rely on your wits in some instances, and your weapons in others. The customization for weapons is pretty cool as well. A fully upgraded shotgun can do some serious damage to a group of enemies. and a fully upgraded handgun can pull off head shots like it's nothing. That can be very helpful, especially later on in the game. If you like survival horror games that really test your wit, I highly recommend this for you.",Recommended
"Resident evil 4 was undoubtedly a massive influence on the 3rd person shooter genre, even though the game itself is a hybrid survival horror/3rd person shooter.\nIf you are looking for more survival horror and not a shooter, then this might not be for you. \nAs far as survival horror games go, with shooter mechanics, this is at the top even after all these years.\n\nThe controls are old and very stiff if you compare it to modern games, so you have to be able to look past that and get used to it.

For some reason after playing in full screen and exiting the game from the main menu the computer goes completely blank, no return to desktop, no close....just ends. I had to restart my computer recovering from a system crash because of the game failing to shut down properly. You also cannot use the Windows button to go to your desktop or use CTRL + ALT + Delete to end the software from playing.\n\nThe game its self runs perfectly fine though, a nice smooth frame rate with tight controls HD to boot. Ashley's Panties out of 10. #""YouPervert""\n\nMy advice? Stick to the console versions if you don't want to risk running in to this annoying glitch, it won't crash on you, although I can safely say this glitch does not happen to everybody, I run a dual screen set up so that might have something to do with it? The game is still very much playable.....it is just you can never leave.\n",Not Recommended
"Resident Evil 4 is by far my favorite Resident Evil Game. The game stars Leon (first introduced in Resident Evil 2) as he searches for the President's daugther Ashley. He finds the both of them injected with a parasite called ""Las Plagas"" by a man named Sadler and must escape while searching for a cure and a way to stop Sadler. The game moves away from the T-Virus and focuses on this new threat. The game is an over the shoulder Third Person Shooter game unlike other RE titles, and brings a bit more action to the table. Unlike future installments however, RE4 doesn't ditch puzzles entirely and there are still a few great ones. While Leon has access to more weapons and ammo then other games, Enemies are a bit more tricky. Some will try to dodge his attacks, while others will sprout a Las Plagas upon defeat that takes over their body (Not unlike the Anime/ Manga Parasyte). The game has quite the few tense moments (like the one hit Kill Chainsaw Weilders) but is not too difficult. My one major complaint is the lack of Subtitles when playing with the Language set to English. Other than that, RE4 is an awesome RE game that stands at a comprimise between the older titles, and the action based Resident Evil 5 and 6",Recommended
"I never played RE4 on Gamecube, I started off with the Playstation 2 version but ever since I played this for the first time I've been hooked. I was going to purchase this on console (achievement hunter) but since go figure it was cheaper on PC I went with this version instead and I will tell you it does not disappoint! The 60 frames is a huge plus, being able to play at a full 1080p scale, my computer can barely handle 4k at 30 fps but it looks good on higher resolutions as well of course. Be sure to keep motion blur off in this game, makes the picture in this game very ugly. I'm about halfway through the game on my first playthrough right now and the game is just as good as the first time I had experienced it.

"I can tenatively recommend this because out of the ""TPS trilogy"" of Resident Evil games, this is the only one that's halfway decent. The story is gibberish that has nothing to do with anything, and the gameplay does little to nothing to build on the strengths or help the weaknesses of its predecessors; it opts to basically ignore them, instead. By all reasonable accounts, this game, Zero, and the Nintendo exclusivity deal REmake was shackled to are to blame for the death of the old series.\n\nBut for what it is, it ain't bad.\n\nThe atmosphere's really good for the first third or so, the combat is fun, and the inventory system is one of the best in the franchise. The middle and especially the last third are really weak compared to the village, but on the off-chance you don't already own this game, I'd say grab it. It's one of those seminal games ""everyone should play"" anyway, and a fine shooter.\n\nThat said, while the port's a massive improvement over the Ubisoft effort from 2007, it's still pretty bad. The ""HD"" textures are nothing short of pathetic, especially compared to what a passion project by a pair of fans has produced so far. The 60 FPS option affects the way repeated button presses are polled, which makes button-mashing QTEs next to impossible, and for some godforsaken reason, there are still no dedicated volume sliders for SFX and BGM. This is a feature REmake had on Gamecube in 2002. Absolutely disgusting.",Recommended

Later the villagers also use crossbows, dynamite sticks, RPGs, chainguns and electric batons. The USA doesn't care. You don't care either - just kill everyone. After genociding like 700 people you decide to request for backup, but the radio signal is being jammed. At some point America decides that they should probably check on the guy and the kidnapped president's daughter (I mean just in case, not a big deal tho), so they send *one guy* with a heli. The heli gets immediatelly shot down by the terrorist RPG wielding villagers.\n\nBy the end of the game you will have killed over a thousand infected people and saved the president's daughter pretty much single-handedly, after being mocked by the main antagonist that ""americans saving the day"" only happens in hollywood.\n\nI don't even, Capcom.",Recommended

This game won a ton of awards 11 years ago, and it's usually on top games of all time lists, no matter what the nostalgic RE fans who think static camera angles and tank controls are better. Don't get me wrong, I liked RE2 and RECVX, but fucks sakes, this is way better. I grew up with this and the RE Remaster, but this game has so much replay value that I poured hours into it on the gamecube trying to get the handcannon and things like that. \n\nThis game is the gold standard for resident evil that capcom was really never able to reach again, and that's why they're changing the series yet again with REVII. It was the last RE game directed by Shinji Mikami, and boy does it show. RE4 isn't the highest selling in the series, but it was so good that capcom broke their agreement with Nintendo for it to be an exclusive on the gamecube after only 9 months.Compare that to something like Dead Rising, that took 10 YEARS to be ported to other consoles. If you look at the box art for the original RE4, it actually says it's an exclusive for the gamecube. \n\nAccording to metacritic, it's the 24th best game of all time, right behind Half Life.

Enjoyable. I don't feel like I wasted my money buying it.\nPersonally I prefer REmake though and I would recommend you buy that one instead if you're choosing between the two.

The lab level was really spooky though because the normal guns didn't work against the Regenerators (type of zombie that grows body parts back).\nP.S. if you get stuck at the quick time event in the mine level you need to go to the main menu then go to options and change the FPS from 60 to 30.

"Resident Evil 4 is a masterpiece that, arguably, has not been matched in the 11 years since release. Resident Evil 4 is a ridiculously progressive game in the sense that everything about it still holds up. The controls may be awkward for the modern gamer (myself included), but it's the design that excels. The tight camera and stationary aiming add stress to the experience. Enemies come from all sides, requiring a frantic tactical use of aiming, firing, and running to a new point. Though the scares of the series are over as of RE4, it's that tension of being outnumbered, of running low on precious shotgun shells, and having to run for the level exit that renders those shambling, pixel-y zombies of old obsolete. A particularly good example of this is the infamous water level, requiring you to protect Ashley while surviving an onslaught of shield-bearing enemies and snipers while (possibly) having few supplies. The audio design in this scene is excellent with the pulsing sound of a heartbeat, whispers, and a moody soundtrack.\n\nThe dialogue and story are corny in the best way possible. Leon's defiant ""No way, Bro!"" and reference to the villagers' high priest as 'The Big Cheese' lend to the feeling of a somewhat campy B-movie. There are no Oscar-worthy performances here, but it's all about the entertainment value, which it has in spades.\n\nI never played RE4 when it was the latest, greatest thing. Or even when it came to every system known to man post-Gamecube generation. I played it first 10 years after and still found it to be as excellent as it was to gamers in 2005. The game redefined not only third-person shooters, but video games as a medium. RE4 is a top 10 game for me, hands down.",Recommended

Now that I've finally gone through the game again, I can make a real review and I still recommend this a fuck ton, now even more. While the mouse and keyboard controls are a bit weird for me, I'm someone who played this on a Gamecube, PS2, PS3, and a bloody Wii remote so I'm just used to controllers after a decade of capcam re-re-re-releasing this game. Besides that, and the fact that the cutscenes for Ada's campaign are not at 1080p for some odd reason (everything else in the game, including the cutscenes for Leons campaign, are in 1080p60fps like usual) there isn't really anything to compl-\n\n""LEEEEEEEEEEEEEEOOOOOOON!!! HAAAAAAALLLLPPPP!!!""\nSorry, had to throw that in there, because Ashley is so damn annoying. But yeah, besides those points, I love this game. It is once again my favorite Resident Evil game, and one of my favorite games ever made, with a very well done port. I had no issues while playing this game, which is odd because on some other reviews people with PC rigs $1000-$2000 more expensive than mine have problems. My guess is those people are having issues on their own end, not with the game itself, because this game runs fine for me on both my AMD and my Intel+Nvidia computers with no problem. \n\nSo the game itself - you're the best character Capcom ever created, Leon S. Kennedy, and you've been sent to find the Presidents Daughter, all by yourself, as your very first assignment. She's been kidnapped by a cult that has awakened the ""Las Plagas"", a much different virus than the one in Resident Evil 1-3, where instead of being zombies they're monsters, being controlled by the main enemy, Lord Saddler. He aims to take over the entire world with this power, and seeks to do it by using the Presidents daughter to slowly take over and influence him, eventually controlling the entire government and from there the rest of the world. If you're a player of the older Resident Evil games, there's also...a few other characters for you to see that you'll love to see in this game. Since this has been out over a decade though, I will go ahead and say it's Ada Wong, Wesker although only through a few calls in Ada's story, and Krauser, who has become an enemy. The enemies, the levels, the boss fights AND designs, they're all perfect, especially the horrific ones that game me nightmares as a child, and the worst one for me have always been the Regenerators, which regenerate the damage you keep trying to cause them and have the most disgusting faces ever made while the try to eat you. Their breathing, and the OST made just for them, don't help. \n\nYou don't need to play the other Resident Evils to enjoy this one, as it gives you a brief explantion of Leons earlier events in Resident Evil 2. You can jump into this ready to be scared, probably not as bad as I was my first time playing since I was in 3rd or 4th grade, and ready to have a great experience. Sure the controls are tanky, but when this first released back in 2005 on the Gamecube that was the best we got, and we're all lucky that this game was ever made, because originally this was apparently going to be a Devil May Cry game. Yeah, not sure how that would have worked out, but Capcom started realizing it during development and changed it to be a continuation of the Resident Evil series so I guess they didn't know how that would have worked out either. \n\nI'd give this game 5/5 blunts, with an extra pipe loaded just for the nostalgia.",Recommended

"[b]Away with the irrational fan-love. Bring the real love which is more productive even if they don't listen.[/b] When Resident Evil had a real name, the fourth installment made it clear to gaming that survival can only be made with a good map, some life organizer inventory, ultra-violence and tension leaving you scared sh*tless and a interesting plot to back it all up. On PS2 glory days, graphics were already good but with those HI-Res textures, RE4 just got some rightful restorative treatment. It isn't a revival or something, the zombies were only sent to some nice relaxing spa. They still angry though, the feeling to have many half-smart zombies (which is scarier than the full ret@rded ones) coming so slowly close to you, the darkness all around... it all still leaves a heavily armed ex-cop feeling like a girlie about to get r@ped in the woods - its all stills there. It's still hard, it still mature. Stills ultra-violent.\n\nFor my incredible surprise, it is still scary enough too. The plot was simple at first, but complex through it and full of interesting turning-points like every Biohazard before that. Never played it? Don't think twice. [b]You will have some problems with the joystick on the gameplay, but they implemented some variations on the options. You just need to explore that until you feel confortable with it and start tweaking from there.[/b] \n\n[b]This is the last great Resident Evil and I used to be a fan.[/b] But if Capcom now thinks that I'm going to love anything thrown at my face just because it bares ""Resident"" on its title, they must think I'm a b*tch and I'm not.

Does anybody know how to contact steams customer service. I have tried playing this on 2 computers both my recently owned laptop and my new current pc.

I'm not looking for a refund or anything but I would at least like some sort of solution. I just want to play the game!! :( lol,Not Recommended
"Resident Evil 4 may have celebrated its 11th birthday, but it doesn't feel a day old. Having never really played RE4 before (or any Resident Evil, for that matter), I set out to play what many consider to be a best survival horror/3rd person shooter ever. \n\nThey were correct.\n\nThe gunplay is tight and visceral. Giving you a tight camera that narrows your vision and can only be flipped quickly enough with a quick key press while also forcing yourself to stand still when taking shots creates a large amount of anxiety and fear as you enter gunplay, yet the entire game is designed around these facts, which means you rarely feel cheated or bullshitted. \n\nThe atmosphere is incredible. After a few cutscenes to set the mood, you find yourself alone in a Spanish village filled with large amounts of ""zombies"" seeking your death at once. The pure tension found within seconds is admirable, but it manages to carry that tension and atmosphere for quite a large portion of the game before hitting the full action stride. To tell you the truth, I've never played a Recommended horror game before, and found myself having to save and quit numerous times in short intervals in the beginning,\n\nThe survival is real. You'll find yourself counting your shots and making every last bullet count as ammo and health is apparently scarce--at first, anyway. You always have to be careful when faced with a large horde of enemies or a bossfight--you never know what's going to empty your ammo supply and force you to utilize your knife.\n\nThe story and dialogue is cheesy as hell, but it's incredibly fun and fits the game like a glove. While maintaining a serious presence, it isn't afraid to make you laugh or throw in a ridiculous scenario or set piece every once in awhile.\n\nResident Evil 4 is a solid 10/10. To me, I find absolutely no faults in this game whatsoever, and I'm excited to go through all of the bonus content and new game+.",Recommended

"This is an old game so the review won't be too long.\n\nGameplay-\n\nHoly fuck this game still outclasses every fucking third person shooter to date. Pretty much every fucking TPS game these days got its ideas from this game. This game made shooting enemies in the face for 20 hours FUN. Blowing off a head never fucking got old. The game also changes it up every now and then to keep it exciting. They give you fucking mine carts, they give you fucking harpoons, they give you fucking creepy mazes, oh you want some jet skis too? This game has that as well. This game's got it all. This game kicks fucking ass. Why can't Capcom make games like this anymore? Some people complain that this game wasn't as scary as the originals and that the puzzles were way too easy. Who the fuck wants to solve puzzles in a zombie game? The puzzles in the originals were boring as fuck and pointless filler to make the games seem longer. The original RE's weren't even fucking scary. They just had a shitty camera and shitty controls to make up for the fact that it wasn't scary. Some people actually want them to put the overhead camera in the next RE game, Fuck no. The overhead camera was acceptable in the PS1 era but not now. The older RE's sucked balls and you know it. Metal Gear Solid had an overhead camera and it was 1000000000x better than the shitty RE games. They weren't even fucking scary. The only thing scary about them was the shitty controls. How many people do you know would be that fucking slow when zombies are chasing them? RE4 is better in every conceivable way, and manages to be pretty creepy at times even though it doesn't shitty camera angles. The inventory in this game also kicks ass because you can carry multiple weapons at once but have to choose what weapons and how much space you will leave for healing herbs, ammo, etc. It makes you really think about what you will carry and makes it a little more tactical. This game also gives a ton of content since you got the main game, which is around 20 hours long. A kick ass Professional mode ( New game +) an awesome round wave type mode called Mercenaries, an extra 5-6 hour campaign where you play as this hot chick named Ada who is one of the characters in the game, another hour long minigame where you play as her collecting stuff, and a ton of costume, bottle caps, and weapons to unlock. It also has a lot of secrets in game. I fucking love this game and hate Capcom for abandoning all this cool shit. The bosses and weapons kick ass as well. The game also manages to be hard but not frustrating because when you die it's usually your fault.\n\nSound-\nThe sound in this game fucking rocks. The quality may be outdated but interestingly enough it still beats every game out there in terms of atmosphere and shit. The sound in this game makes you feel like you're fucking there. The thunder and rain, the chantings of the enemies, the creepy regenerator sounds, this game is fucking awesome. The sound in this game kicks ass. I masturbated to the sound of ashley crying out for leon like a little bitch. The VA is not bad, the dialogue is cheesy but it's almost perfectly delivered and made me crack up quite a bit.\n\nGraphics-\n\nOk this HD port sucks ass but since it's a 9 year old game I'll give it some slack. The game looks kind of muddy but it still looks a lot better than alot of games these days such as The Saboteur and there's never any frame rate slowdowns or any bullshit like that. The HD port looks pretty much the same as the Wii version except it brings back the laser sight which makes it alot better since you can't just shoot all over the place and it cleans up some of the textures a bit so as not to make your eyes disintegrate. It still looks kind of shitty at some parts but it's definitely bearable and the gameplay still kicks fucking ass regardless.\n\nStory\n\nOk usually I would rip on a story like this but the reason I don't is because even though the story is really fucking cheesy the game actually acknowledges this and doesn't take itself too seriously. It's actually quite enjoyable and the dialogue is fucking hilarious. Some of Leon's lines are awesome. Though the story is cheesy it does keep you involved and the cutscenes are short and get to the point. Eitherway, the gameplay kicks ass.",Recommended

There's just a sense of pure satisfaction when it comes to Resident Evil 4, going through vast, dark maps, killing zombies, getting the crap scared out of you on more than a couple ocassions, saving the obnoxious hot girl, and then doing it again like 15 times.

Being one of my favorite games, I decided to go and buy it recently for my PC. The tank controls almost drove me demented! \n\nI want the main character to run the direction my mouse is looking, but it won't do it. If I am missing something here then please forgive me.

"EDITED REVIEW, OLD REVIEW AFTER THIS UPDATED ONE\n\nHoly shit. It's been upwards of a decade since I was introduced to this game. And I hated it ever since. Only thing is, I never really abandoned it after not liking it, because my little brother absolutely loves it. So after struggling with this port, controllers not working, and my general hate for it, I did the same thing as I do each year, and on my new years resolution list, put 'Enjoying Resi 4 for once' onto it. And well, I finally managed.\n\nYou can read my old review of one of my yearly attempts below. This time around, I said 'fuck it' to a controller, and went at it mouse and keyboard stlye. Ballsy, I know. And god dammit, it worked. I got a hang of the controls, and started off fresh, just taking the game at face value. And something gave for once. Not much of the cons I listed from last time really carry over either. Now, I have some more pros. A lot more. One major one, is the feeling of looking at the situation ahead (like the amount of enemies to beat or a large ass boss) and getting that ""And how the FUCK am I going to beat that thing"" feeling. It really works out well, especially after you beat the enemy. However, that leads into a personal con of mine. Sometimes, they REALLY throw a hefty amount of bad guys at you, and it tends to feel really hopeless and claustrophobic, and you're really just waiting for it to end. \n\nOh and one major con that DID carry over. She may be cute. She may huddle behind you when you shoot and fist bump when you kill an enemy but dear god.\n\nAshley is still damn annoying.\n\nHalf the time I'll just enter a stage and make her wait, just so I can clear the area out before I let her follow me. I also hate when I get completely surrounded by a shitload of enemies and I cant run otherwise she gets caught. I think shes the reason I enjoy Resi 5 a lot. Having a person that follows you everywhere that actually helps out is a great feeling in contrast to this game. \nAnd you know what else is great about Sheva compared to Ashley?\n\nShe knows how to go down a fucking ladder.\n\nAnyway yeah. Thanks for reading if you did.\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________\n                                                      OLD REVIEW\n\n\nI know to some of you, that not recommending this game is completely sacrilegious, but just hear me out, I have my reasonings.\n\nPros: [list]\n[*]Save music\n[/list]\n\nSlight Cons:[list]\n [*]Bit crushed villager sounds\n[*]Weird motion blur during any movement\n[*]Bullets seem to deal the same amount of damage as a thrown pebble\n[*]Can't rotate items in the inventory with keyboard and mouse\n[/list]\n\n\n\nCons: [list]\n[*]Leon is 1/4th of the screen\n[*]Shitty ""we didnt know what to do so we just introduced a pack of enemies in a cutscene and let you fight them off"" moments\n[*]Camera controls are god awful and the only response from the community you get about it is ""HAHA u Cant play with a brokEn Ass nauseating camera???? what are you a pussy????""\n[/list]\n\nHeavy Cons: [list]\n[*]~95% of the game is an obnoxious rescue mission\n[*]Babysitting Ashley is hell\n[*]Quick Time Events\n[/list]\n\nThis game is the Caitlyn Jenner of videogames. Everyone praises it for doing absolutely nothing of signifigance.\n\nAnd for the record, this is not my first time trying to see why people like this game.

"First off, this is a very good game.  One of my favorites actually.  So I recommend the game itself.  Just, don't buy this version if you have Windows 10.  The game crashes without fail after an undetermined amount of time playing.  For a game where save points are supposed to be far from each other to build tension, this is a huge problem.  I've tried running in compatability mode, running as an administrator, running on the lowest settings, and a combination of some or all of these.  It just does not work on Windows 10 and apparently Capcom has abandoned support for this game.

They claim that they fixed it using the mouse but the game was better in the older version without the mouse control feature.  It aims like shit and the issue they had in the old version where when you leave the 1st town and they roll a rock down on you and you have to run and dodge it.

"First of all, despite having 'received this product for free', that only applies to this specific Steam version, which I gladly would have paid for. I won it in a giveaway when it was first released here, and I had planned on buying it otherwise, so please don't let that aspect taint your thoughts on this review. This is actually my 5th time owning Resident Evil 4 (1st = Gamecube / 2nd = PS2 / 3rd = Wii / 4th = Xbox 360). I can't get enough. It's easily in my top 5, free copy or not, and for good reason. \n\nWhy is it so good?\n\nIt's a fun gameplay loop within a gameplay loop. Moment-to-moment, you use satisfying weapons to take out murderous villagers in satisfying ways. Shooting at their legs, and then coming in for the kick, and THEN knifing them when they're down (to save ammo) is a lot of fun, especially when you're trying that tactic with more than a few villagers. With quite a few variances, you're more or less doing that for most encounters.\n\nThe larger gameplay loop is, once you beat the game, you get to keep your upgraded weapons, with a few more open to purchase. You get to be extremely overpowered, and it's incredibly cathartic to revisit previously-difficult encounters without a worry or care as you exact revenge. One-shotting bosses, laying waste to large groups of enemies without concerning yourself with ammo conservation, and being able to zip through otherwise long and tedious sequences is incredible, and keeps me coming back for more.\n\nAnd that's just the main campaign! In addition to that, you've got two side stories featuring Ada Wong, with slight changes in gameplay, and the Mercenaries mode, which is Resident Evil 4's take on a Horde mode, of sorts. Limited time, unlimited enemies, see if you can stay alive until the helicopter arrives. The incentive to beat all of these extras comes in the form of even more upgraded/powerful weaponry and costumes (Ashley in the Knight suit for life) for the main campaign.\n\nI can't recommend it enough.",Recommended

"Don't look at the hours that are shown here, i played this game on ps2 way back in the days. The game itself is a masterpiece in my opinion. The gameplay, story, everything is so good in this game. Of course, there are some cons like clumsy controls and a bad aiming system which requires time to get used to and i would suggest getting a controler (or at least that's what i think because i got used to playing this game that way. Also it litteraly takes like 30 minutes to get used to the controls, so i say that it's not that big of a deal). The atmosphere itself is very fitting too. Constant fog, creepy forest, village, even the castle used to give me the chills. The game also has loads of cool easter eggs which i won't cover here but i would suggest looking it up if you're interested. If you haven't played this game, what are you waiting for?! Hurry up and try it if you're a huge fan of horror games (even if you're not, this game is something unique). Maybe i'm not from ""those"" times but for me this game is the best one in the RE series no matter what ""Recommended"" fans say and i think a lot of people can agree with me on that.",Recommended
"It's Resident Evil 4, and after the millions of editions that have come out over the past 12 years it's difficult to find somebody who hasn't actually played this in one form or another. Nothing has changed gameplay wise, it set the way for third person shooters with it's mechanics and 'behind-the-shoulder' view, with games coming out twelve years later still making use of them. \n\nAs for this being the Ultimate Edition? I don't think so. Some textures are touched up but the majority remain the same. Many of the animations haven't been redone in 60fps, so the majority of the animations in the game look quite choppy when playing at 60fps. I find that I get frame drops in the most random of times. \n\nThe game includes all of the extras from the previous versions such as the Mercenaries and Seperate Ways, but sadly there isn't anything new. Aside from 60fps and some touched up textures, the game remains the same. If you're itching to play it then I'd get it, but just know that you'll be experiencing the same game that's come out a hundred times.",Recommended
"This game has never worked for me. Opening clip is all out of sync, and the game itself is frozen almost stiff. Great game I played on gamecube. Can't get this title to work, and I can't get a refund. Wasted money for me.",Not Recommended
"Only 8.5 out of 10!\n\nResident Evil 4 Ultimate HD is a great edition of its original version.\n\nIt feels great to play this game again on 60fps but..\n\nGraphical texture is still the same.\n\nWhen UbiSoft published the water-down version of this game in 2006, it was a mess.\n\nThen, mod-commmunity upload free texture improvement, and the game become better!\n\nWhy Capcom didn't include upgraded texture on this version? \n\nI am not asking for realistic quality texture. All I want is some rocks, dirt, doors, treasure not to look blurry, low quality. This should not be hard to make. At least, all interactive onjects should have updated graphics quality.\n\nThe most annoying thing that Capcom haven't made is to update Ada Spearate Ways cutscenes.\n\nOverall, is the same experience from previous version but better FPS, extras from PS2 version (Ada Separate Ways), and Wii quality (i guess).",Recommended

"Resident Evil 4 was my first game of this series i played tho i heard a lot about the game series befor i was never intrested to play any of them. I wasnt even intrested in Res4 but buyed it a view years after release because it was cheap so i didnt expect really much of this game.\nThis game has a cheesy story and dialog but thats part of the fun this games makes.\nThe controlls and camera position you can love or hate, in my opinion its the right mix to not be a real shooter because you must decide when to shoot or to run. I enjoyed this game a lot.",Recommended

"[h1]  Resident Evil 4 / Biohazard 4 [/h1]\n[i] This is the fourth and remastered edition of the games in the series. In a game we play as a well known to us police officer from Raccoon City, Leon S. Kennedy, which is currently a secret agent of the US government. Our ancestor is sent on a secret mission to Europe to find the president's missing daughter. The clues bring our hero to a small town in Spain where we realize that this is not the usual town. When if was not enough for the people the game offer the main campaing but also additional campaigns ""Seperate Ways"" where you play as Ada Wong, where as the agent of the Umbrella Corporation her task is to get a sample of the virus. Mercenary mode, where as different characters in the game we have to survive on the map and collect points. Personally, in my opinion it is the best game in the series I have ever played. The game has a great sound system, charismatic characters, very good gameplay where you have to constantly think and conserve ammo, great atmosphere and interesting story. The biggest downside of this production is controls, for me personally I do not mind but many people may hate. Apparently the game has support for the mouse and keyboard, but definitely a game more comfortably on the gamepad. This does not change the fact that it is much better than the original. However, before buying I advise you to think about that.",Recommended

"First thing's first. Resident Evil 4 was the end of the series as we knew it. And it still bothers me to no end at times.\n\nMore than 10 years later, having spend hundreds of hours in this game ever since the GameCube release, I can finally say I found some appreciation for the game. It did so many things right I simply cannot hold any kind of grudge against it. Even if it did kill my favourite series.\n\nSo here we go... 4 points about RE4.\n\n1) Resident Evil 4 is not survival horror. It is action horror through and through. The horror IS still there no matter if it works for you or not. Horror has many faces and RE4 has traded the quieter, claustrophobic, atmospheric, jump scare spiced horror of the previous games for intense, over the top, in way over your head kind of fear. This game is intense. The atmosphere is also still there, but once you reach the castle it is not nearly as effective.\n\n2) Resident Evil 4 is silly as f*ck. The story is completely bonkers and cannot be taken seriously. The moment you reach the castle, the game not only looses steam a little bit but it also looses any last sense of very, very loose reality it has been operating on at the beginning. The level design gets seriously eye rolling through the roof with silly, improbable traps and lava rooms.\n\n3) The game turns into an escort mission from chapter 3 onwards. It helps the intensity at places but can get annoying. Especially in the water room. Ashley is also extremely annoying so that does not help either.\n\n4) The gameplay is extremely well polished and fun. Even after 10+ years. Once you get used to the controls, though I neved had any problems with them.",Recommended

If you have a decent system you shouldn't have to worry at all.\nDon't just stand there, BUY IT!\nI've beaten the game three times already.",Recommended
"This is the point that Resident evil stopped being good and turned into just another third person crappy shooter. The controlls are horrible, the F.O.V. is pitiful, and because you can now manipulate the camera there are no more ""what's waiting for me around the corner"" moments. If you are a fan of GOOD horror games then stick with the early RE titles or Silent Hill games as this is just terrible.\n\nNo Resident Evil game should have a higher body count than your average CoD campaign.",Not Recommended

"What a fantastic game. Resident Evil is horror action game at its best. We play as special agent Leon Kennedy, our mission is to find president doughter and get her safley to home. All we know is that she was kidnapped by some sect. No more need to know if you didnt played it, story is simple but interesting. As i mentioned before its classified as horror game, its more like a 3rd person shooter placed in horror envierment, no jump scares, only bunch of ''zombies''. Tho there are moments of really high scary action, like when we fight Verdugo or our first contact with Regenerador. So if your interested in buying a horror game, there are many better picks. What i must say about the game, is atmosphere. Its best part of the game. Heavy, dark and bronze collored adventure. No horror movie got me to adventure like this game, i was simply sucked in. This edition of game features mouse control, for me it was good, it took about 1 hour to get used to it, but after this time you get really skilled in it. Game is long, about 16 hours for me, but there is still more for me to play, there are many other missions that take place in time of our actions. It lets you to look at the adventure from all perspectives. What can i say? Its 10/10 action game. Trust me, its AWESOME, i am not a fan of horror games, but this atmosphere and tension give you great expirience. Must play for all game fans, specially that it costs less than 5$, its a must have.",Recommended

"4/10\n\nBefore I go on, let me just start by saying that I grew up with Resident Evil and it will always hold a special place in my heart. I really wanted to enjoy this, and It's a shame that It took me this long to finally play through it. The reviews and critical acclaim this game has received alone almost guaranteed my satisfaction, but I was sorely disappointed. I don't know what I missed here, honestly, but this heap of sheep shit plays nothing and feels nothing like the RE I grew up with. Which is fine, I welcome a breath of fresh air. The story wasn't all that bad, but just about everything else built a hateful fire inside of me which wouldn't extinguish until I finally completed the game.\n\nPros:\n\n- Some familiar faces\n- Satisfactory weapon selection\n- Generously expandable Inventory\n- Plenty of Loot\n- Enjoyable puzzles\n\nCons:\n\n- Some of THEE WORST and most frustrating camera and character controls EVER\n- QTE's are overused, especially during frantic battle sequences\n- QTE's are also randomly scattered and pop up unexpectedly\n- Horrendous voice acting and dialog\n- Enemy/Boss difficulty is rediculously unbalanced at times\n- Story is 99% unrelated to previous titles\n\nSeriously, the camera and character controls made me want to hurt someone every other second.....",Not Recommended

"This game is the absolute best take on the survival-horror genre and contender for the best game ever made. It nails every single point of gameplay perfectly; It's paced perfectly, the diffuculty appropriately ramps up the farther you go along, enemies are nicely varied. You are never in a comfortable situation and you WILL have to utilize everything in your arsenal to get through. Gameplay is smooth and intuitive. Bosses are perhaps the best part, especially early on when you're poorly armed and inexperienced. The more you learn the more the game rewards you. This game will kick your sorry butt for one reason; the way you aim. You can't move and shoot at the same time making postioning an immediate priority above everything else. Some people may complain about this but it's silly. The way you aim makes it much more immersive and realistic in the sense that all your focus on the shooting. Story could use some polish, but it's literally only a nitpick in the great adventure that is RE4. \n\n\nBOTTOM LINE: Every person, at some point in their life, needs to play this game. In fact out of all the other Resident Evil games this really should be the only one you play. It's the best of the best. A damn near perfect game. \n\nScore: 9.9/10",Recommended
Good story and gameplay. Always wanted to beat this one and finally did. Would recommend 9/10.,Recommended
While i feel this game is really awesome but the port quality is pretty much garbage but if u have a graphics card like a 750ti or above it should be fine since it was for me BUT milage may varie so if u like this game at 60fps 1080p and max graphics is really great the game is awesome.But the port is not good but not the worst so u need a actual gaming pc not some intel hd graphics bc that wont cut it,Recommended

"Resident Evil 4 marked in 2005 a new era for the Resi Franchise. RE 1-3 used a different engine and were more focused on Horror while RE 5-6 have a stronger focus on action. RE4 feels like a hybrid, which combines the horror and the action in a very spectacular fashion and is because of that seen by many gamers as the best Resident Evil game and generally as one of the best games of it`s generation and maybe one of the best of all times. \n\nYou play as Leon Kennedy, who was sent on a mission to secure the president`s daughter in east Europe. The Story is absolutely great and brings you through strange villages, a dark castle and an island of doom. What truly makes the game is the wonderful and very scary atmosphere. You will have the feeling to be on a real survival trip. The Gameplay is very smooth, feels quite natural. Even though you have to mention that dodging enemies can be a bit difficult due to the radius of movement from Leon. Another complaint of mine are the quick time events. Sometimes they are enjoyable, but if you die after a 10 mins fight scene because you didn`t press the buttons fast enough and have to repeat the whole section again it feels a bit annoying. But those are minor details, which do not reduce the giant amount of joy provided by this game.\n\nThe Steam version of the game has improved graphics in comparison to the original release and also includes the additional mode Separate ways, which will be unlocked after beating the game for the first time. The normal campaign is about 15 hours long and separate ways will give you another 5 hours of material. \n    \nPro: \n•	Horror at its best\n•	Amazing Action\n•	Great Story\n•	Smooth Gameplay\n•	High replayability due to different difficulty settings and unlockables\n\nContra:\n•	Quicktime events sometimes annoying\n•	High radius of movement\n\nResult: This game is a Recommended masterpiece and can be recommended to literally everybody.\n\n9.5/10",Recommended

"TL;DR\n\nWhile it's a massive departure from previous Resident Evil games, [i]Resident Evil 4[/i] is a great example of survival action done well.  It's not a frightening adventure, instead relying on close quarters action with massive mobs of varying enemy types. Ammo is scarce, health is rarer, but death is plentiful. The controls are strange, the story is campy, and the game is essentially a glorified escort mission, but it always manages to keep things entertaining with its intensity and non-stop progression. This is one of my favorite games of all time.\n\n* * *\n\nFULL CRITIQUE\n\n[i]Resident Evil 4[/i] is an action-horror-survival game by Capcom. It stars Leon Kennedy, survivor of the Raccoon City crisis and current protectorate of the President's family. Right when he is commissioned, the President's daughter goes missing in Europe. Within the first few minutes he realizes that this is more than a simple abduction. Parasite monsters, giant ogres, and a massive cult operation have wrapped the area up in chaos, and Ashely is right in the middle of it. By whatever means necessary, Leon is expected to save the girl and stop the terrorists from causing further harm.\n\n[b]+[/b]It's campy as hell. Dialogue is clearly designed based on Hollywood tropes and cliches, leading to an endless amount of one-liners and 'holier-than-thou' villain speeches. Performances are, surprisingly, pretty well done. The actors avoid the grittiness that plagued the next two games and clearly have fun with their work.\n[b]+[/b]It's not a very scary game, but it's still a frantic one. You'll be swarmed often and be forced to sacrifice precious ammunition to slip out of deadly situations. There are plenty of melee moves that are triggered by shooting enemies in certain areas, so there are plenty of strategies you have to use to figure out how to best conserve your weapons. The monsters do have frightening designs, but most of the time you'll be fighting normal minions. There are only a few specific parts in the game that are particularly horrific, and each of them are due to the restricted amount of space you are given to work with. So in tight quarters, this game excels the most. Combat can be a bit wonky in the beginning, but once you learn how to use them effectively it feels very good for the game.\n[b]+[/b]Weapon progression is one of the best aspects of the game. Spending currency gained from tough enemies and hidden treasure allows you to upgrade your weapons or trade them in for other ones. Each weapon is viable in its own way, so it's impossible to make a bad decision. As long as you have a balanced loadout, you can make it through the game. This progression paired with new game plus makes it one of the best games to play more than once. Additionally, playing through the game and its extra modes yields unlockable weapons and outfits.\n[b]+[/b]I know it's an HD remaster, but the graphics have held up. Leon's hair looks better than what most modern day protagonists have to offer, and the animations are still convincingly realistic. It's easier to witness small flaws in cutscenes, but in game it's still very pleasant to look at. It suffers from using very dull colors, but it's hardly a glaring issue. For being over ten years old, it's impressive.\n[b]+[/b]Mercenaries, an arena arcade mode featuring a slew of unique characters, is incredibly fun. Each character has unique attacks, loadouts, and animations. It's something that really didn't need to be included, as there's already plenty to do, but it makes the game hold up even more. The addition of this mode is evidence that a lot of heart was put into the making of the game.\n\n[b]-[/b]The side operations involving Ada aren't nearly as fun as the campaign. The main campaign overshadows it, and the lack of progression makes it unnecessary to play through again. That and the cutscenes weren't updated in HD. The resolution is awful, and it often takes scenes from the normal game and just replays them. It's nice to have the extra content, but it just wasn't as enjoyable.",Recommended
"By many considered the best in the series. I beg to disagree - I dropped it after an hour or so The game is dated, steering is terrible (you use right stick to look left/right like in a racing game), user interface is akward and destroys immersion. I got it cheap in a Humble Bundle so not a big waste.  Never listen to those nostalgia zombies. Revelations 1 and 2 is much better. RE5 is much better.  Even RE6 is much better.",Not Recommended
"Resident Evil 4 is a good thrird person shooter with gory, creepy and violent on top.\n\nYou play as Leon S. Kennedy, a returning character from the resident evil games of the PSX Era. His mission is to rescue the U.S.' presidents daughter and his lead lead him to a remote region of Spain, something like Transylvania would be for Romania, you get the picture (i hope). So you get there and people start to attack without reason, the game begins. \n\nThe ennemies drop ammo, money and loot to be sold for money to a merchant that you will see throughout the game who is on the ""money's side"", he can upgrade and sell you weapons, which have stats (Power, reload speed, fire rate, etc ...). This is a violent game and i remember in 2004 when it came out on gamecube only feeling at peace after a game session involving shotgun blasts to the face. The game has its fair share of QTE, i don't mind them but if you do there is the news: they're in the game. Sadly you still can't move while aiming ... but you'll get used to that and it won't botter you.\n\nI really urge you to install Alberts HD textures for RE4 : http://www.re4hd.com/\nThey did an insane job recreating textures FROM ORIGINAL ART and it's faithful to the original only x times sharper and detailed. They deserve our respect.\n\nSo let's rate this game already:\nGraphics 5/5\nStory 3.5/5\nGameplay 4/5\nAtmosphere 5/5\nLenght 5/5 (Long compared to other survival horror games although it can be considered as an action game by some but still ...",Recommended

"My favorite game of the RE series and of all time. Not only does it bring some nostalgia to me when I first played on the gamecube, but it's a pretty fun game!\n\nA gloomy rural village in Europe is where the game takes place. You get to play as Leon and rescue the President's daughter (who is kind of  a pain in the ass sometimes in the game) while also taking down a cult that is infected with an ancient parasite. The game is pretty solid and I still remmeber how scared I was when I was younger. \n\nThe Regenerators are still terrifying to me, though. :(\n\nAnyways, after beating the campaign once, you can unlock a cool costume. And then a third after beating it the second time. If you finish the campaign and don't want to play it anymore, you can always play Mercenaries or Seperate Ways, a side story in which you play Ada's part in the game. \n\nExcellent game and will always be my favorite.

Not really. Is it good today? Yes. The game has aged, but its still fun. Some regard this game as one of the greatest games ever made, and i see why. For me, a game should be in a greatist list because of what it did to evolve its genre, and still hold up decently even when the shine wears off and the times change. In this regard, it is a masterpice because of its legacy, and because it does stand the test of time in 2016 aswell. \n\nResident evil 4 is a class act, a classic. Is it perffect? No. There is no such thing. But its  part of gaming history, it deserves the love and respect gamers have for it to this day .",Recommended

"Resident Evil 4 may have been released just over a decade ago, but it still was able to impress me in 2016. It was definitely revolutionary in defining third person shooters for the time and I can absolutely see why. The combat, the movement, the level design, the music, the enemy design, and the visuals are all fantastic. Resident Evil 4 itself, is a GREAT game. It has a ton of content for what it is, with the main story taking from 10-20 hours, not even including the two additional story missions where you get to play as another character from the game. The main story also has a ton of replayability once you unlock things such as the Infinite Launcher and the Typewriter Thompson, which are incredibly fun to screw around with. While many define this game as a giant ""Escort Mission"" (which I can't argue against, it certainly is an escort mission for a large portion of the game), it does it right. The AI you escort is smart, it hides behind you when you shoot, can be hidden in combat to avoid harm, and is helpful for many puzzles, so if anything, I enjoyed the company of a partner on my journey. \n\nThere is only ONE issue I had with this port for PC. The frame rate adjustments in the settings menu are bugged. If you set the game at 60 FPS, a very common issue occurs where the game literally goes into slow motion at random times, and Leon moves REALLY slow. It's quite a strange glitch, and I haven't found any technical explanation for it. The only way to fix this is to set the game to 30 FPS unfortunately. After doing so however, I found no issues with it, as the game was absolutely playable. If you're bothered by this, you may want to seek the console port for Xbox One and PlayStation 4, as that may behold the 60 FPS you MUST have, however, at the time of writing it is not released, so do not hold me to that. \n\nAll in all, Resident Evil 4 is one of my favorite games. It represented the third person shooter and zombie genre in a well deserved and respectful manner. If you're a fan of the Resident Evil games and haven't played it, I certainly would recommend it, as it is praised greatly within the RE community and provides a very unique zombie experience. Even if you're just a casual gamer such as myself, I still would recommend it. It is, in general, a GOOD game, not really selective of its audience. Absolutely recommended.",Recommended

"Hey, it's pretty good.  Resident Evil 4 was originally released in 2005 for the gamecube, the ps2, and the xbox 360.  It was later released for basically every other platform after the 5th console generation (besides the ouya).  And now, we have the HD edition.  The game's the same as it always was, but now it's on PC.  It is obviously a console port, so it controls like 	𝗌𝗁𝗂𝗍, but you get used to it after a while.  It also has mouse acceleration, and I can't find a way to turn that off.  I'm sure there's some forum post on some years old forum that says how to do it, but I couldn't be 𝖿𝗎𝖼𝗄𝖾𝖽 to go looking for it, so I had to deal with that.  Besides those two things, the game is really fun.  At $20, it's well worth every penny.  I've managed to drop 18 hours on one playthrough of this, so I'm sure there's plenty more fun to be had.  Also, you can unlock special 𝗌𝗁𝗂𝗍 after you beat the game on normal, like 'professional' mode, and some other cool 𝗌𝗁𝗂𝗍 at the merchant's place.  Professional mode is just like normal mode but the enemies have more health, are smarter, and ammo is more difficult to find, if I remember correctly.  Overall, this game would get a 9/10 for having 𝗌𝗁𝗂𝗍 controls on pc.  You can just plug in an xbox controller though.  I didn't have one.",Recommended
"I really wish I could recommend this port, but if you're PC is only average, you'll probably experience frequent crashes every ten minutes like I have.

"One of the greatest games the franchise has ever seen, Resident Evil 4 has been one of my most beloved games throughout my history of playing it on Gamecube, Ps2, Xbox 360, and now even PC. I'm not sure what it is about the game, but it is one of the few games that I find more and more entertaining each time I play a new game plus or try on the hardest difficulty. \n\nPros:\n-Cheesy but loveable voice acting and characters\n-Leon is actually cool (Unlike RE6's Leon)\n-Gunplay is extremely fun and satisfying\n-Replay value is infinite\n-Fun little extra gamemodes to play (Seperate ways, Assignment Ada)\n-A healthy number of guns to try and to upgrade\n-An inventory system OCD people will adore\n-Bosses that are challenging though they may lack in combat creativity\n-Some puzzles that are a bit challenging \n-Enemies stay tough enough to provide a challenge and they appear with new weapons and ""boss"" enemies\n\nCons:\n-PC ""Biohazard"" may still be slow when there are a lot of particles to display (Like a LOT of explosions or an excessive amount of any effect displayed) especially with the last boss fight.\n-As I said in Pro's, bosses are kind of easy to beat once you get the hang of things\n-May be times when you are helpless to a horde of enemies with flails that hit you infinitly and kill you\n-""HELP ME LEON""\n\nOverall:\n-This game has followed me through several systems and I still play it relentlessly today, maybe it's just me, but I can't help but love the life out of this game, and I reccomend it if you're looking for a RE game that isn't all horror or all action as the franchise has been lately, it has a perfect blend of each.

If you have not played this game yet do yourself a service and buy this game. At this point its such a legend in video game history it will be referenced in lots of other games and media. Any hardcore gamer should play this.\n\nAlso this port is pretty good. PC and gamepad controls work good. All the major boxes are checked in the visual graphics menu including an option to use the HD or original SD graphics.

"RESIDENT EVIL 4\n  Oh boy, this game.\nThere has been a lot said about this game already, honestly, probably going to be repeating a lot of what has been said, but I will try my best to give my honest review and opinion.\n\nPORT\n  \n  Never once did I crash while playing this game, the framerate was smooth as can be, though there was some animations in the game locked to 30 FPS, and that does stick out like a sore thumb, but doesn't really hurt the game.\n	\nGAMEPLAY\n  \n  Here we are, the bread and butter of RE4, the main reason why people play this game to this day.  Prepare for this gameplay section of this review to be LONG, because really, RE4 is all about that gameplay.\n  \n  Back in 2004 when this game came out, it took the world by storm, noboby was expecting this game to be THAT good, critics, and fans all loved it.  The gameplay it self is a over the shoulder shooter, with survival horror elements.  Bullet counting and ladder camping are needed if you want to have enough ammo to make it past this game.  One of the most rememered elements from this game is its inventory system, yes, the infamous tetris minigame we call an inventory.  Strangely enough, this actually added to the game by somes peoples account and added to the suspenion of this alreadly chilling game.  The reason for this being is simple, back in the good ol' days of RE1,2,and 3, it was just a simple inventory system, 1 space for most items, 2 for some.  When RE4 came out, it wasn't a question of did you have enough space, but rather, COULD you make enough space.  It's a weird thing to think about, but I personally love it.\n  \n  Quite possibly the most praised element of gameplay from RE4 was the hitbox reactions.  Shoot an enemy in the head, run up, kick 'em.  Shoot an enemy in the leg, run up, suplex them.  This was a simple element that added much depth to the game and how to conserve ammo.  One of the things Shinji Mikami focused on while making RE4 was not only making it scary, but fun as well.  That is why we see huge battle moments in RE4, something completely new to the series.  And funny enough, we see it copied in later RE titles such as RE5 and 6, but they don't do to good do they...well, that is completely subjective.\n  \n  WHO LIKES ESCORT MISSIONS?! No one? Well too bad, 'cause here you go.  Yes, quite possibly the most infamous gameplay element of RE4 is escorting Ashley.(Mabye only rivaled by the QTE's)  Prepare to babysit, cause that is a lot of this game.  Some might argue that it adds to the overall stress of the game of having to watch out for another person besides yourself, but reality is, is that most people put Ashley in a suit of amour when they can. \n  \n  WHO LIKES UPGRADING GUNS?!  All of you? Good, 'cause there is A LOT of that as well.  One of my favorite parts of RE4 is choosing my weapons, unlike in todays games where there is a clear and overall BEST GUN, RE4 does not have that(excluding Handcannon, Infinite Launcher, Parasite Gun, and Tommy Gun.)  The beginning handgun may not have the best damage, but does have the added benifit of 5x critical headshots.  The punisher can shoot through mutiple enemies, the blacktail is the most well rounded gun with the best handling, and the red9 boosts pure power.  That is just to name a couple of guns, to name them all, would be a list all on its own. \n\nINCOMING WALL OF TEXT\n  The level of challenge you will recieve while playing this game can vary, are you A) a person who looks around everywhere and searches for hidden treasures and ammo? Or B) a person who blindly rushes the enemies and does not observe their environment?  If you answer either of these, then you will still die.  A LOT.  One more then the other...  Resident Evil 4 does not pull punches,  ESPECIALLY near the end.  Just beat a boss? Great, now go take on a battle town that is LITERALLY one room ahead of the boss.  Beat the battle town?  Good for you! the final boss is about 4 rooms ahead... Veterans of RE4 know what I am talking about.  That being said, all of that is on NORMAL.  After you beat normal, Pro mode is unlocked, and let me tell you...pro mode...is actually REALLY FREAKIN' FUN!  \n  \n  Don't get me wrong, pro mode can be absolute hell in the beginning, but pro mode FORCES you to play diffrently in contrast to normal.  But once you start getting the swing of things, you will find yourself really REALLY loving RE4 and its level of challenge.  But that is just me, if you don't really like being challenged by games, and prefer easy, smooth going games, then you might want to steer clear of this game.  But if you really want to try out RE4 none the less, This PC version does come with an easy mode.  Some might make fun of it, but I think it is a great feature to reach out to several types of gamers out there...though after Pro mode...I don't think I could go back to anything lower...\n  \n  To finally finish off the gameplay section of this review, lets talk about replayability. RE4 has unlockables, such as extra guns for  beating the normal game.  An extra campaign called seperate ways is unlocked, that also has unlockables.  Assignment Ada, another little short minigame, has unlockables for the main game.  Mercenaries makes a return, guess what? Beat all levels with 5 stars on every character? Unlockables.  You like costumes?  We got that.  Beat pro mode? Unlockables.  There is A LOT of things to do after you beat the game.  RE4 even has freakin' New Game+.  Why?  Because it's that awesome.  You can easily sink over 100 hours of gameplay into this game.... Finally freakin' done with the gameplay...\n	STORY\n  The story is nothing special at all, really it's just there to have a game.  This game might as well be a hollywood film, because it is that predictable.  Not going to spoil anything but you know...the story is there.\n...and already done with story...what does that tell you about this game hm?\n	\nCONCLUSION\n  \n  If you have never played RE4 before, you might want to give it a try if you are a fan of survival horror action games.  Access to this game is really easy since RE4 is basically on EVERY CONSOLE.  The freakin' Wii got its own version of this game!  IT'S COMING TO PS4 AND \nXBOX 1 NEXT MONTH!  But if you have played the game before...you might not want to get it.  See, one bad thing I will say about this game and its 1 MILLION RERELEASES is that...it added nothing new... So basically if you played the PS2 version of this game, then you have already played it before.  Unless you are just in it for the new graphics, and if thats the case, jump on board!\n	RATING\n  9/10(only because of QTE's)",Recommended

"Resident Evil 4 is the (much beloved) black sheep of the Resident Evil series. While still maintaining the classic tank control scheme from a new perspective, Resi4 takes the prerendered action adventure series and turns it into an arcade action game. While the over the shoulder camera angle and setpiece levels lends itself as a more cinematic adventure, Resi4 is a thoroughly mechanically focused game and uses its tight and limited camera angle to create a claustrophobic survival thriller experience which no other game has managed to successfully replicate, including Capcom's own later efforts. If there is any grand flaw in this game, it's that Capcom explored the gameplay experiences this sort of 3rd person combat could provide so definitively in this one game that ironically it sort of refutes the need for another game to follow up on what this game provided. \n\nMy only hangup is how mediocre this port is. I was almost ready to give this game the thumbs down because I was struggling to make this port work at all. Resi4 was never optimized to run at 60 fps, and that sadly remains Recommended of this port. I ended up playing the game at 30 fps in order for it to be playable. This might be the only pc game in which anyone would recommend playing at 30 fps over 60, but there are other reasons besides optimization. It's clear that this game was designed to be played at the 30 fps mark, with mechanics, play speed and animation timing all built around a locked 30 fps. This isn't so much a failing of Resi4 or Capcom, but more a testament to how thoroughly this game was built to run for the system it was originally made for. There is nothing wrong with building a game around the limitations of the hardware it was meant for, many classic console games were made for the purposes of playing well on their native console. But it also means that when straight ports such as this one are made that they risk turning off die hard pc fans who refuse to drop below 60. If it's any consolation, this game plays very well at 30, and is one of the few pc games I'd ever play in which I was happy to play at 30 fps. This thumbs up is for how great Resi4 is to this day, despite the quality of this port and not because of it.",Recommended
Gives me nostalgia from the good 'ol PS2 days. Still one of the best survival horror games out there.,Recommended
"Resident Evil 4 was the best in the series, and the last ""good"" Resident Evil (imo). I've loved it since I was a kid, and am glad it's on Steam.\n\nI just wish Capcom would stop ""remastering"" it for ""new consoles"", because this was supposed to be the last re-release.",Recommended

"The overhaul that Resident Evil needed, RE4 is a classic game not jusyt of the survival horror genre, but of action games, in general. Almost a herald of what the next-gen shooters would become, every aspect of Resident Evil was improved with this game: visual style, tighter controls, a much-needed improvement to inventory, and it's own twist on the RE story that remains connected, but all it's own. The plethora of bonus features means hours upon hours of replayability, including bonus weapons, costumes, and fifficulties to the main game, not to mention two separate Ada missions, and the highly-applauded Mercenaries mode. A game that I have owned six times now - seven once I get my Ps3 hooked up again - I recommend this to any action-oriented, Resident Evil, or any fans of games that push concepts and innovation of it's time.",Recommended

"[b]Quick Breakdown:[/b] A remastered version of Capcom’s 2005 horror classic. At times a slow paced survival game, punctuated with bursts of more frenetic third person shooter action.\n[b]Length:[/b] 20-25 (Main game), 30+ (Main + extras)\n[b]Genre:[/b] Survival Horror / Third Person Shooter / Action\n[b]Score:[/b] 8.5/10\n[b]Review Date:[/b] 2016-07-04\n\n[b]Full Review:[/b] Having not initially played this game until almost a decade after its release, it’s more difficult for me to fully grasp the impact it originally had on the industry, and while I’d love to go in depth with that, I’m just not familiar enough with those details. Instead we’ll focus on what we have here, which is a game that is still fantastic to play, even for the first time.\n\nYou play as Leon Kennedy, as US government agent sent to rescue the President’s daughter from a crazed cult in Spain. While doing so, he uncovers a more sinister plot involving a mind controlling parasite known as Las Plagas. It’s a pretty decent story, and more than enough to keep things interesting.\n\nOn to the meat of RE4: the gameplay, and it’s solid. The controls are a little bit dated, utilizing tank controls, in which your character turns left and right instead of strafing, and the mouse aims without changing the camera angle. It took some getting used to, but probably 2 or 3 hours of gameplay, but it was worth it in the end. While I certainly prefer more modern controls, they at least works for the game.\n\nThe game starts off very slow paced, very much a survival horror game in its early stages, having to scrounge around for weapons, health, and ammo, and just barely managing to scrap by. Resources eventually become a more easily manageable thing in the later game, once it transitions to be more action heavy. That’s not to say you can ever stop worrying and just coast without thinking of supplies, especially since you have to play inventory tetris. You have a limited amount of carrying space, represented by a grid, which each item taking up one or more grid spaces, and in various shapes representing the item itself. It’s not the perfect system, and it has its drawbacks, but at the same time it has a charm to it that does add a unique element to the game, while managing to benefit the survival element of the game.\n\nThe game has a good horror atmosphere, featuring unsettling environments, and a host of interesting enemies, from crazed villagers, horrible beasts, parasitic lifeforms, and religious fanatics. The bosses in the game are massive, colossal behemoths, grotesquely deformed parasites, and a hell of a lot of fun to fight.\n\nSome of the game seems to draw a lot of inspiration from John Carpenter’s [i]The Thing[/i], which given that it’s one of my favourite movies ever, is certainly a good thing. This can be seen in some of the enemies (Las Plagas seems to borrow some inspiration), and especially a level in the later part of the game set in a frozen laboratory (which also calls to mind the original [i]The Thing From Another World[/i] from 1951). Possibly I’m drawing more connections between the two given that I greatly enjoy each, but it’s nonetheless something that I can’t help but notice and chalk up as a positive.\n\nIf there’s any downside to the gameplay that jumps out, it’s the quick time events, which add little-to-nothing, and are sometimes frustrating. There’s even a QTE or two where some people had to turn down their graphic settings, else they’re impossible to pass. I don’t remember if I personally had this problem, but I know my brother did, and he played on a machine similar to mine. For reference, one of them was the QTE at the end of an action filled mine cart passage (which in itself was a lot of fun), but the QTE involved rapid button mashing.\n\nThe game itself looks beautiful, the remastered graphics manage to really bring out the environments and enemies. I haven’t played any of the previous versions of the game, but from what I’ve read poking around online, this is the best version to play if you’re new to the game. If you’ve already played the game before, there’s no need to play through this again just because it’s been remastered, unless of course you simply want to play it again since it’s a great game. (Something I myself intend to do at some point).\n\nThe main game itself will take you around 20 or so hours to finish the main campaign; though I think I took a bit longer than that myself, adjusting to the controls, and exploring everything. (Not that I got 100% or anything). There are a few bonuses that you manage to unlock by finishing the campaign, a pair of mini-campaigns where you play as Ada Wong, which will take about an hour or two each, and are a fun romp.\n\nThere’s also a mini-game, called The Mercenaries, in which you can play as 5 different characters (4 of which must be unlocked), and your aim is to earn as high a score as possible before the time runs out. Points are earned by killing enemies, with combos and boss enemies rewarding more points. It’ll help kill at least an hour or so just dicking around, and it’s decent fun.\n\nIf you’re a fan of horror games, especially survival horror mixed with action, this is a must play. Otherwise, it might not do much for you, but it’s worth at least a try if it piques your interest.",Recommended
"The reason I like the Resident Evil games are mostly because I have a partner to protect me, since I am scared shitless of creep crawlers BOWS.

Very fun and atmospheric game. RE4 is like RE5 without the complete over the top ridiculousness and more emphasis on survival and realism (slightly). The slow paced third person shooter gameplay where you have to make every shot count is addicting even if some enemies can be cheap with instakill grab type moves.

Framerates do make a difference, people!\n\nIF you are one of those who never played RE4, well it's one of the most influental games of its generation and you can still see the effect it's had on 3rd person shooters today.

The ""modern"" control setting is greatly appreciated and makes aiming with a mouse very enjoyable. The only flaw I could find happens during the fight with Del Lago. The aiming reticle is so sensitive that it's nearly unplayable. Turning the aiming mode back to classic and turning the sensitivity all the way down did nothing to help. I've played nearly every version of the game and have never encountered this problem. Other than that, the game runs wonderfully and has never looked better.",Recommended

"Resident Evil 4 was an instant classic when it came out, and I have to say, it still holds that title to this day. You could really tell the developers cared about making this game and did their best to make it as best as they could.\n\nThis game is jampacked with memorable moments, characters, and hilariously intentional cheesy one liners from our main character, Leon. This game's story captivates all the cheesy cliches from any hollywood action movie, and uses them to their advantage by its self-awarness.\n\nThat's not to say this game isn't serious or scary, though. Time and time again this game will throw the most depraved, disgusting monsters at you and when you think it's given you its worst it just keeps on surprising you. And the way they present this is what makes it so effective.\n\nIn the first half of the game, you'll be fighting regular, infected villagers.

"So residnet evil 4 is likely one of my most replayed games and one of my favorite games of all time.\n\nI've beaten this game dozens of  times and i still keep coming back to it.  This was lightning in a bottle for Capcom.  This is  the game that invented the 3rd person action horror shooter and after 15 years this game still holds up amazingly.\n\nIf you never played any of the other Resident Evil Games then no worries as this game is hardly related to the plot of any of them.  You Play Sercert Agent Leon and your trying to rescue the presidents daughter from an insain spanish cult.  Pure camp gold.\n\nThe game is mostly about resouce management and crowd control.  Your almost always surrounded in this game and you have to make good use of your items and ammo.  The enemies are relentless and surprisingly smart at times given how old t he game is.  There are tons of nice little game play touches like shooting an enemy in the face or knee to stun them and give you a window to do a contextual attack on them.   \n\nAnd this game did what no other game before it had pulled off.  It made an escort mission fun!  You actually find the President's daughter fairly early in the game and you spend a good part of it escorting her around trying to keep her safe.  But thanks to some clever AI choices (She always follows close behind you unless you tell her to wait.  She Ducks when you point a weapon her way.) it doesn't feel like a chore.  Its a fun challenge.\n\nAs for the horror elements, this game is scary but in a different way then resident evil games before it.  most of the scare factor comes from always being surrouned or not paying attention and being blind sided.  there are some geniuenly scary moments but most of the game is about becoming more and more tense as your enemies draw in close around you.  \n\nThe graphics hold up pretty well for a Game Cube port and i didn't notice any huge issues with the PC version other than rarely your character couldn't raise his weapon if Ashley was positioned a certain way between you and certian objects (only happend like 2 or 3 times) and there is a little slow down in certain areas mostly when you begin a location.  I never really noticed it in combat.\n\nBest of all this is a long game.  The Main Quest can easily last you 15 to 20 hours  and has tons of unlockables in the form of new game plus, super weapons, alternate outfits a couple of side story quests for secondary character Ada Wong and a horde mode.\n\nThis is a great Game.  If you haven't played it do so now.  Forget Resident Evil 5 and 6, just play this one.",Recommended
"I played completed RE5 multiple times alone and with friends before this on xbox, and I really enjoyed it. played this for 5 minutes and I LOVED it.\n\nThe game is very enjoyable, the merchant is a fun character, the survival horror aspect is interesting.

"TL;DR, Config.ini is your friend if you have a low-end computer. Scroll down for my configuration.\n\nI got this game knowing the risks: I have a laptop not optimized for gaming (Macbook Pro 15"", mid-2011). I read the reviews; I knew what I was getting myself into. The lag was destined to be prominent, and the syncing unforgivable.\n\nKnowing the risks, I still went full steam (haha) ahead with the purchase and download. Low and behold, the game ran like butt. I refused to write a negative review deriding the game because of these issues. It would have been my own damn fault for buying it knowing the risks, anyway.  Instead, I sought to fix the problem, and I believe I have.\n\nFull disclosure: even though I have an old laptop, I installed 16GB of RAM years ago. That was a step in the right direction. I have had the logicboard and harddrive placed numerous times. When my fourth HDD crashed (I blame it on the Bootcamp and KotOR, but I am reckless with my computer), I installed a SDD. I do not know what sort of impact SDDs have on game performance (I assumed minimal), but it counts as some sort of upgrade. What I am trying to say, is that if you have a laptop that is on the low-end, without certain modifications, I do not know if I can recommend this game. I got lucky with my laptop, and I am still not wholly sure why.\n\nOn to the solution. As noted earlier, the game ran like butt on even the lowest in-game settings (30FPS is your friend, otherwise, you should know that most settings need to be turned all the way down or completely off to optimize performance; that's just the way it is). I had to go directly to the game files, and in particular, a piece of text named config.ini, to make some edits. Here is what I have:\n\nresolution 1280 800 60\nvsync 1\nfullscreen 0\nadapter 0\nantialiasing 0\nanisotropy 0\nshadowQuality 0\nuseHDTexture 0\nppEnabled 0\nmotionblurEnabled 0\nvariableframerate 30\nsubtitle 0\nlaserR 255\nlaserG 0\nlaserB 0\nlaserA -1\n\nI thought I had set VSYNC to 0, but whatever. Change it if it doesn't work. This is what finally made the game run for me. I have the game in windowed mode, because full screen mode simply is unforgiving for performance.\n\nWith this set-up on my non-gaming laptop, it works fine. I love it. I have only played for a little bit, as you can see, but so far, it is alright.\n\nHowever, I still do not know if I can recommend this game fully. This is advertised as an HD remake; I cannot judge this game based off of graphics. It looks worse than my old Gamecube version because my laptop absolutely cannot handle higher resolutions. For those of those looking for sweet graphics, I am not sure what to tell you, other than I hope it looks good and plays well on your end. I believe it when I see some people distressing over performance even when they have high-powered computers. That's just how technology can be sometimes. I heard RE4 PC ports have suffered, but I cannot say much about that in terms of experience.\n\nI can recommend it because it is RE4, a game I loved as a kid, and still as an adult. I am excited to play it on a new platform. I am not proficient with keyboard controls just yet, even with hours of ""practice"" in KotOR. Nevertheless, it feels fluid enough. This is a rock solid game; always has been, always will be.\n\nOther than that, there is not much else to say. Please be cautious with your purchase. If you do buy it and you own a low-end laptop, then proceed at your own risk. Be ready to do some work to make the game run for you. I know full well that the lag might be coming for me, and if it does, it was my own fault.",Recommended

"The best resident evil game and one of my favourite games of all time. It’s one of those games that I can never get tired of replaying. The story is gripping and the characters are likeable. The variation in the locations and level design is outstanding. There are so many sequences and stand out moments that you will never forget because they are so well done. There is never a dull moment you are always doing something different. The game is not scary but it is very suspenseful, especially when there are dozens of enemies surrounding you. The game keeps escalating the more you play it and it never takes a break. The boss fights are fun and memorable. The shooting is addictive as well as customizing and unlocking new weapons. I can’t praise it enough. \n10/10 (Masterpiece)",Recommended
"The year was, if I recall right, 2003. I was still pretty young at the time, my sole experience with Resident Evil being this one time I'd tricked my parents into letting me rent Resident Evil 3 for the PS1. My family was poor, and this was the sole mechanism by which I could play games.\n\nNow, a few years earlier, the PS2 had come out, and I *really* wanted one. The list price was too much for my parents to bear, and instead, I continued playing that PS1 for long enough that no new games were actually coming out. I actually read a lot of books instead. Then, in 2003, I conned one of them into getting me a PS2. They ****ed up and I got a Gamecube for Christmas instead.\n\nAt the time I was rather irritated, and proceeded to try and hate the box my mom had purchased me, because I was a little s*** like most early teenagers. It came with a few pack-in games - I forget most of them by now - but one was Super Mario Sunshine. It was mediocre but looked nice. I soon realized most of the available Gamecube games were far nicer visually than the PS2, and decided to combat my poor-ness by flaunting what I had, so to speak. I believe this is how most modern rappers make it big. In that respect, I attempted to become the 50 Cent of white gamers.\n\nProblem: the Gamecube had a reputation at my school for being a ""kiddy"" console with ""lame"" games and a distinct lack of Grand Theft Auto. I was very, very upset by this, because like most 90s-00s kids, I wanted to be perceived as cool. And cool in those mewling days meant ""having a game with more bloodshed than the news is permitted to show"". Since the news had allowed footage of mass suicide by that point, I was thoroughly ****ed.\n\nI loved the Gamecube in the end, don't get me wrong. I even, by the end of that console gen, managed to buy all three machines. But the Gamecube had the most consistently good first-party titles. Alas, quality of games be damned, Metroid Prime was the closest thing to a ""cool"" game my beloved box had.\n\nNow, you might notice I've spent 400 words or so distinctly NOT talking about RE4 in this review of RE4. That's because RE4 wound up being a Gamecube exclusive for a time, and everyone basically loved it the moment it came out. But - more critically in my case - it was the first game with extremely detailed locational damage that I had ever seen. Because I was the only one among my friends to own a Gamecube, they had to briefly eat their words and admit that I had something neat they couldn't. That felt nice for a change.\n\nGood news is, RE4 doesn't ride on nostalgia OR the bizarre cultural obsessions of the time I was young. It still plays unlike anything else. It's still moronically paced. It's like living a horror movie as directed by Tommy Wiseau.\n\nThere is a boss character that is literally a midget stereotype of a Spanish castellan.\n\nThere is the line ""No Thanks Bro"" uttered without a hint of irony.\n\nThe thing is, it also has bizarrely satisfying combat and just the right level of cringe to be unashamedly brilliant.\n\nI don't really need to harp on why RE4 is good, history's done that for me. This is a reasonable port. It's visually dated but runs fine.\n\nBasically, I'm encouraging you to drop $7 on a piece of anti-art this summer sale and enjoy the sort of thing a teenager would use to desperately hide his parents' lack of wealth from his violence-obsessed, moronic friends.\n\nThe worst part is when I finally managed to play GTA, I found I just didn't ""get"" it.\n\nRE4 is way better than my childhood is what I'm really trying to say.",Recommended

I'm glad I did, because even after all these years I very much enjoyed this game. The controls take some time getting used to, but when you do, it all feels really smooth. Genuinly scary and tense at times, this game is really fun with cool character and a plot that doesn't take itself too serious. Game runs good with no crashes. Recommended!",Recommended
What can i say about this game... first of allw hat i played \n\n.Played on easy mode started on normal may do professional haven't decided yet. \n\n.All blue coins collected most of the treasure collected i missed like 1 or 2 things due to the fact that i didn't know areas became inacesseble after a certain plot point. \n\n.Played some of the extra missions with ada (she is bad a** btw)\n\nScare factor in this game is next to minimal it has a few jump scares but thats about it ... im looking at you guy in the furnace. :/  It is still worth playing though the only parts i wasn't fond of was with ashley  the fact that you can shoot her and kill her your self nakes things hard. \n\nShe sometimes gets in your way and you just end up wanting to kill her anyways. ;)  Thankfully the parts without her make up fo that. \n\nExploration is key in this game explore evry part of the map there could be treasure worth a lot of money and or much needed ammo. Speaking of ammo if you can avoid a lot of the stuff or knife things down you will want that ammo during boss fights and other stronger enemies. try not to use healing herbs and or sprays much you can pick up chicken eggs and stuff like that to help you heal. \n\nI have not played a resident evil game since nemesis (a long time ago)  I have fond memories of that game being scary. I was expecting to get scared around almost every corner of this game but sadly it did not happen as i said already it only has a few jump scares and when you know they re there it becomes not scary anymore. So the scare factor to this game runs off quick.   \n\n \n\n\nIt was still a decent game though so if you haven't played one of these in awhile it is worth picking up. Lot's of replay value as well.,Recommended

"I reccomend resident evil 4 always, but i would not call this version a ""remaster"".. This version is nothing more than a controller support patch. In fact this gives remasters in general a bad name.\n\nAs a game in general this version is fine. It works and it supports my wireless xb1 controller natively. But i think they could have put more effort into actually remastering it. There are maybe like.. 5 new textures amongst the thousands of original textures. And the new textures just look odd in comparison to the SD textures around them. \n\nOf all the game remasters ive seen to date, the first worst i would say was state of decay (cant find a single enhancement even if you inspect it with magnifying glass) followed by darksiders DE, then sleeping dogs DE, then this.\n\nIn my mind using a word as powerful as ""remaster"" would entail 100% replaced textures, updated renderer, new lighting, new graphic effects, 64 bit support, dx11 support etc..\n\nI was able to use reshade to inject SSAO and lumasharpen to sharpen up this version of the game (this version is very blurry for some reason)\n\nBut if you had to play any version, id say this version was microscopicly better so i reccomend this version",Recommended

"Resident Evil 4 is a classic and it's a must buy if you haven't played it yet. The basic premise is very simple, you play as Leon S. Kennedy a U.S agent who is out to rescue the president's daughter. This simple premise evolves into something much bigger with secret cults and mind controlling parasites.\n\nHowever not everything is perfect. The controls are bad and you'd be better off playing with a controller. There are also some technical problems but to condense this review I'll just list out the PRO's and the CON's:\n\nPRO's:\n1. Great story\n2. Some genuinely terrifying moments\n3. Great characters and boss fights\n4. Creepy atmosphere\n5. The merchant\n6. The amount of content\n7. Everything that's not a con basically\n\nCON's:\n1. Inventory system is outdated\n2. Some muddy textures stand out from the usual HD textures\n3. AI acts dumb some times\n4. Technical problems  (play on 30 fps until you reach Chapter 5-1 because you'll have a hard time during one part if you don't)\n5. Some cutscenes don't have the HD makeover\n6. Crappy PC controls\n\nOverall RE4 is a great game and most of the CON's are just me nitpicking. If you enjoy action based, survival horror games, RE4 is for you.",Recommended
"If you haven't played Resident Evil 4, than there must be something wrong with you. Resident Evil 4 is one of the best games ever made. Playing as Resident Evil 2 survivor Leon S. Kennedy, you go into a remote Spanish village and wind up rescuing the presidents daughter. Involving more action that previous entries, the ""horror"" elements come more from the terrifying enemies and the myriad ways they can end Mr. Kennedy's life.\n\nMore action, more enemies, more guns, more ammo, more health items. This game offers more and more and more than previous entries and is a must play for anyone who enjoys action shooters, survival horror, or is a fan of the series.",Recommended

The controls are what they should be for a horror game not like Resident of Duty 6.\n\nI bought this version because the first PC version didn't have lighting effects, fog and has a really bad UI and settings (aside from my DVD breaking y.y) , and it really makes a difference but on the downside I had to go into the ini files to change the controllers because I am used to the Gamecube Layout (Even in the first PC port you could change all the buttons) and to disable Vsync. This port is not optimized but it isn't that insulting. Still worth it in my opinion because the game is amazing.",Recommended

"Save your money. It's unplayable.\n\nI played Resident Evil 1/2 (and I think 3) on the Playstation years ago, and loved them.\n\nI expected ham acting. I expected a crap script. I expected a plot full of holes. I expected dated graphics. It delivers on all of those, but then that's part of Resident Evil's charm, right? However, I also expected to have fun.\n\nI picked this game up as part of a bundle thinking it would be good to revisit the series. I was kind of expecting it to be showing its age (and, yes, it is), but what I wasn't quite expecting was that it would be UTTERLY unplayable.\n\nI've tried it with keyboard and mouse, and it's unplayable.  The keyboard rotates the character, mouse moves the camera. When you hit forward or backwards, you move where the character is facing, not where the camera is facing. I was getting motion sick within seconds. When you click to aim, the mouse then moves REALLY slowly (even with the sensitivity turned up high), so it's REALLY hard to correctly aim while being attacked.\n\nSo I tried the Steam Controller. A bit better, but really not much.\n\nThe lack of being able to sidestep etc just makes this too painful to be worth playing through. Oh, and you can't aim and move at the same time, so no backing away from oncoming zombies.\n\nI know that the style of movement was probably part of the games character to start with, but MY GOD, it's painful.\n\nThe ""Remastered"" nature of this game made me think that stuff like this would have been tweaked, but alas, no.\n",Not Recommended

The gameplay is insanely fun, the puzzles, while maybe not the most challenging in the world, certainly add a sense of variety and a break in the action.

Their is even a way to play Ada on various missions.\n\nI tried out the other extra mini games and wasn't a fan. You just have to keep killing people and finding hour glasses to increase your time.

"Resident Evil 4 is not worth your time.\n\nTo describe RE4 in three words: Uninspiring, clunky, mediocre\n\nRE4 was met with critical acclaim when initially released in 2005 and is also considered by many critics as a pinnacle of achievment within its genre. While RE4 has some good things going for it, it simply does not hold up well when compared to its predecessors. \nWhen comparing RE4 to its competition, RE4 is simply not worth your time; I will walk through why RE4 does not quite deserve the acclaim it has garnered. \n\nThe good:\n\n+ The new HD textures are nice from the update\n+ Huge environments with hidden treasures and some cool puzzles. Great for players who enjoy exploration.\n+ Innovative and creative enemies \n\nThe bad:\n\n- The controls are simply horrendous. You cannot move while aiming your gun. You cannot strafe. When you turn while aiming, it takes an obscene amount of time. I understand the goal of this is the aptly named ""tank controls"" (really slow and it ""creates suspense""), but the problem is it doesn't make the game feel smooth. In fact it makes the combat feel choppy and interrupted. Essentially, the movement is clunky and it does not flow well. When you get backed into a wall the camera can mess you up really bad and it becomes difficult to control Leon. The controls are by far the biggest detriment to this game. And the controls are bad. Real bad.\n\n- The inventory and weapon swapping. You canNOT swap weapons through a wheel - you must OPEN THE MENU AND MANUALLY SELECT any item you wish to use. Limited resource space is fine. You can't have infinite stuff and it forces you make choices. Good. But going into your inventory screen simply to swap weapons? Are you serious? Opening up the menu, swap to a shotgun, shoot a few times, open the menu again, switch to a grenade, use the grenade, open the menu AGAIN, swap to a pistol, - get the idea? Frustrating, tedious, and does not flow well. This was fine for the first Resident Evil (1996) - but RE4 was released in 2005. Having a weapon swap like this from a 2005 title is unforgivable.\n\n- You do not have the option of playing in first person - third person only. I understand RE is a third person franchise, but I don't see the hurt in givng the player the option of using first person. I only mention this because the camera messes up so bad in third person when you are near walls. This wouldn't be an issue in first person.\n\n- Controling Ashley is annoying although it isn't a super big deal if you use your Z commands correctly. Still, why did the developers create scenarios where you have to babysit. It doesn't make sense for this genre. \n\n- The actual storlyine is borderline acceptable at best. It doesn't create much suspense and there is zero character development. Good characters make good stories. That doesn't exist here.\n\n- The voice acting and the dialogue between the characters is super cheesy and made me want to vomit. \n\nIn summary:  The controls suck, the inventory system is outdated (even in 2005 it was outdated), and the storyline/characters are cringeworthy.\n\n\nComparisons to other shooters from its time and its predecessors: \n\n- Resident Evil (1996) - Arguably one of the most important titles in gaming history - characters and dialogue were a bit cheesy here as well but it's easy to look past this; nonetheless, innovative and inspired the industry.\n- Half Life (1998) -  A superior title in gameplay, story, and controls.\n- Unreal (1998)  - A superior title in both gameplay and controls although its story is lacking.\n- System Shock 2 (1999) - A superior title in  gameplay, story, and controls.\n- Deus Ex (2000) - A superior title in  gameplay, story, and controls.\n\nTake for example Half Life. Widely considered one of the best games of all time. It came out in 1998. SEVEN years before RE4. Still, in 2005, RE4 continues to use an outdated inventory system and movement and controls which are beyond comprehensible. How is this even possible? RE4 simply does not deserve the praise it has received. \n\nIn a vacuum, RE4 is a decent game. If the controls and weapon swapping were better, it would still be mediocre due to a boring story and horrible characterization. Take a step back and compare RE4 to its competitors - it simply does not hold up. There are many other titles that do what RE4 does much better and that is why RE4 is not worth your time.\n\n6.0/10",Not Recommended

I've played this game through on 4 different systems now including computer. I enjoyed the pc version and I played this through using an Xbox 360 controller so I cannot comment on the keyboard/mouse controls but if you're an avid fan of the game like I am and have a contoller or are willing to try the keyboard/mouse  then pick this gem up and play it through again!\n\nPS: I had no issues with any crashes or glitches the game ran flawlessly.,Recommended
"keyboard controls are terrible so don't get this unless you have a controller, it's compatability is questionable at best and it's much choppier and slower than consol version by far, if you're looking to play or replay this game on PC don't even bother it's a waste",Not Recommended

"Unfortunately this isn't a very good port. You can turn on antialiasing, which is nice, but the game is definitely showing its age. It could have really used some more graphical options. I expect that doubly so since this is the second release on PC, so you'd think they would have taken a bit more care when it's supposed to be fixing what was wrong with the first version.\n\n I ran into a game breaking bug late in the game which made a quicktime event impossible to complete. After a lengthy amount of gameplay including an on-rails minecart section you have to mash a button to climb up a ledge and it simply doesn't work. Supposedly you can work around it by setting the game to run at 30 FPS but honestly I was a bit fed up by this point. I would suggest buying a console version of RE4 - this one is definitely not up to snuff. I suggest the Wii version if that's an option for you.\n\nPostivite things: \nThis version does include all the extras. You've got the Ada-specific modes and the unlockable super-weapons like the plaga laser.\nWorked fine with a 360 controller.\nIt's supposedly better than the first RE4 PC port. Being better than total crap apparently means ""still crap,"" though. :(",Not Recommended

While the game itself deserves 5 stars everything else deserves 0. I played this game on gamecube and it was my favourite Resident Evil game. This game caused a revolution in gaming history. They were first to make a successful 3rd person shoulder shooter. Without them Gears of War would be first person. But the pc version is terrible its a time and money waster. 50.0% of the pc versions dont work even if you beat the recommended specs 10 times over. The reason that the recommended rating is so high is because capcom deletes many of negative review/comments on the game. To top it off they refuse to fix the problem even if you pay top dollar for the game. They also refuse to reply to emails. If they dont reply within the 15 days allowed for returns on steam they get your money and your stuck with nothing. So altogether i recommend this for consoles only.,Not Recommended
"     From playing it on playstation 2 (Mind you its not too bad...) and then onto playing it on the wii which is probably the best version of it, anywho the game overall is a good port with its 60fps goodness  and a choice of HD or SD although a issue is not having an xbox controller handy so you have to get used to the keyboard and mouse which is difficult and will take a few hours to adjust. All in all, i would recomend the game only if its on sale which i did because of the low price.",Recommended

"I love this game! So much nostalgia..I played this game when it first came out, and playing it over again, it has stood up to the test of time. It's not perfect, but I do think this is a must try for anyone..Though the controls don't translate well to PC, and most people have to turn the graphics down to cut back on slow down, it's still a fun game. The ""HD"" graphics aren't amazing, even with all the settings up, but personally I don't care about that. There are mods to fix that, I think anyway..Oh, and I know it's not really a good thing, but for players who aren't the greatest at this sort of thing, considering the way you aim..a bit of slowdown can help a bit, if you don't mind being slightly slugish. Anyway, the point of all this is that Resident Evil 4 is an amazing game. Maybe even the best, though Resident Evil 1 was pretty good too..The only thing I think that could surpass this would be RE7..check that out too if you have yet to see it. [Oh, and if you have the option, the port on the Wii is the best out of all the ports, in my opinion anyway..The aiming is much easier in that one]",Recommended

"So I wanted to make this review a two or more part review. My first impressions and then later my overall opinion on the game. If you are reading this early on then you will only see my first impressions as im going to put more hours in before making part 2. Most of us purchasing this game have played it in the past. So to discuss its epic gameplay and cult following would likely leave me sounding like a broken record amongst other reviewers here. However like many here, I played this game years ago on gamecube and then had it for the Wii later on. It is in my opinion; one of the best games ever made. That along with Far Cry Instincts however im referring to the xbox version, I understand that the pc port seems to be different. Anyways back to Resident Evil. The only concerns are these, for starters we have the difficulty. This is a difficult game, this may not be a game for your twitch button smashing COD player, but more for your Skyrim player. You will need to be somewhat tactical regardless of what approach you take. The enemies usually require headshots and ammo is scarce. So walking in to the center of the crowd and firing off alot of rounds is going to maybe kill 2 enemies and the other 10 will no doubt slaughter you. The other concern is the only thing id call a drawback. The controlls are not good, I found its a little easier using an xbox one controller however I think it really just comes down to personal preference. They are clunky, its hard to aim as well as look around. When you pair this up with the difficulty of this game your walking into some dangerous waters. However you seem to learn to get used to the controlls and they become functional. As of right now I see the issue to be nothing more than a beginning of game issue. When I get part 2 released I will have a deffinite answer for you. So is this game worth the money? Yes it is. Would I reccomend you get it? Yes if you enjoy games like Skyrim, 7 days to die or have played this game in the past.\nSMALL UPDATE:\nSo this is not a deal breaker by any means. However I have discovered some odd performance issues that should not exist in a game this old on a pc as beefy as mine. Often times when in fog and with numerous enemies around the game slows down... Not really a noticable frame drop (picture is still smooth). It is more like everything is in some form of slow motion. Very odd and more likely than not something that the developers need to fix. This is the only real problem I have had!",Recommended

I played this game when it came out on GameCube and I played through it again on PC for the nostalgia. This game is wonderfull. Resident Evil 4 is definitely the best one in the series. Ignore these petty negative reviews. This game is just as good as you remember it being.,Recommended
"16/6/16\n_______________\n\nSo I gave the game another run since why not I spent my time to download it, the first part of this review was my first impression of the game, and even tho I dont meet recommended settings, minimum means it can still run (aimed of course), and yeah the port should really be ran at 60 fps to give it a much smoother experience.\n\nNow onto my over all review, the game it self is good, I'd recommend getting it if you like the franchise (since this is the one that changed the ""survival horror"" this franchise use to be) however be warned the game is more better off being played with a controller, with keyboard and mouse (excluding the mouse really) the controls feel almost clunky, this is why I'd recommend using a controller (even tho you can change the key bindings its still better off with one).\n\nAfter looking further into it, I've decided to give it a thumbs up review, as the game itself is an amazing creation that made me love the Resident evil franchise as a whole, while as my first impressions was negative.  But then again don't let 1 persons review determin if you want this game or not.\n\n\n15/6/16\n_______________\nI use to play this on the PS2 when it came out on it I loved the game completely, it felt so smooth and a hell of a lot easier to paly the game than it is on the PC.\n\nSo Just to say my specs meet the minimum PC specs so I ran the game according to what I could, however when playing on the PC version of this, it feels severly clunky and no smooth transition between running and shooting, and honestly personally this feels like its not very well optimized for the PC port.",Recommended

It was refreshing to visit this game now that I have gotten better at gaming. One major gripe I have with this PC port is the controls. Maybe it's just me but it takes a fortnight just to turn around and I tried playing it with my not Xbox controller for windows and it is ABYSMAL! So I played with just my keyboard and mouse and it was less trash, but still kind of trash. But in the end the controls didn't hinder the gameplay too much and I was still able to relive the glory days before I hated my life. So yeah definitely recommend!

Its a pretty good game.\nI dont think that its as good as some people say but then again resident evil never was one of my favourite franchises.\nSome people love it and say its the best game in the series.\nSome people hate it because of what came after it.\nI really liked how they jumped to over the shoulder yet still sustained that horror feel.\nI thought that maybe they should have lowered the weapons down a bit like remove the rocket launcher because it made it a bit too actiony sometimes. The game also has action scenes similar to 5 which were not in the original games and these scenes really take the horror out of the eqaution sometimes.\nThe story isnt really that memorable or great IMO but its OK.\n8/10\n\n\n[h1]I intend to re-review this game once I play it again because I feel that my current review is lacking and doesn't agree with my current opinion.

Luckily i had an Xbox controller plugged in that allowed me to just swap back and forth, but for some users that could literally be game breaking.  You can google about them if you want, trying not to spoil anything.  I also crashed once, but i have read other users having problems with it.

"Let me start off by saying Resident Evil 4 is a great game. I've been playing Resident Evil since the 2nd game and I have to say they really rebooted the franchise in a amazing way with this title. \n\nFrom the controls to the gameplay everything seemed to come together.  With all that being said I have to caution you about this HD version of the game as I ran into some issues that soured my gaming experience a bit with this title. \n\nThe most jarring complaint I have with this game was the sudden drop in frame rate during certain moments. It's hard for me to believe that a game this old despite the HD update could not maintain a constant 60fps when certain particle effects like rain or a large amount of characters were on screen at one time. It even effected one of the boss battles something that could have easily taken me out of the game if it ultimately deterred my ability to move forward. \n\nMy second complaint was the controller support. While the game did detect all of my buttons there were some weird moments during quick time events where they would not register. \n\nThere was one point during the game that I basically had to use the mouse and keyboard just to get to the next area and unfortunately once I switched,  my controller was no longer responsive and I had to use the alternative until I could find a save point..not the best time with that.  \n \nWith these two issues paying for the game at the full price would have felt like a mistake. Lucky for me I grabbed this during a humble bundle sale. \n\nI'm giving this a recommendation because despite some of the bad experiences, this is a good game and you should play it. I just want to make people aware there may be some issues.",Recommended

"Truly the perfect video game. A timeless masterpiece that can be enjoyed by any generation.\n\nStory, dialogue, cheesiness, humour, pacing, enemies, bosses, NPC characters, gameplay, gunplay, locations, inventory management UI, minigames, weapon upgrade customization, escort missions, secrets, puzzles, extra story content, minigames, the mercenaries mode - everything about those is beyond perfection.\n\nHD textures are way less blurry and far better, also this port is well optimized and contains all additional content. It supports 60 FPS and the only issue I had is lower framerate during few cutscenes for few seconds when running anti-aliasing at max.\n\nBut ofc there must be that one bad thing about the game that I cannot hide and that is a ""professional mode"" aka ""hard difficulty"".\nOverall for a person who did finish this game at least once it should not be a big issue to play it on hard.... for majority of game. Increase of health and damage done by enemies would be just enough for hard mode in this, right? Well - wrong, because thats not enough according to developers.\nEnemies far more agressive, attacking, shooting and grabbing you way faster making it way harder to dodge ranged enemies, especially when you want to shoot them or when you have entire group in front of you beside people with crossbow. Also you have way less time for Quick Time Events, often a half second to react and more often they are RANDOMIZED and instant kills will happen way more ofter. \nDespite all that - its not a big deal as I say for majority of game, because rooms doesn't have that many enemies and checkpoints are happening every room.\nWell, except for like 10 rooms in the game, instant killing bosses and EVERYTHING after killing boss [spoiler] Krauser [/spoiler] where all those problems on ""professional"" spikes even highter to the point of frustration, because they contain like 40 enemies that may spawn everywhere. Especially during ""helicopter section"" where developers had an amazing idea to make game even harder by helicopter refusing to help you on ""professional"" for 10 minutes longer. How many times ""helicopter"" can help you in that section? 4 times. If you die at any point you need to start whole room from the beginning.\n\nI did love this game years ago and I still love it but last hours on ""professional"" mode got me really angry at my beloved game, especially because its easy to see that Resident Evil 4 was designed around ""normal"" difficulty and with ""professional"" mode developers clearly was like ""F*ck, lets make it super annoying guys because death every 15 minutes is fun and instant kills are fair and challenging. Oh, harder QTE's.

"[h1] The Short of It[/h1]\nI didn't like it. While historically significant to the early 2000 period of game design and culture, it doesn't seem to hold up any longer under the harsh glare of ten years of progress and trend. Not a bad game per se, but no longer deserving of the praise it still regularly recieves. \n\n\n[h1] The Long of It[/h1]\nWe finished Resident Evil 4 just a day before this writing. We'd started it because I had always wanted to play it, but couldn't get around the tank controls when I was younger and was also a giant wuss. \n\nNow I'm older, it's not really scary anymore, and I've figured out tank controls. Turns out, I just don't like Resident Evil.\n\nIt's got its strong points; the opening in the village was a great tone setter, the controls are actually pretty reasonable once you figure them out, and knowing what era this comes from, I was happy to have never really fought with the camera once. Aesthetically it's aged pretty well and it's visual themes are all pretty well developed and cohesive. Sound design, as well, deserves high praise; every bit of ambiance was a note of what was hiding around the corner and the music, when applied, was superlatively oppressive, foreboding, and gothic in the classical sense. I can see why this game gets so lauded; the bones of older Resident Evil games have been cut from the fat, and rehoused in a sleeker, better-designed chassis. Gunplay is more responsive and meaningful, it's no longer about how many shots you put into them, but where, and the upgrade system makes sure you've always got something useful to dump your pasetas into. \n\nBut...it's a slog. Not just slowly paced, but actively slowing you down, and then going on for a bit longer than it probably should. There's a boss fight, specifically, at the end of the Castle section where it feels like the game [i] should[/i] have ended, like that was where it was [i] meant[/i] to have ended, but no, there's a whole additional area to go through. At this point, I've had my thrills, I've fought the antagonist, and I'm ready to move on. But no, there's more game. From that point onward, it became increasingly difficult to care.\n\nI found myself also kind of bogged down by the inventory. Most modern horror games have done away with things like resource management outside of a scant one or two things (flashlight batteries, lamp oil, so on) and having played this now, I think that's mostly the right decision. Knowing I only had 9 shotgun shells left didn't enhance my sense of dread, it just made me sort of annoyed and anxious; ""Well, shit, looks like I'm fighting the next room with Pistols in case something big comes along,"" I would think. It allowed me to make strategic decisions, yes; weighing cost and risk on an uncertain path, but infrequently meaningful ones, regardless. This, on top of that in\famous tetris inventory system which I can't actually bring myself to dislike, but was also responsible for multi-minute breaks in gameplay to make sure everything was as neatly sorted as possible, so as to ensure no wasted space. \n\n\nThe difficulty curve starts out on-point, before wobbling a bit and settling on ""a bit easy, until you get to the bosses."" There's a crecendo bit near the middle of the Castle section where I hit peak frustration--incidentally, also where I discovered that you could shoot Ashley, your AI companion, resulting in an instant failure--but then after that the difficulty had a pretty steady decline, particularly for the lowest class of enemy, the Ganados or ""Cattle."" There's a few changeups here and there; flying mosquito monsters, Regenerators who slowly advance towards you while growing back appendages, but Ganados are the bread and butter and that's kind of the problem. See, once you figure them out, Ganados are seriously no big deal. Like, trivial. Which makes it a problem when you're passing through rooms and Ganados are the only thing slowing you down from this door to the next, or keeping you from solving the puzzle you'd rather be focusing on, or heck, just walking. They start out as this pretty unsettling, more-intelligent-than-a-zombie enemy, but are pretty much just fodder by chapter 4, no matter what weapon you're holding. They become nothing but a time sink, a way for the game to say ""But waaaiiit, don't you want to play some mooooore? You don't have to rush to the next story bit yeeeeet....""\n\nScrew you, game, yes I do. I've got better things on my agenda than clump-shoot-kick-repeating my way to the next door.\n\nIt's not even necessarily that the game is too easy, just the Ganados. I died multiple times to non-Ganado enemies and when I didn't I had plenty of close calls, all of which goes double for the bosses. I scraped and I counted shots, and I broke all the crates and it was really close in a lot of places. It's not the game that was too easy, it was the Ganados; trivial to dispatch (usually in great number) but still time consuming to do so. Just, getting in the way. \n\n\nLook, I can see why this game is so well remembered; it absolutely revitalized a franchise by rebuilding it almost from the ground up and was probably the last, best horror game of the early 2000's until the indies took it over and started making Amnesias and Slendermen, but look...listen...it just doesn't stand up.

"First things first : The controls are absolutely horrendous.\n\nThe character is blocking most of the view. The aim is always offset and wrong, it's impossible to be sure you're aiming in the center of the screen... or anywhere for that matter. I tried both Modern and Classic controls and haven't seen much difference. I think it went better with the classic one as far as I tried but it could've been a placebo effect and a better luck at aiming at the moment. The way the aiming is made with the mouse controls, recentering the aim where you are looking when aiming will make your aim flail around like madness in situations where you need to shoot quickly. And let's not forget the fact that Leon can't stay stable for a second, shaking the aim around.\n\nThe field of view makes me freaking sick and, as it seems, you need a mod to change it. No option and no config.ini. Never have I felt the need to pull my face off the screen that much.\n\nWhen you get swarmed by ""non-zombies"" (ughh!), there's this annoying noise, like if someone was falling on a drum kit constantly and it won't stop. Oh and there's no Sound options, so you can forget about adjusting your sounds in game.\n\nThe absurd loot coming out of ""non-zombies"", birds and boxes stays in the map for ~30 seconds if not less so you'll be running around trying to avoid and shoot zombies only to turn the corner and find that your loot is gone. And since the controls are terrible, you will need this loot (health and ammo) to compensate for it.\n\nThen there's QTE... oh why...\nYou take a break to watch that cutscene, lay off the mouse and keyboatd to relaxe and watch when suddenly, here it is, a QTE which takes you by surprise, which you miss. Now you gotta watch the whole cutscene again simply to not miss that BS QTE at the end of it because it kills you. Bra-vo! Genius gameplay design guys! *clapping*\n\nAfter 2 painful hours dying to the bad controls, I decided to take a break and write this review.\nI really wanted to retry this game since a long time, having played it on the GameCube back in the days and it's more than disappointing, it's frustrating to play.\n\nI've seen many people stating that a badly made port is the cause of many of these problems.\nIt may be Recommended for something like the FOV but many negative aspects are still coming from a game made to be different, to be ""innovative"" and to attract a new fanbase.\n\nRE4 spat on TPS (Third Person Shooters) and its own franchise to create its own OTS (Over the Shoulder) point of view and, surprisingly, many game developpers thought it was a great idea to do the same, obtructing the view of the player with its character and making it basically impossible to aim. What a great and innovative idea it was.\n\nThis game almost killed the Survival Horror genre, ripped the franchise appart, divided the fanbase and it looks like this port is even worst. What a shame.\n\n\n-A fan of Resident Evil since 2002 with Rebirth.\n\n\nPS : The graphics are alright. In fact, I do like the atmosphere of the game and the gore aspects.

(got it on PS2 first, played on Xbox, played the hell out of the Wii version, and now the best version: PC HD release!)\n\nStory: After the events of RE3: Nemesis, Leon Scott Kennedy is now an agent for the U.S. Government is sent on a mission to rescue the president's daughter Ashley Graham from an unknown organization that's located in Europe. When Leon arrives in a rural area of Europe to discover some bizarre villagers that are attacking him. It then leads to give you some creepy events that you will have find out how the villagers came to be and rescue Ashley.\n\nGameplay: You may know this game is responsible for revolutionizing the 3rd-person shooter genre and making it a standard today and it still lives up to it. Though without a doubt the gameplay does feel dated since you can't move the camera as you would expect from a modern 3rd-person shooter as well as move while aiming, reloading, and shooting. Aiming might feel clunky since you are always swaying your gun around even when standing still and moving around might be strange but you will get use to after a while. Weapons can be upgraded and bought from a merchant with the games currency to give you a better arsenal or even change your gameplay style of what weapons you want to use for your playthrough. The inventory is probably my most favorite inventory mechanic in a video game I have ever used. It's basically a suit case-which can be upgraded-which is were you store all of your items into including ammo, healing items, and attachments for weapons. It's an entire grid array so you can fit many items into but also make you decide if you should take certain items with you or not since you won't have enough space. Also the game has a NG+ to keep all your items and weapons upgrades to give you replay value.\n\nSurvival Horror: This game can give you the creeps at the start making you say ""what the h*ll is going here"", and leaves it to you to figure out what's happened. Most can be told through documents you find throughout the game and gives interesting plot points. The toughnest of the enemies as well as being out numbered by them and managing your ammo and healing items can make it a tense survival game. Boss fights can be challenging if you don't manage your inventory well enough and they have amazing designs that makes them seem very powerful. Seeing some of the creepy enemy designs latter on in the game will make your skin crawl. Though it can be argued that the game does get way more actioned focused close to the end but for the most part until 3/4 through the game it remains to be a survival horror game and one of the best ever as well.\n\nSound/Music: Gun sounds still sound good to this day and some creature's sound design can sound scary at times. The game's soundtrack does some relaxing music and even some that is really fitting for certain moments in the game whether it would be for a creepy sewer setting or a big enemy base.\n\nGraphics: Now you have to understand that this game was originally released back in 2005 for the Gamecube so you have to expect to look outdated which of course they are. Though it does have a few graphics options that does make it look better than any other version but it still does look outdated. Though you do play at higher resolution than the other platforms and this game performs very well and pretty much stays at 60fps consitently. In case if you are interested there is an HD rework project for this game that you can try out for yourself to help give the game better textures.\n\nPC port: If you remember the original PC version of RE4 was REALLY BAD. It had no mouse aiming and terrible graphics compared to other versions and was pretty much unplayable. Now with this re-release it's the PC version that we deserved! Decent graphics options, good M&K controls, full gamepad support, and beautiful consitent 60fps performance. You honestly can run this game maxed at get 60fps on a good budget PC and it will run great. No crashes throughout the entire time I played this game as well.\n\nConclusion: So you could probably tell that this is definitly one of my favorite games EVER! It helped set the standard for 3rd-person shooters and survival horror as we know it today. Sure the graphics are outdated and look very flat and muddy but it doesn't pass up for how amazing the gameplay is. The survival horror is still intense compared to other games these days and nothing has come close to match what this masterpiece of a game has made. This will forever remain as Shinji Mikami's masterpiece work of art and it has made him one of the most important video game creators of all time and he is very deserved.\n\nRating 10/10 \n\n12/10 I would get this game from Easter again! ;)",Recommended

Anyone who has ever used a GameCube controller knows the right analog stick was a tiny little knob that was difficult to use. Therefore, RE4 is best played when ignoring the right analog stick altogether.\nThe right analog stick only moves the camera(not your character) for as long as you have it held in a direction. Meaning once you release the analog stick your camera will just rubberband back into place.\n\n⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺\n\n[h1] Known Issues [/h1]\nAfter playing this game for a while I've ran into a few problems that I'd like to list below:\n\n1. Some A-series AMD CPUs aren't able run this game at all so make sure your PC meets minimum requirements.\nI suggest an A10-series AMD CPU minimum.\nIf you are greeted with black screen when trying to play, chances are it's your CPU.\n\n2. There is a serious game-ruining bug in this game that causes your fps to drop anywhere from 10-20fps. On top of that it causes a slow motion effect that makes the game unplayable.\n*Do NOT do anything someone says in a Youtube video to fix this issue. Most of the videos claiming to fix this bug are scams that just break the game further.\nThe only way I know to fix this is to open up whatever software your GPU runs with(ex. AMD has AMD Radeon settings). Find an option that allows you to force graphical settings onto certain games and make sure the target framerate is 60fps.",Recommended

"I never played Resident evil 4 until 2016 so i'm qualified to give an honest review without nostalgia burden on my shoulders. I'm however familiar to the series and played resident evils 1, 2 & 3 on playstation in the 90's.\n\nResident evil 4 is really fun and challenging to play. Constant presure of low suplies makes you think your decisions everytime as there are many ways to deal with your enemies. The pacing of the game is made perfect: new monsters, weapons, characters, areas and bosses apears right when you need one. Never felt bored while playing and that's not something i can say with every AAA-game.\n\nThe whole game world is weird in pretty much every way. Characters are strange and their actions during cutscnenes are sometimes just ridiculous. Mysterious merchants keep their shops in every empty hole you can find in the area. Village looks poor but every shelf is filled with jewels, gold coins and bars. Leon can jump 20 meters straight down without even hurting a toe (physics doesn't seems to apply in this game) . I'm not saying all this is a bad thing and i laugh all game long.\n\nThere are four problems with RE 4, none of them are gamebreaking yet all of them are annoying while playing. You can minimaze controls + inventory issues by playing with a controller. Unfortnunetely I don't have one. \n- Controls are really clunky and slow to respond. The lake scene is almost unplayable with mouse+keyboad as it is really hard to aim the harpoon.\n- Inventory management is really frustrating as you can't use mouse when moving items on your inventory screen. Managing your inventory space is really important in this game and you are moving items all the time.\n- Some of the wall and cliff textures looks ugly. Just pure laziness by the developers... all character models are made excelent.\n- no subtitles during cutscenes. You can find subtitles section in options but it can't be activated for some reason.\n\nDespite all the flaws resident evil 4 is entertaining package with hours of fun. Definitely worth checking out even today if you missed this title back in the days like i did. \n\n10 - Perfect game\n9 - Excelent game, best of the genre\n[h1]8 - Good game, worth your time[/h1]\n7 - Average game, nothing really special\n6 - Bad game, avoid\n5 - Painful to play, completely waste of time\n4 - Failed game, unpayable",Recommended
"[b] ♥♥♥♥ YOU CAPCOM FOR DESTROYING THE “X” KEY OF MY KEYBOARD [/b]\n\n[h1] TL;DR: Buy this game if you have already played RE4 on old consoles. The port is really damn good and none of the gameplay has been changed aside from leaderboards, steam achievements and badge crafting ( steam's monopoly tsk tsk)[/h1]\n\n\n[u]Aside from trying to being funny here is the real review[/u]-\n\nThe HD remaster is really awesome. Almost every scene and models and objects in the game have been remastered and their textures have been enhanced. Develepors have done real good job in delivering the product. The rain and lightining weather effect look even more astounding in this version.  The only thing I hated is that the movies and cutscenes have been remastered only in the main story campaign. Separate Ways and Assignment Ada do not have any HD movies and their quality is very shoddy (Really Capcom!? 360p?). \n\nI have played this game way back in 2007 in my PS2 (pirated) and I have easily logged more than 300+ hours in it. Do not go by my steam game play time as the game play has not changed in this version in any way. Experience wise I know this game more than many new players. I know every nook and corner in this game from the location of key treasures to finding a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ grenade in a nest on top of a tree!! Even now the grinding sound of chainsaw scares the ♥♥♥♥ outta me. I used to play this game at level 2 volume in my old console. This game was more fun playing with Action Replay codes in PS2 because there is nothing more fun than running and gunning those ganados.\n\nOne thing I surely found strange was the easy availabilty of ammos throughout the game in HD version. If I remember so then in the old console version weapon ammo would drop only when you are really short in their quantity and same goes for herbs and vice versa. I will get it verified from other players.",Recommended

"I’m kinda late to the party here, still please bear with me in case you're among those veterans of the PS2 version who now think that this game didn’t age well. \n\nFor that was exactly what I was thinking (at first blush) when the ""ultimate HD edition"" came out. I found the graphics dated and outright hideous in places – the (supposedly) “HD” overhaul cannot be compared in any way to those of REmake and Zero HD, where textures range from nice to absolutely stunning. Furthermore I had real problems to get used to tank controls again - after all these years this control paradigm of old felt real clunky to me. \n\nAnd so, after about an hour and a half in, I shelved RE4 HD again. Instead I poured 200 hours into Mikami’s “The Evil Within”, which I personally think is indeed the spiritual successor to RE4. \n\nRegarding the Resident Evil franchise, I regularily played (and still play) the PC versions of RE5, RE6, REmake HD, Zero HD as well as Revelations 1&2. You see, I’m a fan of both the old survival horror games AND the newer, more action oriented games. That’s why there still always remained a certain itch to pick up and try out RE4 yet again.  \n\nI eventually did when I recently got wind of a modding project where two very dedicated guys are redoing all the textures to make them real HD (while at the same time keeping the look and feel faithful to the original). They’re not done yet, but they’re making fast progress and what they already have to show looks absolutely fantastic. Once the overhaul is complete, this game will look as good (and in places even better) as the later entries or remakes of the franchise. \n\nI originally planned on waiting for the whole texture modding project to be done, but then decided to give the unmodded version one last go. In my earlier attempts to do that, the main obstacle to enjoying RE4 like I used to were the tank controls. I imagine I’m not the only one with that problem, even though nobody dares to say it aloud for fear of getting the “Go and play CoD then” dress-down. Anyway, I can report that the uncomfortable feeling of not being in total control over my character completely went away once I decided to put some conscious effort into getting the controls down again. It turned out it was not that hard too, really: I felt comfortable again even before the first chapter was over. I now realize that the controls are not “clunky” at all, just different.\n\nI’m now enjoying the game very much again, and I’m very happy that I stayed with it. Taking the HD modding project into account, there’s really only one aspect of the game left where I think it didn’t age too well and that is Mikami’s decision to sometimes let enemies spawn where they physically shouldn’t (because you checked or cleared out that very room or section just a few seconds ago and there’s no way these guys could have entered from somewhere). He sure did this for “horror effect” back then, but nowadays it just feels wrong. All in all, this is a very minor annoyance, though, which definitely shouldn’t deter you from enjoying this game, which is not just a great classic, but a landmark of the history of gaming itself.\n\nP.S.: As a bonus I have posted in the comments section of this review a solution to the only potentially game breaking bug the ultimate HD edition for the PC has.",Recommended

"This is, hands down, one of the best and most replayable games ever made PERIOD.\n\nYou can like it or not, obviously, but Resident Evil 4 has so much to offer it's quite hard not to have a nice time with it. This was the first game to feature the new Resident Evil layout of commands and at the time it was demonized for not being the classic survival horror as the old games were.\n\nI loved them, I really did, but it was time for a change of that clunky movement system(if you played the originals you remember it took a hour just to turn around with your feet planted onto the ground, I still miss the fixed camera though).\n\nThat being said the game is/has:\n\n- REALLY good\n- decently long\n- nice and well balanced\n- different environments\n- cool bosses and events\n- a HUGE replay value\n- more modes to play it even more!\n- tons of other stuff\n- tons of mods if you STILL feel like playing it\n\nThere's also a couple of bad things like:\n\n- the graphic is starting to show its age even though I'm accostumed to it\n- the porting. It's good but for some reason on quite a lot of GPU's it starts to slow down REALLY HARD when there's a couple more enemies on scene than there should be\n\nConsider that I'm running this on a GTX 750 2GB but I've had friends experience the issue on more powerful GPU's. You can either lock the game at 30fps or 60fps(nothing in between or above that) so setting it to 30 ""fixes"" it.\n\nI also still reccomend playing it in 30fps because that's how the games was supposed to be played when it came out and the 60fps glitch some stuff(doors and more) and even though we all love the 60fps this is not a complete overhaul of the game but just a re-texture so playing it ""as it was"" is the best option imho.\n\nThat being said if you're still thinking about getting RE4 well, I love the serie but it's still a classic for those who don't too! Wait for the sale if you're not 100% sold on this but trust me, this will give you a great time and will prepare you for RE5 which you can co-op with a friend too :)\n\nP.s. oh and to be clear don't mind my played hours here. I played it on the GameCube during the original release and finished it more than 10 times, then I played it and beat it at a friend's house a couple times, then I finished it on an ""non original"" version waiting for the sale on Steam and only THEN I got it and finished it once here.\n\nNow I have a couple more games that are keeping me busy but I plan to finish it over and over again here, it's just THAT good ;)",Recommended

"It's been a minute since I've played this on the Gamecube. So how is it?\n.............................................\n+ gameplay is pretty tight. Sometimes I wish I could move the camera faster or turn faster, but aside from that it feels great to this day.\n\n+ This game works its tones well. On one side the cheesy dialogue and whacky characters are super fun like Salazar skimpering out of the spike room and on the other we have tense, eerie moments like being hunted by Verdugo.\n\n+ music is varied and lets me drink in each environment.\n\n+ good amount of challenge in this. You can't move and shoot, so taking careful aim and thinking about how to out pace the enemy is key.\n\n+ checkpoints are pretty generous. Save opportunites come often, but they still place checkpoints at the beginning of most rooms in case you goof.\n.............................................\n~ for the most part the port is good. HD graphics are nice and this package gives you a lot of extra content; however, I did encounter a few odd hiccups. Notably the infamous minecart QTE  section that I had trouble passing because the graphics were set to fixed 60 fps. A more unfortunate one was a hard crash after a lengthy section of trenches and a helicopter.\n.............................................\n- I'm always going to dock this for changing the direction of the game to action horror from survival horror. Don't get me wrong I love this game, but this could EASILY have not been a Resident Evil game and just swapped out Leon and Ada.\n\n- There are lots of things this game brought to the industry, but I can't remember QTEs being as popular after the release of RE4. QTEs can be fine, but instakill QTEs are just frustrating. Make QTEs like stairs: step correctly and keep going. Step incorrectly and slip a bit, not break your head open at the bottom of the stairwell.\n.............................................\n\nDon't choose a side.

"I have played through Resident Evil 4 probably fifteen times, and before I die I will probably play through it fifteen more. It's the kind of game that always feels good to play--it has challenging but masterable combat mechanics, an addicting weapon upgrade system, and most importantly, wonderful level design and environments. There's no respectable story to speak of, which makes the game all the more remarkable since it manages to snare the player solely on the merits of its design and mechanics. \n\nThe main reason I keep playing Resident Evil 4 is because I enjoy being in the game's environments. Sure, there are a lot of locations in the game that are absolutely miserable, but those locations are an essential half of a contrasting environment dynamic the Resident Evil games have always deployed. To build tension and horror, Resident Evil games cram the player into dark, cramped, filthy places, and it's only after the player has managed to make it through these uncomfortable spaces that they are rewarded with a ""safe"" space, usually an area with a typewriter (for saving games) and no enemies. I've always liked the atmosphere of these areas, but in Resident Evil 4 they are especially wonderful. Often these safe spaces appear outdoors after the player has been trudging through some claustrophobic indoor location, and the experience can really feel like a breath of fresh air. This tension-and-release dynamic also makes the game really satisfying to play, because the player feels like they've earned each moment of peace and safety.\n\nThe combat mechanics in Resident Evil 4 took some flak when the game first launched in 2005 because Leon can move and attack, but he can't do both at the same time. Of course, anyone who understands the need for tension-building in horror will recognize the ignorance of those complaints. One of the big reasons RE4's combat is so compelling is because of Leon's mobility handicap; it feels really stressful to be anchored in place while a horde of enemies creeps ever closer, and it feels really rewarding to survive a hairy encounter by skillfully knowing when to move and when to shoot. \n\nAs I said before, RE4's story is pretty terrible. Still, the game has excellent pacing which is set by the level design and enemy frequency. Unlike earlier Resident Evil games, there's not a lot of area recursion in RE4, so the game feels like it's always progressing quickly even though it takes nearly 15-20 hours to complete. \n\nResident Evil 4's weapon upgrade system functions in tandem with a simple yet addicting in-game economy based around treasure hunting. Unique treasures are hidden throughout the game world, and players who find them can sell them and purchase new weapons and upgrades. The game economy is well-balanced, and the weapon upgrades always feel like they're popping up at just the right moments--more evidence that the game was meticulously planned out. I always like my survival horror games to be on the difficult side, and from my experience, the original GameCube version of RE4 had lower values for treasure items, making the upgrades slightly harder to get and the game more difficult. The PS2 and Steam versions of the game seem comparatively easy to me, even on Professional difficulty. \n\nThere are some things I've found in this world that, despite their dark themes and focus on death, give me a surprising feeling of calm and comfort--the now defunct band [url=thepaperchase.bandcamp.com]""The Paper Chase""[/url] and the YouTube channel [url=www.youtube.com/user/OrderoftheGoodDeath/]""Ask A Mortician""[/url] are examples. I also add Resident Evil 4 to this list. Yes, it is the game where my heart races as I carefully count the number of shotgun shells I've unloaded into the chainsaw-wielding monster trying to decapitate me, but it is also the game where I step out onto moonlit castle battlements, my footsteps on the cobblestone breaking through the quiet night and startling a murder of crows away from a gem-filled fountain. Resident Evil 4 is a game full of spaces and experiences to which I will always return.",Recommended

"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv0UuIVS9Nw\n\nIf a franchise sticks around long enough, it will inevitably be faced with the uphill battle of trying to evolve to meet the needs of an ever changing landscape. After the half step toward full 3D in Code Veronica, Capcom struggled to reinvent Resident Evil for a new console generation. An early effort was re-purposed and became the brilliant Devil May Cry but it would take many years for a new vision to take shape. When Resident Evil 4 finally hit store shelves for the Gamecube in 2005, it would forever change the face of survival horror video games. \n	\nPlayers once again filled the shoes of Leon Kennedy as he searches for the President's daughter, Ashley Graham, in a remote area of Spain. She is being held by a mysterious cult who are trying to utilize a mind controlling parasite called Las Plagas to gain power. The village that Leon first comes across is filled with infected townsfolk called Ganados who are hellbent on stopping Leon and completely loyal to Osmund Saddler, the leader of the Illuminados cult. Lurking behind the scenes is the familiar face of Ada Wong whose activities are a mystery. Resident Evil 4 continues the tradition of offering an eccentric and ridiculous narrative that successfully links some of the franchise's biggest characters to it's events but also stands well enough on it's own that newcomers are not left scratching their heads.\n	\nThe tank controls of past Resident Evil games are gone, the camera instead looks over Leon's shoulder in a fully 3D rendered environment. The camera's position obscures some of the action and creates some tense moments while allowing players to enjoy more fluid and natural controls. When aiming his gun or wielding a knife, Leon remains in a fixed position which may seem unnatural to action game aficionados but it does create some tense moments as groups of enemies converge on Leon's position. With this new control scheme gunplay is a much bigger focus than in past Resident Evil titles. Enemies come in greater volumes, ammo for basic weapons is more plentiful and there are a few set piece moments that require you to gun down scores of ganados lest they tear Leon's limbs from his body. When it comes to gameplay and combat, the Plagas present a satisfying new angle to the gameplay in Resident Evil. The Ganados function the same as the Zombies in prior titles but with added tenacity and dexterity. They throw axes and dynamite, climb ladders and leap across small chasms in pursuit of Leon. Additionally, relieving a hapless Ganado of his or her head may not be the end of a fight since the pesky Plagas are prone to evacuate their hosts and tackle Leon directly or cowardly emerge from the bloody stumps of their necks, flailing their tentacle like bodies like guillotine blades attached to a weed eater. Shield bearing cult members and blind mutants with massive claws that must be dispatched by killing the parasites on their backs also refresh the enemy roster and make the combat in Resident Evil 4 more satisfying. Several satisfying boss fights provide the cherry on top of the Resident Evil 4 gameplay experience. \n	\nThe greater focus on action does mean that scares are less frequent then they were in previous entries. Wandering around a hedge maze with Plagas infested wolves waiting to jump out of bushes and seeking keys whilst being pursued by wheezing, seemingly unstoppable regenerators are some of Resident Evil 4's few terrifying highlights during it's three acts. While the first two acts are enjoyable and varied the end of the third act is a monotonous shooting gallery that culminates in one of the easiest final boss battles in the series. For a game with so many strong characters and boss scenarios the conclusion is a bit anti-climatic. This handful of minor grimace worthy moments is largely lost in amidst the rest of the experience which will take most players fifteen or more hours on their first playthrough. \n	\nAs if the main campaign wasn't long enough, Assignment Ada reveals some of Ada's activities behind key moments in Resident Evil 4, fleshing out the narrative and offering some new weapons and mechanics to challenge Resident Evil fans. Mercenaries mode challenges players to survive and kill as many enemies as possible. It's an addictive mode that would go on to become a staple of the franchise by enticing players with a risk reward system, stringing together kills gives players a multiplier and breaking hourglasses extends the time of the session, providing a greater opportunity to post a high score. With these additional modes, it's really easy to get thirty hours of entertainment from Resident Evil 4.\n	\nThe muted, earth tone rich Spanish village that serves as Resident Evil 4's setting is a massive departure from the dark, claustrophobic and sinister mansion from the first game and the post apocalptic city scape of the second and third games. When it was first released, Resident Evil 4 was one of the most impressive graphical showcases of the Playstation 2 and Gamecube. With a 1080p resolution and some uprezed textures, Resident Evil 4 looks it's age but it is still capable of impressing. The atmosphere is as rich in 2016 as it was in 2005 but we do wish Capcom gave this game the respect to completely overhaul it in the same way that they did the fist Resident Evil game for the Gamecube. Rest assured however, this new HD port of Resident Evil 4 finally gives PC players an acceptable version of this classic to play.   \n	\nResident Evil 4 is a bittersweet experience, along with Half life 2, it helped foreshadow what was to come with new hardware as well as perfectly reinvigorating and updating a franchise that was in danger of loosing it's appeal as new hardware changed gamers expectations. In doing so however, Resident Evil 4 shifted the franchise's inertia toward action and with the next couple installments, Resident Evil would almost entirely forsake it's horror roots. With the death of Resident Evil as a horror game, much of the survival horror genre fell into mediocrity with Dead Space being one of the few titles to successfully straddle the line between action and horror before becoming a victim of the same fate. Resident Evil 4 is one of the greatest games of the new millennium. It maintained enough of the elements of it's predecessors to be identifiable as a Resident Evil game while otherwise reinventing the franchise. It's timeless gameplay, great art direction and mostly excellent bosses make it very playable almost a decade after it's original release. If you haven't played Resident Evil 4, now is as good a time as any.",Recommended

I do remember playing it briefly as kid on PS2 but I was either too scared of the fish munsta or I kept dying to the piece of trash.\n\nGreat game. I feel like the quality does decline over the course of the game.\n \nThe beginning is great. The town, being chased by crazy people and then bell rings and they dissapear. It sets up an incredible atmosphere and vibe that was as intriguing as it was sort of terrifying.\n\nThings get gradually more nonsensical and campy as it progresses. \nThe big fish monster; cool. \nThe big ugly troll; cool but mostly because during the fight a dog you previously saved from a bear trap, shows up, helps you kill the baddie and then peaces the f out; never to be seen again.\n\nI feel like the decline begins at the castle. infected knights in armor (?), this old little creepy Spanish kid with jaundice eyes, a boss fight (kinda) that is literally a red robed a$$hole emerging from the ground on a mounted minigun. \nAnd from here it descends into levels of campiness that rivals the MGS franchise. Kauserhonestly could have been a Metal Gear Solid antagonist and not been out of place.\n\nAnd the worst part is baby sitting Ashley. It was a pain in the damn gourd and as a character I did not care about her. She just screamed ""LEON!"" and made some weird sound when you catch her that sounds suspiciously like the sound Princess Ruto makes when you throw her on her a$$ in Lord Jubu Jubu. However, you can order her to hide in a dumpster so i feel good about that.\n\nAnd most important point; Ada Wong is the babe, dude.\n\nAlso, they escape an isolated island on a jet ski. How they gonna get to main land on a fkn jet ski?\n\nIt's apparent, even eleven years later, how Resident Evil 4 single handedly innovated a genre.

"Very fun game with good replay value for a singleplayer only game because unlocking guns and different story missions after completing the main one gives players a reason to do multiple playthroughs. Being able to play as a different character is a great implementation in a game because it gives players multiple perspectives of different scences in the story. Gunplay and gun upgrades feel very satisfying by giving players a choice to use the same weapon and upgrade it or sell it to use a different one.  Not being able to run and shoot mixed in with horror has made the resident series stand out from other ones (exluding Resident Evil 6) because it forces players to be accurate when shooting their weapon. The gameplay builds off of that aspect by making weakspots on enemies rewarding by staggering them when shot in thier weakspot a number of times. I have personaly bought this game numerous times first time on ps3, second time when they released an HD version on ps4, and third time on the PC. This game is a personal favorite of mine that i love to play and continue to play every so often because its just damn fun! I recommend this game even at full price because its a damn good game that is fun to play and has plenty of content to keep people occupied making this game a real gem in my steam library so far.",Recommended
"First and foremost, I put a negative on this game before hand. Saying it had bad optimized support, I dont know by some miracle, the game runs fine. This was one of my favorite games while I was a youngin, stll is. Im running at a smooth 60 FPS, no dips, no slow mo. I'm not sure if Capcom made a update for PC users, but it runs fine. \n\nTo those who never played Resident Evil 4, there is a bit of learning curve to it, once you start to learn how to move, and shoot, it'll become like second nature to you. I have never experienced a crash on the game, I love how its easy to earn achievements, its pretty straight forward. The AI in this game is pretty good. I MISSED HEARING, ""WHADDYA BUYIN? STRANGA?"" it makes me laugh not because it has a cheesy line, but all the memories of playing this game with friends.\n\nShot gun is still pretty OP, though its fun wrecking stuff shooting a shot gun. Even with the HD textures, it looks standard to keep the nostalgia, Capcom did a wonderful job using their MascotCapsule engine. \n\nThere's so much to do in this game, side ops, treasure hunting, and even the main missions, each has a certain charm. There's only five chapters, but its episodic so each chapter is long. The recommendations to this game though is a lie, you need a pretty beefy computer to play it.

"""Apologizing for the old (2007) version; we will be releasing a better (2014) version"" - CAPCOM's way to say sorry.\n\n[h1]WARNING: DO NOT BUY THIS GAME, IT'S BROKEN, IF YOUR PC RUNS RE5 FINE ON MEDUIM TO HIGH SETTINGS, THIS GAME LIKELY WON'T WORK PROPERLY, FOR A CRAPPY SM GAME FROM 2004, THIS IS BEYOND TRAGIC.[/h1]\n\nWhat is good?\nThe only thing good about this version is that its graphically better and has real time cutscenes and better rendering (compared to the trashy 2007 port by SOURCENEXT which was completely based on the PS2 version and even worse).\n\nWhat is not?\n[*]Aside from that its the same old ass game untouched, same old extras, not even a single new costume or story dlc, same old terrible engine (ancient crap), It's also getting ported to next gen, this engine will screw up one day.\n[*]You'd think they would have remade the game on MT Framework in the style of RE5 by now but now, they keep remilking this, I got it with a bundle, I would not waste my money on this if you expected it to look better than before, its the same and the HD textures are mostly upscales, not really worth it, I suppose QLOC are even lazier than CAPCOM who are even so lazy to work and make their own ports, they didn't say a thing, they just wanted the money, while multiple other graphically high games work fine, this game suffers from slow downs at many parts in the game even at 30 FPS. \n[*]The concept of REmilking RE4: The same old game remilked over and over (also coming out on Xbox One an PS4 soon; I wouldn't buy it ever again, that's enough, unless its remade on a completely new engine with enough extras then I might reconsider.\n[*]They didn't even update the textures for real, how do we expect them to remake it in a new engine? these two artistic fans are doing a better job - www.re4hd.com\n[*]NO Achievments for Separate Ways, Assingment Ada or for unlocking a special weapon like the ""Chicago Typewriter"" because this is basically a console port which should've also included more achivements (I played the PS3 version first but I didn't buy it, I won't buy RE4 ever again, unless it's different).\n[*]Separate Ways will never get real-time cutscenes because CAPCOM either lost the source files, or are too lazy to use it or too lazy to remake anything in this game aside from the HUD and rescaling textures (which QLOC did).\n\nMy honest opinion:\n[*]I love this game, when I played it multiple times in the past, but re-releasing it over and over on modern systems like this; even with lack of optimization (terrible performance) and no Recommended HD textures; I do not support that, so ""no"" from me.\n[*]Get it only if you want to get those basic and easy to get achievments (I'm compensating my PS3 progress here...)",Not Recommended

"This is a major problem, I am playing this game on a Alienware 15 laptop with 980 Nvidia and Windows 10 64 Bit installed. If you have this setup STAY AWAY! First problem I noticed is any time I messed with any settings at all graphically (including going to higher resolution or adjusting framerate) it would freeze in its tracks, forcing me to open up task manager and shut it down. So I decided to not mess with any settings at all, fine, however I began to notice small frame drops and laggy sound, but not enough to drive me crazy. Now here's the kicker, it crashes...every...15...minutes...WHAT?! That's absolutely unacceptable. As a game where you can't save every 5 seconds, that's a huge problem that I simply can't ignore. Just in level 1-1 alone I crashed 3 times. What is this? Absolutely unacceptable that's what. Looking at the previous updates it doesn't seem like the Devs care enough to update it anyways, so I am staying far away.

"This is one of my favorite games of all time and I’m probably really biased because of this. Nevertheless, I just completed the game once again (as well as the last achievement for 100% completion). I don’t know how many times I have, I stopped counting after 20.\n\nHowever, I have played most versions of this game and it’s easy to say that this is the definitive version. It has everything that any remakes had, all the additional modes, the additional costumes and the additional weapons. It also features higher-resolution textures and for the first time ever, somewhat functional keyboard and mouse control. To be completely honest however, this is one of the only shooters that I would much rather play with a controller.\n\nIt has everything and it looks prettier than ever. Runs at any 16:9 resolution (I played in 2560x1440) and is capped at 60 FPS. It’s kind of a joke that they’re still making money off of this game over 10 years later but I think the 20$ is well worth it. If you already know about this game, that’s about it. If not, keep reading.\n\nThis game came out 11 years ago as I’m writing this. It was mind-blowing for its time. The only thing that held back its amazing graphics were the low-res textures, which have now been updated. Visually, it aged very well.\n\nGames have evolved a lot since then. While at the time the story felt amazing, it feels pretty simple and cheesy today. Most of the dialogues is actually really cheesy. I really don’t mind it however, the game feels very to the point. The story supports the game and not the other way around.\n\nYou will often see things that do not have an explanation other than convenience and honestly, that’s fine. Some games nowadays are so anal about being realistic that it removes a lot from the game. I do not care that this mysterious merchant seems omnipresent for no reason and that nobody seems to care he’s selling weapons to their enemies, because I want my weapons and upgrades!\n\nIn that sense, the game has a much more “Arcade” feel than most games of that genre that come out nowadays. I absolutely love the theming in this, the areas are all very distinct and they have completely different enemies and environments.\n\nThe controls could feel a bit dated however. Keep in mind that this game was released on the Gamecube first and was designed entirely around it. As such, the controls might seem very odd and unconventional. This is due to the fact that the Gamecube controller made use of a single Joystick most of the time, while the other was rarely used. Because of this, both moving and aiming is done with the same Joystick.\n\nThis might seem annoying at first, but if you are familiar with survival horrors, the restricted vision and movement are often part of what makes it stressful. In this game, your character does not have a steady aim, even when standing still. Shooting while running is out of the question.\n\nThere are tons of things to collect in this game. However, unlike many games, these are actually useful. Instead of running around gathering feathers that serve literally no purpose, you will be incentivized to look all around for ammo, grenades and health. It never felt like a chore to me, but simply a necessity to survive. Other collectibles are treasures that can be sold for money, which you can then use to purchase new weapons or upgrades for those you already own. This is one of the few games where looking for treasures felt rewarding and useful, instead of being there just for the sake of making the game longer or giving you a trophy for it. You do it for your own benefit and if you don’t it’s your problem.\n\nSpeaking of weapons and upgrades, a cool thing about this game is that every weapon is good in its own way. Every single weapon as unique special ability and comparable stats to others. In the end, it boils down to what you prefer. You never have to feel like you’ve upgraded your weapon for nothing if you can purchase a new one and you can always sell the ones you have if you want to purchase a new one. It also makes the game very fun to replay as you get to try new weapons.\n\nThe game is not extremely long but your first playthrough will most likely last you much longer than any subsequent ones. The game can actually be completed very quickly, which in my book, indicates that it is well designed and doesn’t have too many tedious parts. It features a new game + mode which lets you carry over your stuff and have revenge on everyone that scared the shit out of you.\n\nAI is relatively simple but surprisingly reactive. You probably already know it’s a zombie game, but in this game, the zombies will walk or run, cover their faces if you aim at them, try to move and dodge, etc. This is more apparent when playing on the Professional difficulty. The headshots also feel, very, very satisfying in this (and eventually terrifying).\n\nThe added Separate Ways mode adds a cool short (4-5 hours) little story that fits with Leon’s story and “explain” some of the events. I liked how Ada’s examine comments reflected her personality instead of being simple narration. Hers were usually much more witty and sarcastic. The mercenaries is a really cool mini-game where you get to play different characters in a more arcade play style.\n\nAll in all, I think Resident Evil 4 is a perfect blend of an action third-person shooter and a survival horror game that everyone should play!",Recommended

"I've never had to request a refund from Steam before, which is a shame because Resident Evil 4 on Gamecube was one of my favorite games. This PC port, however, leaves a bad aftertaste.\n\nHaving played only 9 minutes and fighting a handful of enemies in a small environment, my computer seemed to play the game in slow-motion. For those familiar with the game, I did NOT make it to the scene where the village turns on you and you must hold out until the bell rings. Instead, I spent most of my time turning on and off the two or three video options available for customization as well as messing with the resolution. Nothing I tried seems to fix the issue.\n\nI have played more graphically intensive games on my computer with much better results. In addition, other players with much higher stated computer specs have complained of the same issue. I can only assume that, much like some other PC ports done by Capcom, that this was done in a rush and on the cheap.\n\nIf you're looking to play this game, get it on one of the consoles it was originally developed for.

For a game that is as old as this is, it's just completly unacceptable to have a game so poorly optimized as this. As i can play the game rather well in 720p i'll give this game a reccomended review but beware of this port not running very well on your system.",Recommended

"RESIDENT EVIL: NEVER GO TO EUROPE EDITION\n\nWe have vampire cultists, giants, giant fish, smaller fishmen, terrifying claymen, more vampire cultists and the most terrifying of them all: Spanish farmers. This is actually how it is like to live in Europe. A very accurate attempt at simulating our lifestyle. Hell, most of us wear cloves of garlic around our necks to ward off roaming vampires.\n\nThe story of the game itself is about an American tourist that heads out to meet his online girlfriend, Alice, who lives in Spain. She is also the Alice from Alice in Wonderland, since that's a European story. His ex keeps calling him up on the trip, though, and he gets so distracted that he gets in trouble with the local townspeople, who in turn send the vampire cultists on him. Now Leon has to go and find Alice, get her out of Spain, which is a hellhole filled with vampires, and then contemplate if he is in fact bisexual, as he meets a hot Spanish super-cop on the way there as well.\n\nThis game gets a ten out of ten rating from me as probably the most accurate simulation of European life.",Recommended

"I have played and beaten this game probably 4 or 5 times on the Gamecube and have logged in well over 60-70 hours on the Gamecube version.

"The first pc version of Resident Evil 4 was quite flawed and lazy but thankfully Capcom turned things around in 2014 with a remastered version featuring sharper graphics and full keyboard/ mouse support. As Leon you'll be tasked with rescuing the president's daughter from a group of fanatics and you'll soon realize things are way darker than you've expected.\nWhile showing its age in places and strying somewhat far from the slow burn horror of its predecessors RE4 is a great game finally given a worthy port.\n\n[b]PROS:[/b]\n\n-good sound design and soundtrack\n\n-great atmosphere\n\n-a pretty straightforward and less cheesy story that works quite well\n\n-the infected villagers and other bioweapons you'll encounter are a breath of fresh air from the usual zombies and'll require new strategies\n\n-great boss battles\n\n-the game is more action oriented than the previous ones thus providing an enjoyable and challenging experience where you are often pitted against many enemies: you'll need to strategize\n\n-great length, expect at least 14 hours (plus extra modes after you complete the game if you're so inclined)\n\n\n[b]NEUTRAL:[/b]\n\n-the standard RE cheesy dialogues clash a bit too much with the serious tone of the story\n\n-while the graphical update is welcome it's a bit of a mixed bag, character and monster models are pretty nice but most textures aren't too sharp\n\n-puzzles are very simple, I'm personally fine with it but some might miss the more complex ones found in previous episodes\n\n-sections where you have to babysit the presiden't daughter can be a bit annoying \n\n\n\n[b]CONS:[/b]\n\n-cramped camera\n\n-controls feel a bit sluggish overall and betray the game's age\n\n-instadeath quicktime events during cutscenes are just annoying\n\n-a couple of quicktime events are extremely buggy if the game is set at 60fps, they're almost impossible to pull off and you'll have to quit the game (losing about 10 minutes of progress if it happens in the mine cart section) and set it to a slightly nauseating 30fps to pass them\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=640302711\n\nResident Evil 4 abandons the old fixed camera shots and most of the sense of dread in favour of an over-the shoulder camera and tense fights that often pit you against many enemies able to use tools such as weapons, shields or objects in the environment: it's a big change, one that not only provides a fresh experience but that also influenced the next games both in plot and gameplay.\n\nIt works, and it works quite well even though it's not as innovative as it was when it first came out: in fact the somewhat clunky controls and cramped camera will possibly make modern players turn up their noses. It must be said that as awkward as they might be at times old design choices like being rooted on the spot when aiming and having a limited turn radius do evoke a genuine sense of dread when you're faced with several enemies scrambling from different directions or simply need to target a bioweapon's vulnerable spot while trying to not be shredded to bits.\n\nMy only complains are the annoying quicktime events during cutscenes, they add little to nothing and are just frustrating when you miss them and have to watch the cutscene all over again. Even worse are two unsolved bugs where Leon fails to climb on ledges if the game is set to 60fps: the biggest culprit here is the mine cart section where the previous save point is 10 to 15 minutes beforehand. Having to quit the game to set it to 30fps and then having to start over to pass the bugged QTE was not fun at all and is a bug that'd have been solved.\n\nEven with a few niggling issues Resident Evil 4 is a great game in the series and the last remaster finally gives us a worthy port to enjoy on PC: it's a definite purchase for fans of the genre, maybe just read beforehand on the two bugged QTEs to avoid any annoyances.",Recommended

Some are so incredibly difficult that you may be forced to switch to 30fps and then you are forced to play in 30fps until the next save.\n- Many non rebindable keys\n- No audio options \n- No subtitles (in english)\n\nThe game itself also has many one hit deaths that are just frustrating and don't feel like I as a player did anything wrong, just got unlucky.\n\nIt's an OK game, but with all these problems I wouldn't recommend it in full price.",Recommended

It is a bit dated since you can't move and shoot, but the enemies are adjusted around this with their attacks and AI. It has the BEST PACING I've ever seen in a game to date. It feels satisfying. You feel an improvement of your skills and weapons by the end of the game and you are constantly given new enemies and a few random mechanics thrown in here and there. There's a decent amount of replayability and an extra campaign.

A few moments and enemies are definetly creepy however. Don't buy it expecting to be scared. Buy it for an amazing action game experience.

"I have a love/hate relationship with this game, it's one of my top horror games. However when it came to PC I had to try it out. Thank god for the refund service. For me with my laptop it's difficult to run due to the integrated graphics card. For the life of me I couldn't find a resolution that had the upper and lower black bars that I love, even in standard def the game still wouldn't run well. But that's my issue, I don't have a decent PC like many of you will. However what makes me angry is that fact that this port seems so bad. Games from the same year and newer have better ports than this. But if you have the PC for it, this game is a must have.",Recommended

"""Whaddaya buyin?\nGot a selection of good things on sale, stranger.""\n\n\n\nI will keep it short since basicly everything about this game was already told countless times.\nI did enjoy playing it a lot. In fact played entired game with my fiance and damn it was a blast how much she enjoyed it.\n""Because of Ashley and climate, and enemies, las plagas and so on"" those are her words not mine, and believe me she's not really a gamer or a person who like to blow shit up in videogames. And yet we beat it together for the reason above and i do totaly agree with it. Climat is great, atmosphere is really cool especially in the early stages when you are dropped into the village with absolutely no idea what to expect. Graphic... well design is amazing both protagonist and antagonist (sometimes it gets bit confusing who is which of them which is cool too). Desing of enemies along with all sounds and voices does a marvelous job for the game BUT keep in mind that this is and older game and it's just a PC port from PlayStation 2 WHICH was already a port from GameCube soo... You get the idea right ? Overall visuals appeal to gamers but they are far from amazing, and to add you even more graphic WAS of this game could be amazing about... 2 years prior to it's release. Anyway screw it, it does the job fair enough if you will remember that it's old. As I said before Sounds and voices are pure gold, all sounds just like it suppose to and that's most important. Music ? There is none. Gameplay wise - it's realy fun and enjoyable BUT not from the start. At start IT SUCKS. And you know why it sucks ? Because it's the worst kind of port loop. What i mean by that ? Everyone who played probably already know. If there is a thing that will get you mad and bitching about everything IT'S CONTROLS. You see the most important thing in enjoyable PLAYTHROUGH IS BEING ABLE TO PLAY THROUGH. But give it a shot. I know that game should hook you just from the start, and RE4 tries, it reall tries as hard as it can especially with atmosphere but also unfortunately slaps you straight into you dirty face and punch in the balls. Playing the first hour will get you used to it though and later only from time to time you will bitch about it. \nAll and all i'm telling you guys - if for some reason you did not play it yet, do it. Try to play it in small doses tho since it may become a bit repetetive at times and bit boring at the end. But those are just minor complains that doesn't really affect overall game play experience. There is now also lot of bonus content, like mercenaries mode, sorta like a minor campaigns and literally TONS of content in here. Buy it, have fun and try to forgive that it's rather clumsy port of another port. It's definitely recommended and the BEST resident evil game to date in my opionion and plenty of other players and the game that you should try despite the fact of being or not Resident Evil fan. Definitely amazing, especially the 1st half of the game.\nHave a good day guys !\nFrankCastle51 out.",Recommended

"This is about the peak area for the horror aspect of the Resident Evil series, RE4 is probably one of my top Resident Evil games. of course it still has the whole cannot move shoot aspect to it which takes a bit for someone who hasn't played RE in awhile to adjust to, in my case at least.  I personally don't get as annoyed by Ashley as most players do but I do see where their coming from, I feel like Ashley inspired the co-op aspect that appears in the next game.  In full I think RE4 is good, well paced horror game, and is definitely worth playing.",Recommended
"“Insect lives don’t compare to human lives!”\n\nOK, first thing to get out of the way is the fact that the dialogue is atrociously camp and the characters are mere caricatures (not to mention oddly sexist, especially for 2005) – as if the whole thing was written by a teenage boy – but, like Star Wars’ wilful ignorance of science, politics, or military ranks, these things have become a hallmark of the series, and it wouldn’t feel like Resident Evil without them.\n\nTaking that into account, I really loved this game.  It gets everything right that, oddly, the more recent game, The Evil Within, by the same designer gets wrong.  The two games have plenty in common, but RE4 gets the balance right every time where TEW fails to do so.  They both have wonky controls, but they are just responsive enough in RE4 so that it doesn’t feel like the game is actively fighting you.  They both have challenging boss fights, but where in TEW you have to use the One Solution and can be one-shotted by almost every boss the moment you make a mistake, in RE4 you have options -- and because a boss has to hit you a few times to kill you, you can actually learn from your mistakes, backing off a bit to heal and/or switch weapons.  I find it much more dramatic to figure out how to defeat an enemy while fighting it than sitting on the load screen (or tabbing out to the internet) because my character was killed instantly for putting one foot in the wrong place.\n\nA related area where RE4 shines is its autosave points.  Unlike TEW, where defeat often meant having to replay whole sections of the game just to get back to the fiendishly difficult point, RE4 saves before every boss fight, as well as at other key points.  Not to mention the manual save points, which are spread out just enough to make you value them.  The pacing is also excellent, alternating betwen tense, life-threatening situations and calmer moments when you have a chance to explore the area.\n\nThere is plenty of content in this game, ranging over a variety of settings.  Several times when I thought it was about to end, I was pleasantly surprised to find there was another chapter to follow – yet it never wears out its welcome.  This is partly to do with an expertly-designed progression of power.  The chances to improve Leon’s abilities and weapons are doled out at just the right pace, not giving you too much at once and forcing you to make choices, but not being miserly about it either.  Enemy difficulty ramps up at an appropriate pace as well, and although there were a few instances where it seemed to be unfairly challenging, after succeeding on a second attempt it all felt right – I never had that “how was I supposed to know to do that?” feeling.\n\nI could mention some minor niggles, like there being no hint anywhere that you have to aim to reload your weapon (why??), the inexplicable (though appreciated) dropping of ammo by foes with no firearms, or the fact that their houses are full of it, or the strange, persistent presence of a mysterious arms dealer who seems to be ignorant of all that’s going on around him (and who has plenty of weapons but not a single bullet for sale) – but those don’t hinder the gameplay at all.  My strongest complaint about the game is probably Leon’s ridiculous hairstyle, but if that makes it to the top of a problem list, you know the game itself has to be really good.\n\nThe add-on missions that are unlocked when you first complete the game don't quite measure up to the main story: there's hardly any power progression and very little to buy with collected treasures, and there are one or two times where the game forces the character to take actions that make no sense, but none of that takes away from the main game.\n\nRECOMMENDATION: if you use kb & mouse and remap the keys to anything other than the default, I strongly recommend you edit the ini file (http://steamcommunity.com/app/254700/discussions/0/627456486960742247/) to change the QTE keys to something more convenient.  I use the arrow keys for movement, and I was able to change KEY_1 and KEY_2 to Left and Right so I didn’t even have to move my left hand.",Recommended

Although stll a solid port to say even if the requirements are a little bloated for a 12 year old game.)\n\nResident Evil 4 put simply, as many have already done so, is the best game in the series as a whole even. While its obviously different from what Resident Evil started out as what it turned into was an immensely satisfying Genre defining Third person shooter with Impeccable design, Fantastic art style and set piece design, An atmosphere that cant be beat thanks to the great sound design, a campy and self aware story with a lot of cheese and hilarity to it but its brilliant pacing cannot be ignored and a game just bursting with content from the main campaign to multiple DLC Packs and the excellent Mercenaries mode.\n\nStill an Incredible game which holds its crown and legacy in the Video Game industry proudly. A timeless classic.\n\n9.5/10",Recommended
"Alright, listen up. You probably have already played RE4 at some point, so this is going to be a ""port report"". First off, the game speed is tied to the framerate and you get to pick between a 30 and 60 FPS lock. Now although this is an old game, you are probably going to need at least a Quad-core CPU and more than 3GB of RAM if you want to run it at 60 and not experience any slowdowns even with the standart textures. The game was never meant to work at 60 FPS, and this is especially obvious when it's raining and the framerate gets cut in half, but I think this is probably because I'm barely over the minimum requirements. Also, I believe that 6 patches in, QLOC, unlike Capcom, have done all they could to truly make this the definitive version of RE4 given their limitations. Even if you have to play the game at 30 FPS with standart textures, you still get a version with all DLC (unless you are German, because again: Capcom), proper PC controls (you still have to deal with tank controls, but at least you get proper QTE prompts, rebindable keys and mouse aiming) and basic modding support with a HD mod project being worked on as we speak, which is set to replace EVERY texture with a HD one.\nIn conclusion: This is a decent port and QLOC did everything they could to fix and improve it (unlike Capcom which can't be bothered to patch RE5 more than once after they did a piss-poor job of porting it to Steamworks, instead just adding trading cards and stickying fan fixes for gamebreaking bugs).",Recommended
"its literally 2016 and most of the buggy things ported over still havent been fixed, seriously?\nLOVED the ps2 version, but this port is still ridiculously buggy and the mouse+keyboard navigation is ridiculous and you gotta wrestle with it. also, not sure if its on my end, but my xbox controller (despite multiple googling sessions) refuses to act as anything but a glorified mouse in game. 2/10 at least you tried",Not Recommended
"Quick rundown: Resident Evil 4 is an action/horror hybrid that plays similar to the Dead Space games, and in terms of mechanics is probably halfway between the original Resident Evil games and the action oriented RE 5 & 6. The controls are rather clunky if you’ve played the later games (like me) and the graphics are dated, which should be no surprise since the game is over 10 years old (and is a console port). I remember the old version of RE 4 didn’t even have an exit option, you had to alt + F4 to quit the game. They fixed that for the Steam version though.\n\nI’ve never played the first Resident Evil games since I play games on PC, but if you have then I’m sure you’ll recognize the main character Leon Kennedy. As Leon, it’s your job to find and rescue the president’s missing daughter Ashley from a cult of zombie-like villagers in a dark and gloomy farming village. You find almost immediately that despite appearances these villagers are ferociously and fanatically protective of the area, and will attack you on sight with any weapon they can get their hands on. Fortunately they’re mostly slow moving… like zombies. The villagers are being controlled by the cult leader through the use of an ancient type of parasite called Las Plagas that can cause grotesque transformations in victims, which means monstrous enemies for you to fight!\n\nYou control Leon through the third person perspective which is kind of badly implemented because Leon covers about a quarter of the screen at times and the slow camera control makes it difficult to see around him. Since the game was a port from a console, you have a slight advantage with keyboard+mouse when it comes to aiming your gun, but the game is pretty forgiving when it comes to where your bullets go. The enemies will run up to you, but when they get within striking distance they suddenly start walking really slow, giving you some time to aim and shoot.  If you get a headshot, the enemy will flinch and give you a few seconds to walk up and do a roundhouse kick. The kick option is only available if the enemy is stunned and it’s not even that strong, but what’s important is that it will knock the guy down so you can run over and stick him a few times with your knife. This is something you will absolutely have to master, because ammo is scarce enough in the game that you’ll need to use as little as possible on each enemy.\n\nSpeaking of ammo, you have limited inventory space to store ammo for all of your weapons. In fact, inventory space will probably limit your choices in weapons more than cost, because if your inventory is filled with guns, you won’t have space for ammo, grenades, and healing items. Throughout the game you’ll get the opportunity to buy more inventory space, but it never gets comfortably large. You’ll always have to pick and choose what you want to keep and what to sell.\n\nPros:\n+Spooky environment, an engaging story, and an assortment of creepy enemies to fight, from the slow moving villagers to the giant bosses.\n+There’s a lot going on in this game: puzzle solving, running for your life (with quick time events), and mini games such as a shooting range. All of which adds up to a long and entertaining game.\n+There are a couple of bonus games in there after beating the main campaign. You can play as Ada Wong in 2 short campaigns that add a few more hours of gameplay. It took me about 24 hours to beat everything, though I may have spent more time than necessary killing every enemy I could find.\n\nCons:\n-The controls are really hard to get used to since the mouse look is so slow and you cannot move while aiming your gun. Speaking of which, it’s sometimes annoying how weak your guns seem. \n-While playing the Ada campaign, the game’s movie cutscenes are really, really low quality. It’s a technical issue, but if you’re playing the game in 1080p and suddenly one of the movie cutscenes occur, you’ll wonder what the hell happened to your screen.\n\nOverall, the game is worthy of your time, and if you plan on playing Resident Evil 5 and 6 after, you should probably play RE 4 to know what’s going on with Las Plagas and Leon. Be warned that the game can be quite difficult for new players on your first run through. Difficulty doesn’t affect Steam achievements, but you cannot change the difficulty during the game unless you keep dying in the same place, and the game asks if you want to try easy mode.\n",Recommended
"A dumb and fun action game that has been able to hold up for being over 10 years, Resident Evil 4 was quite the player in creating a solid controling 3rd person shooter, as there are many weapons to use from the more expensive magnums to rocker launchers to a burst fire pistol after finishing the game and more. While its game play handles slow enough to feel like you know what you are doing wrong. \n \nOnce you do understand when you should relocate, reload and switch weapons makes it seem like you can get around most of the obstacles that are thrown your way.   As for how the game looks visually should not be seen as much as a set back as most textures have not been replaceable and is a product of its time. \n\nThe amount of time you could spend in a single playthrough could take more then 16 hours with how you see more after the main game, it gives to you also side missions and a game mode called mercenaries that adds a survival mode to offer content after finishing the main game. \n\nVisuals: 4 out of 5\nGameplay: 4 out of 5\nLength: 5 out of 5",Recommended

"Resident Evil 4 takes the survival horror genre the Resident Evil series is most famous for and perfectly updates it with a modern camera, improved controls, and more action--without overdoing it. This is more than can be said of any RE title previous or since (mostly). I love how this game still reminds me of the originals: that dreaded feeling around every turn, never knowing whether you'll be able to survive the next onslaught or not. I believe the controls and camera are a nice touch which still don't make this game lose its challenge. This is one of the few titles where I can say the clunky and sluggish controls actually add to the gameplay and difficulty instead of crippling it. I consider RE4 to be the best RE game to date, though Resident Evil 7 may just be the first modern entry in the series to hold a candle to it.",Recommended

"Played it on the GameCube. Played it on Wii. Played it on PC.\nThis game changed Resident Evil and even if you don't like the new ones, this is just amazing.\nLike in other games the basic gameplay stays the same, but the environment and enemies vary in a nice and exciting way.\nDepending on the difficulty you choose, the game achieves the Recommended meaning of survival horror.\nYou don't shit your pants, but you may run like ""oh my god! oh my god! oh my god!"".\nSometimes your companion can be annoying, but most of the time they move smarter than companions in other games.\nThe checkpoints are kindly placed, so you can try to start the game on normal mode, even if you don't feel brave enough.\nThere isn't a huge selection of weapons, but later in the game you can choose between different pistols and rifles, which is a perfect amount for me.\n\nAll in all this game is pure fun. There are no game breaking bugs (I didn't experience any bugs at all) and the gameplay is fluent (no long loading screens, boring things et cetera).\nI recommend to play this game with a controller.",Recommended
"Although this game is a great one, and very well loved, I can't play it on here. It's not my PC, as I can play games like Skyrim on the highest settings and it runs fine. \n\nThat said, whenever I play this game, cut-scenes run fine, all menus work as they should, and all animations are smooth overall; however, the gameplay itself is playing in slow-mo... I don't know if this is due to being a port, or what, but, what I can say is that I can't recommend getting this game on PC. You're much better off getting another version of it, on its original release system, if you want to play it... \n\nI've re-installed and uninstalled multiple times, and as I said, can play high-end, more modern games on high graphics settings. I can't figure out why this game doesn't run at a decent pace. \n\nOh, and none of the dialogue is matching up with the cutscenes, either (they speak before the mouths move).",Not Recommended

"""She really pushed it.""- Leon\n\nResident Evil 4, I first played it on PS2 and it was good back then. Now, this game is great. It was ported well with refined graphics. It may not be as polished as modern games but this game can scare the crap out of you on your first playthrough. The puzzles are simple and impossible to miss. Levels are well made but some seem short. Bosses can be killed multiple ways but most of them have a quick or easy way to kill them. The story is entertaining, (not going to spoil anything here). Took me 18 hours first time on normal and then a little more than 12 on pro. \n\nOnly complaint is the quick time events. Capcom for what ever reason chose X and C keys as one of the options for QTE and some of these are unbelievably finicky. About half of my deaths were during QTE. Capcom pick keys that people actually use in the game.\n\nOverall good game, if you like horror and shooting.\n\n9/10 would Resident Evil again.\n\nEDIT: disabled background buzz sound.",Recommended
Very Recommended to the horror genre and a great buy worth the 20$,Recommended
"[b][i]""Luiiiiiiiiis!""[/i][/b]\n\nThis is only my second Resident Evil game (the first being Resident Evil Revelations), but I really enjoyed it a lot.\n\n[b]Story:[/b]\nThe story... didn't really make that much sense, but that's okay. You arrive at this small village where the president's kidnapped daughter has been spotted, but soon realize that something is wrong. When you find the girl, at first the bad guy says he plans to keep her for ransom. Then they need her for some kind of ritual. Sometimes they want you dead. Other times they just let you live. However, one thing that should be said about the story is that it really makes you (or at least me) want to play Resident Evil 5, 'cause it sort of ends on a cliffhanger.\n\n[b]Gameplay:[/b]\nComing straight from Resident Evil Revelations, it took me a while to get used to the way aiming worked in Resident Evil 4. At first I tried using a mouse and a keyboard, but that made controlling Leon really awkward, so I switched to my gamepad, which worked out much better.\n\nOn my first playthrough I just shot pretty much anything that moved, which led to me running low on certain types of ammo pretty often, but on my second playthrough I relied much more on my knife and melee attacks, resulting in me having to sell ammo because my inventory was full. Despite my second playthrough being on professional (hard), it felt much easier than my first playthrough, so the game might be a bit easy for some people. It [i]does[/i] have its hard parts though, and I died multiple times during certain (boss) fights. However, more often than not it was not me, but Ashley, our damsel in distress, who ended up dying. I thought she was suppose to be their precious hostage or part of some ritual or whatever, but apparently that doesn't mean that they won't kill her...\n\nAnd I'm not sure if some of the quick time/button mashing events in the game are bugged or not, but I spammed that X-button as fast as I could, and poor Leon still dropped down into the abyss. In the end I had to put my controller on the desk and just press the button as fast as I could using my index finger. Some people say that it might have something to do with the game not being optimized for 60 fps, which could certainly be the case.\n\n[b]Graphics:[/b]\nThe game is fairly old, but it still looks good to me. Certain parts of the environment/background look pretty bad, as does Leon when he is wearing his gangster outfit, but those are just minor details. Most of the enemies look good/creepy/silly/crazy, which is what's most important.\n\nOne thing that was a bit annoying though was that the game would slow down at times, making it feel like you are playing the game in slow motion. This seems to be a common issue, and while I did try some of the fixes posted on the forums, nothing worked. It made the game a bit easier than it should be (since you have more time to react to things), but it only happened a few times, so I just lived with it.\n\n[b]Music:[/b]\nThe music fits the mood pretty well, but as soon as you notice that [spoiler]creepy music = danger, no creepy music = safe[/spoiler], it sort of makes the game less scary.\n\nAlso, some of those voice actors/lines were pretty damn funny (even when they weren't suppose to be). ""Luiiiiiiiiiis!"" was my personal favorite, but ""Miiiiiiiiiiiike!"" was pretty great as well. Just not ""Leooooooon!""\n\n[b]Overall:[/b]\nOverall I enjoyed this game a lot, and although it was not as creepy/scary as Resident Evil Revelations, and also felt a bit easier, both of those Resident Evil games have been a hit for me. It took me about 20 hours to finish the campaign once (the difficulty didn't really make a difference), plus a couple of hours on the extra missions which you don't wanna' miss, so I can definitely recommend this game - even at full price.\n\n[url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/imthetoad/recommended/21690]Resident Evil 5[/url] Review\n[url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/imthetoad/recommended/222480]Resident Evil Revelations[/url] Review",Recommended

"Today's Review: Resident Evil 4 / Biohazard 4 HD\n\nNot a real review but more like a ""let's think for a moment"" review of this amazing game.\n\nDisclaimer: There are many reviews telling you the game is good or fun or not, so i'm gonna go with the assuption that you've read those reviews and know why you should or should't buy this game.\n\nLet's cut to the chase, The Plot: It's been 6 years since the Raccoon City incident and Umbrella has fallen, from that other companies have risen to provide the market and keep developing and selling the virus and in some cases modifing the virus to keep making more RE games. You step on the boots once again of Leon S. Kennedy, protagonist of Resident Evil 2, on Spain sent by the President of the United States to save his daughter that have been kidnapped, now here's the first thing i don't get, He's the President of the United States, the most powerful nation on earth and thenfore the most important person on earth, and when his daughter is kidnapped he sends a single man? for god's sake send several FBI teams! i mean they send Marines highly trained for hostage situations on Irak  and they are just regular ppl and you're sending a man alone to save the most important person in your life? I mean it's basically the same as let her die, and on top of that Leon during the game recieves little or no support to acomplish this great goal of saving her, only Hunnigan during the first 2/4 of the game and 1 chopper nearly the end, this was the first problem with the plot, the second problem comes with the actual plan of Saddler. Saddler had as a plan to kidnap the president's daughter (which i recon must be pretty difficult considering who she is and pretty easy considering how much the president has put in to save her) Infect her with ""Las Plagas"" a host/master parasite that renders the mind useless and takes control of the body of the host, being Saddler the master, so essentially his plan to control the world or get money (as Leon is told) it's to send her back to his father's arms and infect the president with this ""Las Plagas"", now here's what i think, when Saddler knew leon was in to save her, would't be the best option to let him save her and then, when she returns to his father, make more believable than sending her back by ""good will"" instead of trying to kill Leon and maybe Ashley during the course of the game? I mean are all the Ganados really stupid ? If you let Leon rescue her without telling Leon your plan, he might think everything's ok, she will go back to her's father, infect him with the parasite and then the president himself will be a minion of Saddler, instead he hires Mercenaries such Krauser or even the bosses like Salazar to kill Leon and ""return her"" to his father, would that be really suspcious? am i overlooking this? i mean if you played the game this are really good questions.\n\nObviously for this to actually be a game with good guy and bad guy the plot it's overlocked, it's a really good game so enjoy it!",Recommended

"Some people say this game ruined the Franchise, I disagree that title goes to RE5 even though RE5 is still a great game in it's own way but anyway onto the review: \nThe Game does take away the Survival Horror routes but I think this was the last Recommended Resident evil game as it still had some classic Resident evil moments which the future Resident evils took away until the Revelation series.\n\nAshley is also a great addition to the game, some people might disagree with me but I loved protecting her not once did she do anything stupid when I played the game, the boss fights are unpredictable as well, you don't know when a Quick time event is going to happen which comes to my last point.\n\nThe Quick Time events can go die in a hole, they refuse to work properly half the time even though I was clicking the right keys, the main issue happens in Chapter 4-4, the QTE there was just enough to almost make me rage quit but thank god I didn't as the rest of the game is pure amazing.\n\nNot only do you have the main game but when you finish the game you also unlock extra content such as playing 5 chapters about what Ada was doing during RE4, a non canon game mode where you play as Ada again retriving 5 Plaga samples, this game mode can be frustrating but is still fun and also The Mercenaries which is where some people spend most of their time but I really don't like The Mercnaries that much in this game it is so much better in RE5 because of the Co-op.\n\nGet the game, I really wish I could just play it for the first time again :(",Recommended

"[h1]Resident Evil 4 is easily the pinnacle of the Resident Evil series.[/h1] Gone are the fixed camera angles and excessively limited inventory space. What’s new is a wider array of weapons, with meaningful choice as to which you use and how you upgrade them. Everything good about Resident Evil is present. Wouldn’t be Resident Evil without some hilariously bad dialogue however. Witness:\n\nSalazar: [i]Aww… what a touching moment we have here.[/i]\nLeon: [i]All spoiled thanks to your interruption. Why don’t you do us all a favor and leave before the audience gets pissed off?[/i]\nSalazar: [i]You’re nothing but an extra in my script, so don’t get too carried away. Your biggest scene is over.[/i]\nLeon: [i]I don’t ever remember being a part of your crappy script.[/i]\nSalazar: [i]Well then, why don’t you show me what a first-class script is like, through your own actions.[/i]\n\nWow. Such meta. Very writing. Leon would be great at Cinema Sins!\n\nThe boss fights go to 11. A weird drunk guy that follows you around and sells you all the stuff you need is cool, sense be damned. Kneecapping not-zombies and roundhouse kicking them is the bee’s knees. My favorite Resident Evil staple, getting into the creepy secret laboratory, and discovering there are worse monsters yet, is back with a vengeance, yay Regenerators! Reaction time mini-games during the cut-scenes are wicked. The laser hallway was so good they made it into a movie. The arcade-style Mercenaries bonus mode has surprising replayability.\n\nI found the gameplay for the Tomb Raider reboot to be pretty similar. Tomb Raider does it better, but RE4 did it first. Both feature over-the-shoulder camera angles, customizable weaponry, contextual interaction with enemies, reaction-time mini-games, and an adventurous AAA single player experience, although Tomb Raider has more open-exploration. So if you liked that, or were a Resident Evil fan but haven’t played this yet, it’s a must-play.\n\nPort quality is good. Only a few cut scenes during the main storyline missed the HD treatment (And the extra Assignment Ada and Separate Ways). I can say this version is the best release after playing it on GameCube and the Wii. Only peasants aim with joysticks. Wiimotes were a gimmick. Keyboard and mouse are the control scheme of choice.\n\nThe only downside is this game is unrealistic: Mind controlling parasites? Ok. Infinite healing via herbs? Standard video game logic, I dig it. Government sends a single dude that doesn’t speak Spanish to track down the missing Princess in a castle in Spain, and murder half the country? Well I suppose, Congress has done worse. Ashley says “So, after you take me back to my place, how about we do some… overtime?” Sorry, the President would have two grandkids before that sentence ends.\n\n5/5 would get high out of my skull on magic brownies and run around the village at night again.",Recommended
"My Fab game from reisdent evil games. \nI'm happy it was given to HD when I play 100's of hours on the ps2 version.\nWhen it become HD though I feel that Dark atmosphere is gone and that resident evil feel of survival and horror is pretty gone. It looks like your playing an average third person shooter. \nYou do have the choice to pick HD or not so you can get the feel of what the game used to be so It's not that bad but I Think the atmosphere Is what makes Resident Evil special in background.\nBecides that. the game is amazing. 3 Main areas Village,Castle and Island (sounds dull but that's the names)\nOne bad part about this game I think Many would agree is Ashley. A whiny, annoying little girl that everytime she's in danger, it sounds like she dropped her milk at school. over half way of the game, Leon on his own and that's the shine of this survival Horror, not a girl piggy backing you.",Recommended
"Resident Evil 4 is kind of a monumental piece of game design... Released in 2005 for the GameCube exclusively to ridiculous critical, and fan acclaim, it sort of redesigned what we as gamers conceived of as a third person survival shooting experience. Now, this is shit that I'm assuming you already know, so what's the point of me telling you? Well, everyone has an opinion, and this is mine. In the past, the series of resident evil was known for its gripping horror, tense moments, and difficult puzzles all wrapped up in a maze like open ended game environment where the player could easily get lost. It was in these feelings of loss that the player could feel the foreboding environments, and tense distant groans of the ceaseless hordes of flesh eating zombies. And all these individual things that sum up to a gripping survival experience are completely thrown out the window with Resident Evil 4. Now don't get me wrong, Re4 is a fantastic gaming experience, and to me is akin to injecting visual heroine into myself, if you catch my meaning. But, I can't help but feel it misses the mark completely on what made the past games so great. Now, it is of course a re-inventing of the series, and I understand and appreciate that completely, but that doesn't mean it was done right. For example; save for the Regenerating lab experiments, the game is completely devoid of fear. At no point was I ever afraid of this game. And it didn't help that it was so self-aware. In the past RE games, yes, there was a B movie campy horror aesthetic. But, I to this day, am not sure if that was intentional, or just because of a lack of budget. RE4 intentionally lets itself known that ""Hey I don't fucking take myself seriously, and neither should you!"" It's downright laughable at times, and it knows and accepts it. The first time I beat this game, I think I was ten years old. And I don't remember ever feeling scared of it. Whereas RE2 back in the day, I couldn't even play for more than 20 minutes without cowering in a corner, clambering for the reset button on my PS1. At the end of the day, Resident evil 4 has allot to offer to players, with its memorable campaign, perfection of the mercenaries mode, and incredible amount of unlockable content. But it's just not resident evil, it sort of has its own identity to me separating it from the rest in the series. This is a great decade defining game that should be played by all self-acclaimed ""gamers"" no matter your age or gender, it just unfortunately misses the mark on the fear aspect making it the beginning point of the downhill slope of resident evil games as we know them today.",Recommended

"As someone who's only fully completed RE5 and not the other games in the series, it's clear to me that RE5 drew most of its inspiration and gameplay from RE4. Slow-walking enemies, clunky yet functional aiming mechanics, etc. It's very well paced, with boss battles and puzzles just where they need to be. Enemies have ranging HP levels, with some dying in one well-placed headshot and others surviving up to 5+ headshots. It's a brilliant game mechanic that keeps you on your toes. \n\n My main gripes with the game is that Ashley's AI is terrible (she can climb up ladders just fine but needs my help to descend ladders? wut), and the game giddily tosses 9mm handgun ammo your way while very rarely giving you ammo for all the other weapons. Buying ammo from the in-game merchant isn't possible, so it doesn't make much sense to use anything but a highly upgraded pistol, imo. \n\nIt's anxiety-fueling, tense action, not necessarily pants-pissingly horrifying, but still a blast to play.",Recommended

It's so old school that is awesome and I loved the characters Leon,Ada... Well Ashley was a bit annoying and the other didn't have that much character but I dont care. I loved everything about it except ashley or as I like to call her ""Mary jane 2.0"". I have played like 15 minutes of 5 and I already hate it but forget about that. Resident evil 4/biohazard 4 is an awsome game and I think you will like it :) 8.5/10.",Recommended
i really love this game but its too laggy and the fps is up to 60 and the lowest is 30. I cant play it because its slow and i have a pretty good pc so it should not be doing that.

"A snake drops Chicken eggs - Capcom Logic - would play again \n\nResident Evil 4 is a survival horror game. It was first released in 2005 which makes it more then 10 years old, yet it still looks great \n\n[b]Gameplay[/b]\n\nIt is a port from consoles to a PC - second one. I played both, first one and this and I can say that this one is much better. Although controls can feel still sort of clunky, weird but bareable. Aiming is what you'd expect from console port... it is ""consolish"" at first it may feel really, really weird but after some 15-20 mins people will get used to it (whilst playing on mouse).As for the gameplay itself, for me game ran smoothly expcept for several occurances (reloading sniper rifle, some boss fights) when there was stuttering and drop in FPS rate, now that just might be me... eitherway it wasn't a big deal. The game is not that scary for those who are comming for horror factor. There are few times when you get scared but they are rather scarse... although if you are like me and get scared by sounds of weird breething and scary music, you ll be satisfied well enough. What I really enjoyed were Boss fights as they are each very different, there is wide enough range of enemies and changes in locations. What can get kinda annoying is protection of one NPC but that is only during few parts of one chapter if I remember correctly (thank god). There is wide range of weapons to choose from and upgrades (YAY!) for said weapons which makes gameplay and managing your money fun. You'll also need to look for hidden treasures and manage your ammo smart as it can be scarse at times. During the 5 chapters you'll encounter some 10 puzzles, some are fun, some are less so. Overall game plays nice and hours pass fast while you play, you'll enjoy your dose of cheesy lines and puns, tough macho proclamations by your characters and foes, few WTF moments and a lot of fun while shooting zombies heads off. \n\n[b]Graphics[/b]\n\nAs I stated before, the game is about 10 years old so don't expect miracles, some textures look good some don't. Overall I think that the game aged rather well, and gameplay makes up for the aging of the graphics anyways. What does look weird and goofy at times are explosions, those just don't look like explosions at all... it looks more like yellow bubble than explosion. But that is just small detail, I don't expect people are going to buy decade old game in expectation of graphics spectacle. \n\n[b]Extras[/b]\n\nOutside of a main ""campaign"" or story mode, game offers several minigames that can keep you entertained for few more ours. Two of minigames are sort of mini campaigns, the third is sort of arcade stile game, where you play on maps from main game and you need to collect as much points as possible from killing zombies while under time limit. By playing these game you can unlock new costumes for characters in the game and more characters for the arcade style ""mercinaries"" game. \n\n[b]Summary[/b]\n\nOverall if you enjoy console games, bit of action, bit of horror, 3rd person shooter and boss fighting I would not hesitate to buy the game, although I would recommend to do so, if its on sale as full price seems a bit much.  [b]7.5/10[/b]",Recommended

"Resident Evil 4, is actually the Sixth game in the Resident Evil series and was released in 2005. Resident Evil 4 is a Third-Person shooter/Horror game where you play once again as Leon Kennedy, the protagonist from Resident Evil 2, who is on a mission from the President of the United States to rescue his kidnapped daughter from a group of cultists. Upon arriving at a local village you encounter townspeople who worship and are infected by a virus called, Las Plagas. Not to go further into the plot, Resident Evil 4 takes place Six years after the events at Racoon City. \n\nResident Evil 4 has won many awards and has been an influence for other, more modern games. Even though it is starting to show it's age when compared to newer titles, Resident Evil 4 is still a good playthrough. I recommend if you enjoy the Resident Evil series, or horror/shooters in general to give Resident Evil 4 a playthrough. The story is interesting and furthers the canon of the overall Resident Evil Universe. \n\n",Recommended
"Part of me wanted to thumb this port down. It seems like one of those cases where they took a console version and put it on Steam. Even though I have the required specs and then some to run this game, I have horrendous slowdown and I'm forced to play on a really low resolution. It's a pity because I already own this game on PS2 and was looking forward to playing the game with enhanced visuals.\n\nPros: What can I say? This is in my honest opinion, the greatest survival horror game ever made. The atmosphere is eerie, the story and characters make you feel invested, there's lots of weapons and upgrades, and enough extra content to make this one of the most replayable games I've ever owned. I've replayed this game more times than any other game I've ever owned, and I bought it on Steam just to do it all again.\n\nCons: As stated above, this port is running as if it were optimized for console. A lot of developers seem to take this shortcut alot, especially Rockstar. The problem with this is that consoles run games differently than PCs do. It's like trying to run a mac product on a windows system. It just never works.\n\nWould I reccomend this? Yes, but be cautious. The spec requirements aren't 100% accurate it seems.",Recommended

I been trying to play the game but the walking and turning is very slow as if in slow motion even though play around with the mouse sensativity amd graphic settings.

"I played this on both Wii (rented) and Gamecube (bought later) initially.\nThis is a good port, but without a controller it feels even more awkward to control than it already is.\nThere's no good implementation of the inventory screen to keyboard and mouse, either. No mouse functionality in those menus. I have tried both. Mouse is way better for aiming control.\n\nRunning Ashley around sucks, but for a game that is literally a hostage rescue and escort mission, it pulls of the best example of it in gaming period.\n\nI like everything involved with the maps (And levels) and inventory system and design, especially finding and collecting weapons and treasures.\nThe antagonists and dialogue might be cheesy and poorly written, but who cares? It adds charm.\nEnemies start out basic and get more convoluted and crazy, as expected of the franchise.\nPuzzles are nearly non-existent, but there is still a good focus on paying attention to the environment to progress that I can appreciate.\nThere's a lot of variety here, and it's a well polished title.\n\nOne of the best, it's easy to say RE4 is good.\n\nI recommend this to people who have controllers and are fans of linear survival horror games.",Recommended

"Resident Evil 4 is hailed as one of the best games in the series, while I'll agree to say it's a really fun game with a lot of ways to play and has a diverse array of weapons and areas. However, this is where Resident Evil died, survival horror fell off here, there's elements of survival but horror? Pretty hard to have that considering the goofy dialogue and the areas you find and of course the bad guys.  \nNow I know some of you are already grabbing your KB to tell me just how tense the village was, yeah let's go past that part and now you're in a castle. ...Okay a bit weird, then you're in a volcano that's inside a castle...? The castle that has rooms where people are buried behind walls chasing you with tunnel diggers and then there's midget Napoleon...and the cartoon character that is Lord Saddler. \n\nIt's not scary, it's a tense cartoon at best. -THAT ALL SAID, it's gameplay, action and the corny nature of said game really makes for a fun time. I'm stating the above since I'm constantly told how immersive the game is when it's about as serious as a saturday morning cartoon, yes I played it at launch. Village was a bit tense with the atmosphere but that's about the best ya get. Now with that all said I really do like the game, just wanted to remind people who say best RE game they're crazy since if you play RE1-3, or the remastered 1 you'll see it was more about creepy puzzles and not dumb boss characters you exchange goofy dialoge with :P. This is where RE died, this is where another great game was made. But you've already downvoted this because your nostaliga lives in the village and not the nefarious volcano in the castle run by midget Napoleon. Fine, credit on the regenerators, they're pretty unnerving.  \n\nIn terms of gameplay it's really fun, some will find it hard to get around the tank like controls since you cannot aim & move at the same time, which makes for some tense moments and the game is built around it and managing what weapons to use when.\n\nIn terms of a port, 30/60 frame lock which is fine by me as long as that lovely 60 is an option. It's textures aren't what I'd call HD and it's missing some texture filtering that the Gamecube version had oddly. Also, it has a problem with windows 10 and apparently 8. The game after 10-15 minutes crashes, turns out you need to turn off your virtual keyboard for the game to work. Happened on both my machines and it was a BIT frustrating to trouble shoot such a dumb problem. The game however seems to run just fine at 720p/30fps on my surface pro 4 so that's RE4 on the go, which is great.\n\nI can't comment on the mouse controls, they looked terrible so I've been playing with controllers which works fine for me. As goofy as it is to say, this game was designed around a controller to make aiming more hard and the game more tense. \nVisually it's still pretty impressive considering it's age, I dunno where they get off saying it's a HD remake when textures are pretty poor, but overall it still looks great ...considering it's age. Varied locations and weapons, though you'll see the same 5 villagers for a while. \n\nShort version, great game worth playing, a lot of replay to be had in mercs mode and has some really fun moments despite being very goofy in the story/characters area.  Grab it if you haven't.",Recommended

"[h1] TL;DR Resident Evil 4 and its HD port onto Steam is great. For those that played the game back on the GameCube or PS2, everything is still here and better than ever. Those that are new, enjoy a game that is both action oriented, and horror inducing in all the best ways. [/h1]\n\n[ + ] [b]Gameplay[/b] is great. While common nowadays, back in 2005 the third person view with close in laser aim was revolutionary, and games like Dead Space and Evil Within owe thanks to this game. Something else I believed RE4 popularized was QTE's, which are used quite frequently throughout the game. I was never a fan of QTE's, and while this game had it's good ones, there were plenty of bad ones as well.\n\n[ + ] [b]Graphics[/b], like the gameplay, were amazing back in '05. That being said this game still looks great thanks to the HD port. 1080p with 60 FPS on top of HD textures really help the game look in its prime condition. Animations are also something I look for while playing games, and Capcom did a great job in making everything move and look like it should.\n\n[ + ] [b]Plot[/b] surprisingly good. Older RE games focused on two things, survive and escape. While RE4 doesn't mess with that formula, it does change it up some. Leon being tasked with rescuing the President's daughter, is on a hunt to find her in rural Europe, then find a way out once that task is completed. The main / side characters I found to be interesting, while a couple others do get annoying as the game goes on.\n\n[ + ] [b]Atmosphere[/b] holds Recommended to the RE games, and really brings in something new of its own from the very beginning. From woods, to villages, to castles, to an island, they all give off the same creepy vibe of something not being right. You'll encounter scary enemies, fight tough bosses, solve puzzles, and fight to stay alive. Keeping Recommended to the series.\n\n[ + ] [b]Sound[/b] is standard in this game. The guns sound good, enemies sound scary, and music is average. But the save room music in this game, like all RE games is so...mystic and mesmerizing. It’s hard to describe and really stands out that much to me, giving me an eerily safe feeling before heading back out into that dangerous unknown.\n\n[ + ] [b]AI[/b] is good. While Ashley's character is generally seen as an annoyance, she does well to stick close by you and never stray far when danger is close. That doesn't make her any less annoying, but, there's at least no unnecessary frustration. Enemies are actually pretty smart too. They'll move out of the way to avoid getting shot, and will dodge, leap, and climb to get to you.\n\n[ - ] [b]Puzzles[/b] got dumbed down this time around. This was intentional I believe, since the game was going more run and gun, rather than stop and think. There are quite a few puzzles in the game, but only two I found to be challenging. The rest involved simply finding an item or pushing a button to open whatever door / path that blocked the way.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[b] As a kid, this was the first horror game I managed to beat on my own. The reason behind that was because even though this game was scary to me, it was so fun I had to push through and finish it. I went on to beat it over 50 more times on my old GameCube version. A truly great game, and one that should be played by the avid gamer, along with the other classic RE games. [/b]\n",Recommended

"A bad game made even worse on the PC.\n\nI have tried to find what people see in this game over the years. I've owned the GC version for years and even progressed to the castle portion of the game...\n\nBiggest problem is the gameplay. It's just not good. Killing things is a total chore at best, and super hard at worst, because all of the enemies are huge bullet sponges. Aiming is a huge pain in the neck. People say to use melee but that's a terrible idea as getting close means a death sentence.\n\nThe damage weapons do is completely inconsistent as well. Sometimes you can kill things in 2-3 headshots. Sometimes it takes upwards of 7. Why is this? Because it's a terrible game, that's why.\n\nThe movement is awful. Leon moves like a drunkard. Walking in a straight line is hard because it's impossible to tell visually where he's facing due to the angle. Turning back and forth makes you move backwards.\n\nI always feel like I'm drifting off the path I'm trying to walk on, or I'm walking into walls. It's just not good.\n\nThis all makes the game hard for all the wrong reasons. The gameplay systems themselves hinder you into making it difficult. If you could move decently, or aim better, this game would be a complete joke. This is not good game design. I don't want to THINK about HOW to use the controls after playing a game for years. That shouldn't be the struggle. Clever enemy design, or level design should be, not the method of interacting with those design elements.\n\nAll of this is made worse somehow on the PC. Aiming is slightly better with a mouse, but only slightly. The camera is beyond broken on PC though. The camera never recenters, but the controls are character relative. This means if you move the mouse AT ALL outside of aiming mode then your camera is off kilter. You can tap the knife button to snap it back to center, but doing this in combat is SUPER disoreanting.\n\nThe sound design is awful, and it's basically a mono mix pumped to stereo. None of the sounds are character relative, so footsteps, or any sounds the enemy makes are all at full volume regardless of distance. This is far more noticeable on my PC than it was on my GC. But that's no excuse. The GC supported Dolby surround! You're telling me we can't get proper stereo audio mixes?\n\nAside from that it's got a terrible story that makes no sense, and it wanders off into tangents a lot.\n\nThe graphics are ok, and it ran fine though. I do have a 980 however, so take that with a grain of salt.\n\nAll in all I cannot warn people about this game enough. It's just a bad game, and the PC version is likely the worst way to play it anyway sadly. You'd think that mouse aiming would make this game a LOT easier, but no, it doesn't, the game is just broken.\n\nDo not buy this game. The fanboys are dead wrong. This is the game that killed the Resident Evil franchise.",Not Recommended
"While Resident Evil 4 manage to be another solid well produced title, you can see the \nchanges on the genre itself (from horror to action) but only on a healthy moderation.\n\nMinigames and treasure hunting are introduced in this title which does breaks the immersion a bit in a horror game. Also this is the turning point where the zombies are turning into armed infected with rocket launchers and gatling guns...\n\nStill, it manage to entertain me through the end with their spooky background music and atmosphere. Different sinister enemies are slowly introduced at different chapters which keeps me well entertained. The game length is long but perfect balanced which is very satisfying! You may need at least a day or two if you try to marathon it.

Dracula's minions apparently think the best way to deal with Ashley and Leon is to kill them. Despite the fact that this completely invalidates Dracula's plan. Some of Dracula's minions are cave trolls that he has imported from Middle-Earth...they must be the ones doing the planning that doesn't come directly from Dracula.

It's extremely unpleasant, and there's absolutely no reason for me to play this game for a third time if it has the worst controls of any platform.\n\nIt's too bad. I was really looking forward to this.\n\nYou may want to consider this game if you've never played it before, but play it with a controller. You will have a much better experience. The tank controls are endearing, at least to me, but playing it with WASD limits your turning speed to jerky twists that you have to tap-feather. It feels really bad, especially if you played the game before with a controller.\n\nAlso, do not buy this if you want to combine your mouse input with analog joystick input. It will not work. (Like the Steam controller. It simulates a mouse and an analog joystick to give you maximum precision.) The game developers saw fit to arbitrarily turn off input from the controller the moment you touch the mouse, so you will not be able to move and aim at the same time.",Not Recommended
"Even after all these years still a masterpiece!\n\nWhen I think of the perfect combination of old-school Resident Evil horror and the newer, more action-packed style, this is the one coming to mind. The story is...not very good, but the set pieces are quite enjoyable, the music very engaging and it's deeply atmospheric.\n\nUnfortunately I'm basing this review on the German version, which contentwise only includes Separate Ways.

"THIS IS MY REVIEW OF THIS GAME.\n\n\nGraphics.\nThe remastered version looks better than the original in many ways. Models, textures and all effects.\nOnly one problem. There is way too much FPS drops in a game with graphics like this. Especially in areas where is rain, water or many effects. This HAS to be fixed.\n\nGameplay.\nThe gameplay is very similar to the older Resident Evil games. Many people don't like this game for this kind of play style, but it's very fun and unique for me. Comparing to the older Resident Evil games the non-static camera changed EVERYTHING. It is way more fun to play. Sometimes it can be very frustrating to beat some puzzles or levels, especially on the hardest difficulty wich you unlock beating the game.\n\nSound.\nThe sound effects are quite good and well made, but sometimes it feels too empty. Nothing much to say about that.\n\nPlot and Story.\nPlot has changed alot, new virus, new country- Spain, new types of enemies that brings a whole new level to the Resident Evil franchise.\n\nOverall rating.\nA nice game to play when you are bored from the modern FPS and competitive games.\n\nI rate this game 9/10.",Recommended

"The definitive version of the game from a purely technical standpoint, and in my eyes one of the all-time greatest games ever made. Impeccable pacing, striking a perfect balance between player progression through equipment upgrades versus the challenge threshold of the game's scenarios. Fantastic ambience that feels equal parts dank and opressive but entertainingly cheesy. The keyboard+mouse controls trivialize much of the challenge of the game, so I recommend plugging in a gamepad. There are modernized options for gamepad control, allowing better use of a dual analog setup and the triggers -- I recommend going into the options menu and taking a look before diving deep.",Recommended

"This game started the branch off for Resident Evil. People say this is the best RE game out there... No, REmake of RE1 is the best. RE 6 is better than this, but people like sucking dick so much that they can't see past the crap they lube it up with. I hate people, I really do.\nI love RE4. I really do.\nI love RE6 more. I really do.\nI recommend it all. I really do.",Recommended
"What can I say about it?  It's influenced just about every game after it and does it better than most of them.  The game that introduced the over-the-shoulder camera that zooms in for aiming your gun, is this.\n\nThe game is the perfect action horror shooter.  It killed my favourite series, and I prefer the classics, but it is potentially the best single-player third-person shooter to date.  Something about the mechanics, they're so fine-tuned that everything is addictively rewarding.\n\nMechanics, now that brings me to an important point:  the game uses tank controls, which in 2005 none of us noticed actually, but apparently a lot of younger gamers find INSANE.  Poor sods.  Well, if you just try to get used to the controls, you'll find it is perhaps the most balanced combat system designed.  You see my 51 hours on record here?  That is the tiniest fraction of the time I've spent playing this game on various consoles.  Because every single enemy in the game is designed to use tank controls just like you, and it just works perfectly.\n\nThe game is on average a good 20-25 hours if you're not rushing, and is so wonderfully varied and evolving over the course of it, that the moment you're done playing it on Normal, you'll probably want to get going on Professional, and you absolutely should; the game is utterly different.  Professional changes several things, like enemy AI (dramatically), enemy placement, enemy health, and enemy damage.  Several surprises occur on professional that won't in Normal.\n\nBeyond that, Assignment Ada is a decent hour of play, and Separate Ways is at least five (can't remember, could be more).  And then there's Mercenaries.  On the surface a simple arcade game where you just kill things a lot.  But the majority of my time on record here has been spent in Mercenaries, and that's because when you have combat mechanics this good, you can really rely on them to carry something.  RE4 continues the RE tradition of fantastic mini-games that rival the main game in how engaging they are.\n\nThe story is more ridiculous than any RE before it and it's fantastically enjoyable.  Leon is like a caricature of the Hollywood action hero and it's hilarious.  Oh, and an RE's American main character is finally played by a person that isn't blatantly obviously Canadian, not that I cared before, because it was funny.  I don't know what kind of name is Osmond Saddler but I don't think it's Spanish.  Anyway, it has a story that keeps the game going despite being really really stupid.  It's charming.  You'll like it.\n\nPeople that are new to Resident Evil and see both this and the Resident Evil Remake remaster on Steam, they're utterly different games and styles.  The Remake is the Recommended survival horror style the series had from 1996 until 2003, and RE4 in 2005 is the first of the action style the series retains to this day (though RE4's atmosphere does horror really well, unlike later RE games).\n\nThat's the majority of what needs to be said.  I'll finish by saying that this port is good overall, but lazy as all hell when it comes to making it 'HD'.  Some people report problems that occur at 60fps which didn't occur in older versions at 30fps and can be solved by setting the game at 30fps, but I have had no problems in this regard (though the rifle animation is still at 30fps so it looks ridiculous).  However, the Recommended HD mod that's coming out looks glorious and worth getting this port for, if it's HD you're looking for.\n\nAdditionally, the gamepad controls work really great in my opinion, though I do not appreciate having to use a mod if I want to change the configuration, and a lot of people say the keyboard and mouse controls are great.  My one problem is that the right analogue stick appears to have only the four cardinal directions as opposed to Recommended analogue or even an eight-way directional system.  I never felt weird using it in any other version and I've played them all.\n\nThat's it.  10/10, buy it unless you're a closed-minded bell-end and you really can't bear the thought of a control system that's mildly differernt to the one you like, or if you really hate action games (although even there, I know people that don't love action games that were won over by this game because it's that good).  Buy it.",Recommended
"Really wanted to give this game a try but its must be just too old for me, the aiming is so horrid and just trying to walk around is so difficult, trying to use the controls is the hardest part of the game lol. i guess thats what to be expected with pc ports, might be a decent game if u have a controler",Not Recommended
"[h1]Simply perfect[/h1]\n\nI have been playing RE4 since 2005, and ten years later this game still kicks major a$$.\n\nVery involved storyline, great soundtrack, an assortment of dope weapons, and groundbreaking visuals for its time. If you played the original PC version of this game (and you know how crappy it was), you will feel compensated with this HD remaster.\n\nThe graphics are now more crisp, and trading cards along with achievements are a nice'n'sweet cherry on top of the cake. Having played this on the PS2 most of my life, the default joystiq controls for PC seemed quite uncomfortable, however installing a mod by DarkSamus fixed everything like a charm, so no problem there.\n\nTo conclude,  this is a very solid game with loads of things to do, very solid HD remaster, and the price tag on this is more than reasonable. This game will please both Resident Evil and other action shooter fans alike.\n\n[b]10/10[/b]",Recommended

"It looks and runs well, but the changes to the controls that make it more comfortable to play with a keyboard and mouse completely break the game when using a controller. For an example, movement and aiming should be on the same input, but on PC they split it, so you will be moving with the left stick, and aiming with the right. The same is for shoot and action, which should both be the same input, but are split up. This is my favorite game of all time, so it makes me very frustrated that Capcom was so close to releasing the perfect version of Resident Evil 4, only to take a huge step backwards. If you care about controller support at all, avoid this port. If you want to play RE4 in HD, buy it on PS3 or Xbox 360, or better yet emulate it on GCN/Wii.",Not Recommended

The aiming system was revolutionary, has a good deal of enemies, varied locations, a bit of item management and tons of action.

The various weapon types play quite differently, and you will end up choosing your favourite few, meaning that everyone will find a style of play that suits them the most.\n\n It's the kind of game that keeps you on the edge of your seat, and you will gladly play it again and again.

It was not as complete as the gamecube or ps2 version. So if you have played this game before, there will be some spots you won't have to deal or go through with. Though it takes away from the gameplay slightly. There is a UP SIDE!!!! Most of the sections that weren't implemented were the most annoying parts, in my mind anyways.\n\nFor those who are new to this game and are worried you won't get the full experience.

"This seems to be one of the better RE titles.  It doesn't rely heavily on jump scares but creeped me out for most of the game.  I rarely felt safe as I tried to conserve health items and ammo.  I easily spent 8 hours straight during one session alone, almost unknowingly as it really kept my attention.  Leon is definitely a tolerable protagonist in this, and I remember him from RE2 which I played a lot of back near its release.  Looking forward to trying out the next two sequels, though as I understand they pale in comparison as this one has been rated highly across the board.  The graphics are dated (this was originally a Wii title) but do the job well.\n\nMy only gripe to be honest are the mouse controls which take some geting used to as the camera always snaps forward when I try to move.

The revolver and sniper rifle animations alone are enough to buy this game.\n\nADVICE: check out re4hd(dot)com. There's a fan project going on right now to completely retexture this game.

"Why this game sucks:\n\n- action over horror with no tension or build up \n- weak plot, there's a moment in the game where the protagonist gets infected by a virus but it doesn't effect him at all through out the entire game. He conveniently finds a cure in the last act. Creators could have done something interesting with the idea of infection but didn't. No hallucinations, sanity effects or crippled gameplay\n- unlikable characters, Capcom is obsessed with Leon Kennedy, there's too much of him in the Reisdent Evil franchise and the company always forcefully tries to make him interesting.\nI enjoyed every minute he didn't speak in the game.\n(also, his hair looks stupid but that's just my opinion) \n- boring enemies with some boss exceptions\n- I wish the creators put zombies in this game, because most of the monsters suck\n- you can't move while aiming a weapon in 2014 and the controls had not been updated to today's standars which would help this game a lot\n- Resident Evil 4 is a huge departure from the series' core, it should have been announced as a spin-off and it almost destroyed what made Resident Evil great in the first place\n\nThe conclusion:\n\n- Resident Evil: Revelations, its sequel and classic Resident Evil games HD remaster editions are a step in the right direction.

"I didn't play this when it was originally out, so I have no nostalgia for this game, thus I think I can approach it relatively unbiased.\n\nTo start, the PC Port is rocky at times. Even though most hardware people are running nowadays dwarfs the systems this game originally came out on, there are still some oddities. Even though I was able to get 60fps flat on most areas of the game, anywhere with intense fog or fire would drop me down to 15fps. The game needs to stay locked to a multiple of 15 as well, which is strange, but considering this was never designed to be a PC game I can excuse it. I had to really struggle through some foggy areas in the middle of the game, but other than those few areas, my currently 2009ish build kept up at full details in 1080p.\n\nI actually had a fantastic time with this game overall, despite a few bumps. The design is unique, and while it feels clunky at first, you eventually get used to how the gunplay is designed and the overall flow of the game. There are some encounters in the game that feel luck-based and unfair, however, and while they are annoying to get through, it is possible. I also don't particularly enjoy some of the luck-based randomness the game has to offer with healing items and ammo, and I found myself more than once hoping and praying for some ammo drops. A few times, I ran out of ammo for most weapons, but I recovered eventually.\n\nThis is also a really good game to approach with a beforeiplay-style guide to it. There are some relatively bad mistakes one can make that can sort of cripple you later in the game, and I'm actually really glad I didn't go in totally blind.\n\nAfter you beat it you unlock a couple more modes to play if you feel the need to extend your gameplay.\n\nOverall, definitely worth it if you pick it up in a bundle or cheap in a sale, and I can see why this game got high accolades many years ago. It still stands up to these accolades, for the most part.",Recommended

"I think this review is worth reading, I'm not gonna go super in depth as I can't be bothered and am about to play some Left 4 Dead 2 with a friend who is waiting for me. Sorry its a huge wall of text, but I think its helpful, so please read.\n\nHello, let me first start off saying I've only just got up to a boss where I need to gather 3 isignias. The boss is called ""Trousers"". Anyway, I was ready to give this game a 10/10 on my first run through on Normal. I think I'll give it an 8.5 because the gameplay has really annoying Quick Time Events that have really frustrated me. If you're good enough at quick time events, by all means get this game I recommend it to anyone. The god damn *SPOILERS* Mine cart ending jump, crowser knife cutscene and crowsers boss fight are the places I've wasted an hour replaying over and over because I couldn't mash the X button or whatever quick time event it was. It's so annoying. The atmosphere in this game is great. It's not as scary as I had hoped for but that's because my first ever horror game was Amnesia: The Dark Descent. However this game is quite great at the scares it gives, there are these enemies close to the end of the game that I believe everyone who's played this game knows about and thinks that the game deserves a great horror rating. Eh, I think the game's more of a thriller than horror, but I think that's because the older games were less action related. Anyway I decided to write this review at first because the god damn quick time events irritated me. But I guess I'll make this a full review, as far as replay value goes I can't tell because I'm just really close to the finally of the game, but the first game alone is enough for the money I spent. I'd even pay full retail price for this game, maybe a little less because of the quick time events, but I'll let that slide.. a bit. You play as this cool hunk of a ladies man called Leon. He's pretty cool, he seems to be the most athletic person who ever decided to join any military or whatever. He's a secret agent and has cool hair. Anyway the gameplay's pretty good enough, people say that the controls are tanky, but they're less tanky than I expected when I went in and played it. I guess it's because i played with my mouse and keyboard though. The story is pretty cool, and the back story behind the mutants/monsters/LOS PLAGAS PANTAS is interesting. It's a great all around game that becomes great because it's so thrilling the more you get into it. Like I said I wasn't too afraid of anything really except some enemies near the end of the game, who I know anyone who's played this before will know about. But not that much. Either way this game is none the less an amazing one and I think anyone should have it in their steam library. I'm looking forward to getting Resident Evil 5 and 6 next time they go on sale, maybe Christmas. Also don't listen to all the crap people keep saying about ""OHH THE NEW RESIDENT EVIL GAMES ARE SO LAME, ITS JUST LIKE COD YOU AREN'T AFRAID AND RUN AND GUN"", those people are disgusting and really immature. The new resident evil games are just as fun, if not MORE fun to play because they're more modern. But it's just not going for as much horror as it used to, it's going for more great production valued pieces. Which by all means if it's a great game, you're welcome to gimme some. Anyway, that's my review. Sorry it's not really good, I'm in a bit of a rush and just wanted to talk to someone and give my feelings on the game. Resident Evil 4, for me, is a 8.5/10 with my ""Spartan must have"" badge of approval that I just made up right now as I remembered AngryJoe having a ""Badass seal of approval"". Take care everyone, be good and follow your dreams, you beautiful people.",Recommended
"RE4 holds a special place in my gaming heart. Played it since it first came out on the Gamecube. Seeing it here on Steam with an HD touch, who could resist? As awesome as the game looks with all high settings, it has many bugs. First off, it plays in slow motion. This is easily fixed by configuring the FPS limit within the games files. But now a nother problem emerges. I can't kick a door open. I can slowly push the door open but god forbid you kick it! Your foot will kick nothing, instead it'll go through the door granting you no access into the room until you step back and slowly push it open. Why hasn't this been fixed? The game is playable but these bugs are distracting. I'd recommend getting this on PS3 instead, atleast until these issues are fixed which i doubt will happen without a 3rd party mod.",Not Recommended

"Almost unplayable. I love Resident Evil story but i'm considering quit trying to play this. \n\nThis is it, if you're looking for the winner on ""who can remake with the minimun effort a game plus turn it into the WORST PC port ever"" contest, you got it.\n\nIt continuously crashes at random points (and it is NOT because of minimun specs despite what some are arguing, trust me). Its textures are poor (definitely not HD). \n\nAnd gameplay, well... I get it, you thought it would be unfair if we could handle character better than a tetraplejic duck (that is how I feel when i try to use a gamepad to play a game), but some of the game key mechanics are just hilarious.\n\nThanks for hours of frustration, and desperation, investigating in forums trying to solve your flaws (damn, how is possible so many people are getting this to work, and yet, nobody has still solved why it randomly crashes in my case?? NO, its not the FU***NG antivirus and its not a FU***NG RAM problem!!).\n\nSo, let me be clear: skip this, go directly to RE6, THAT is an awesome port.\n\nPD: I don't suffer OCD. Still, each time i see ""resident evil 4 / biohazard 4"" in my library I cry blood. You didn't even BOTHER to correctly write the DAMM name of your game? Is it more expensive to use f***ng capitals?",Not Recommended
"Old school classic for me. Played this as a kid and beat it multiple times, and still had to buy it for the PC. This ones a favorite by many resident evil fans. \n\nIf you haven't played this.. Naa naa there's no way that'd be possible. Add it to your collection of PC games. It's definitely worth it. (Wish list, then wait for sale if your like me) I couldn't pass up this game when I got that sale notification.\n\nLike I said though great game, 3rd person. Might take some new ppl a sec to get the feeling of the aiming but it's truly not that hard (aiming) also the length of the game is proper. Not to long not to short and the story lines good, along with after you beat it you get extra modes unlocked which pulls you right back in. (& you get to keep all your previous inventory) so that's no tedious working for the same guns you had last profile type deal.\n\nADD THIS TO YOU COLLECTION OF PC GAMES!!!!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[quote=wbacon capcom]Hi there -\n\nJust creating a separate, sticky thread for higher visibility regarding crashes.\n\nThrough our official beta patch threads, we've been advising users to temporarily turn off the anti-virus software if they experience consistent crashes in sections such as the Ch. 3-1 castle water room and Ch. 1-3 swamp area.\n\nHere's a recent [url=http://steamcommunity.com/app/254700/discussions/0/558752450704658013/#c558752450794413141]example[/url] from a user who use BitDefender:\n[quote=DarkRoad09;558752450794413141]Problem fixed. no crash in the castle so far.

[/quote]\n\nAnd  here's a snip from the official beta thread:\n\n[h1]Reproducible Crashes[/h1]\nIf you are experiencing crashes repeatedly in the same area (such as the swamp area), there is a chance that your anti-virus software may be deleting important game files or simply preventing the game from accessing certain files.  If so, please try the following steps in order to isolate the issue:\n\n1) Disable or temporarily shut down the anti-virus software\n2) Open Steam client, right-click on Resident Evil 4 from Library, and select Properties\n3) Click Local Files tab and select 'Verify integrity of game cache...""\n4) Once the verification process completes, launch the game and verify if the crash still occurs (make sure to keep the anti-virus software turned off during this test)\n\nPlease also check the following two Steam Support articles which covers crashes as it relates to anti-virus software and other 'hidden' Windows processes that may interfere with the game and/or Steam client.\n\n1.

"Maybe it was better in it's time.  Maybe it's better on console/ with controller.  Personally, I find it very disapointing considering how much I loved RE2 back in the day.  I just picked this up on a sale having not played any of these titles in what, 15 years?  This one made it just over an hour before hitting delete.  The controls are terrible, pretty much unplayable really, and I don't see how a Dpad could help that.  The lack of strafe, shoot while moving, sprinting, and jumping... it plays badly and feels gimped at best.  You are locked in to an environment in ways that are obviously forced, your movement is awkward, you can't respond to combat properly at all... It is set up like a FPS with no FPS movement.  It's not FPS though, it's 3rd person, but with no cameral control.  This makes no sense at all as it limits your vision because you are in your own way on top of not being able to move properly.  It kills all sense of immersion and makes it difficult and nauseating to try to play.  On top of all that there are issues like killing a whole group of mobs and a cut scene triggers, and then when you are returned you are in a different spot, walk back to where you were (again, no sprint), only to JUST miss picking up all the loot because it times out and vanishes for no reason because of the time the game wasted for you.  Hopefully the later titles in the series I got in the bundle fixed these problems, this one is a fail.",Not Recommended

"This is the last game of the series that I call to be a great success. One of the few games that I've ever considered replaying twice and I've thoroughly enjoyed my time by doing so (and I rarely take to mind playing single player games). I'd say that RE5 isn't all too bad thanks to the implemented CO-OP, but it isn't nowhere near RE4's ambience. So...\n\nRE4 has both its creepy, and sweaty moments. The atmosphere in this masterpiece is quite striking and it meets all the requirements to be called a horror game (I was quite creeped out when I first laid my hands on it quite a bunch of years ago, but after a few hours of gameplay, it wasn't all that bad). The textures were refreshed and the game was given a much more polished look ever since. Yes, you won't find Nvidia Physx or 2015 year graphics here, but the game looks great even without those enhancers. \n\nConsidering the story, then I'll outright say: there wasn't a moment in the game, which I found to be boring. Maybe save for some short phases with Ashley. Everything went so smooth, I lost the orientation in time during my second playthrough. It took me almost 17 hours to beat the game on normal without skipping a pixel. It has its 'Press ""X"" to shoot the dynamite' moments, but at least here you have to press 2 buttons instead of one! A big difference, I know. You will encounter characters from the previous series; someone took a different path, someone didn't change at all.\n\nEnemies in this game are able to dodge and duck from your attacks and such a thing can be witnessed the farther you progress through the plot (not to speak of the parasites that give them a second wind). The amount of ammo gives you that feeling where you have to be conservative and follow the cliche ""SHOOT THE ZOMBIE IN THE HEAD"", otherwise you might run out of it really fast. Bosses in the game are diverse and require different approaches. You can upgrade the weapons of your choice and unlock their special traits after the full grade. As long as you don't waste your money on upgrades for every single weapon you bought, then you shouldn't have problems with them; also, highly consider finding all those secrets hidden on the maps, otherwise you might find yourself in a desperate penury.\n\nTo summarize it all:\n\nPROS:\n+ Entertaining story;\n+ Immersive atmosphere;\n+ Rather challenging difficulty;\n+ Charismatic characters;\n+ Weapon upgrades;\n+ Bonus content after completing the game;\n\nCONS:\n- A very little amount of areas are badly optimized, giving you a solid drop in FPS;\n- Ashley's voice gets annoying sometimes...\n\nI give this game a solid 10/10 without further ado. Go and get it.",Recommended

"When I was younger I remember shivering with anticipation at the mystery and atmosphere of Resident Evil 4. While flawed it was an engaging piece of entertainment, and I remember its nuances and creative design most favourably. This HD super-dooper remake, however, disappoints. My computer is not very powerful, but even with the overhead of an emulator can run the PS2 version well. This, however, runs like a rusty chainsaw even when lowered -below- PS2 version graphics specs. It lags horrifically seemingly at random, the performance is uneven, and the mouse support is poor. I am reminded of the catastrophe that was the original RE4 PC version. This would seem to be a reskinned version of that failure. For $30 I expected a proper remake, not more reskinned garbage like we've been seeing.\n\nI would appreciate, but do not expect, a refund and in future a new version of the program made available that is actually designed for PC and supports a mouse somewhat better.",Not Recommended

"so many years, so many consoles and versions, so freakin many playthroughs i cannot even count anymore... \n\none of the best games ever made, and even more noteworthy considering the state of video games when this was released. there were other games that seemed to do some things better, but this was and continues to be a real jewel. notice i don't misuse the phrase 'diamond in the rough', as so many numbskulls do these past several years, but symantics is a whole other subject. team fortress 2, for example, was a diamond in the rough 5 or 6 years ago, and it has since evolved to an online masterpiece. a diamond in its rough state, in other words, not a diamond among lesser things. but i digress...\n\nworth 20 bucks, though it can be had much cheaper if you have the knowledge about how to shop. buy it for 2 or 20, but buy it. i don't care as much about the remaster, as i am (ironically) using a 1024x768 monitor for the first time in a decade, but this version has everything and then some that has ever been included in a release of RE4. i do think the textures are better than before as well, despite my low res rendering, and it all does help some with immersion. honestly though, this game has a unique and brilliantly executed atmosphere that permeates the game world even when blurry textures were more of a standard thing in this game. \n\ni use and have always used a controller for this game. i guess use kb/m if that's your thing, but controllers are just the better way to connect to the world in most games, and this one is no exception. controls are as good as ever, and using xbox one controller is even another small step up, but that has nothing to do with the game directly... \n\nget this game if you dont have it, or if you want to revisit it, or if you want to prove that you are the one person in the world who isnt going to like it. nothing much needs to be said, and ive been rambling since i started this unnecessary review. everyone knows it's a marvelous game, now you can be sure i know it too.",Recommended

Between the clunky controls, the ever-present slowdowns regardless of whether you're running on 30 FPS or 60 FPS and regardless of how good your computer may be, and the gamebreaking crashes on Windows 10 that make it literally impossible to continue through the game, it's just not worth your $20.\n\nIf you're really looking to play RE4 again, or even for the first time, get it on the PlayStation Store.

"So where to start. The game is Resident Evil 4. It's now a decade old. It's the game that took a drastic shift in gameplay from its original fixed camera survival horror predecessors, and to many it was a revolutionary step for the Third Person Shooter genre.  It’s an incredible game in itself and I enjoy it so much more than many of the games today, but arguably some of the mechanics have aged over time. It’s also where all the problems began leading up to its less popular sequels.\n\nResident Evil 4, while having an eerie horror like atmosphere, is by no means ‘scary’. Previous installments left you very vulnerable (a common trait in Survival Horrors) with scarce ammunition and weaponry. Resident Evil 4 isn’t really a Survival Horror so to speak, it’s more like an action adventure game with a horror setting. And that only counts for 2/3rds of the game until it diverts from that atmosphere. After that once you get to the island, it turns into an action game. Leon is practically armed to the teeth as a one man army by the time he reaches Salazar’s castle and ammo is so plentiful that you have to be a complete dunce to run out of it. Enemies are a lot more common and come in hordes for you to slaughter with ease unlike the traditional survival horror games that have spread out opponents who engulf the atmosphere since you have to conserve your ammo. So there basically isn't any tension outside of the damsel in distress needing saving, but that’s easily negated by placing her in a corner far away. I never actually had to heal Ashley whatsoever.\n\nNevertheless, it’s the last real RE that has an actual horror setting. By the time the series came to RE5, it lost that horror element in so many ways. It’s definitely a must buy, but I suggest also buying the original Resident Evil if you wish to compare and contrast the differences between the two, as RE4 definitely changed the formula for better or worse.\n\nCrapcom has a tendency to make sloppy ports so a couple of issues I need to address:\n\nThe game, for some unknown reason, takes up more space than Resident Evil 5. Not a big deal in this day and age since it's only 10gb, but it's still nevertheless strange.\n\nThe game can start dropping rapidly in FPS during various moments. I have no clue why, but it will start hiccupping if there is flames or other things going on.\n\nUse a console controller or something else than a keyboard. Capcom never bothered to concentrate on making a smooth transition to Keyboard and Mouse so it comes off a little wonky when aiming.\n\nChange your video settings to 30FPS when you get to the god damn mine cart. There’s no save point in the second Mine Shaft and the part where Leon is attempting to lift himself up is impossible to do on 60fps no matter how many times you smash the button during the quick time event. Capcom has never bothered to address this issue.\n\nThe Separate Ways campaign that is unlocked once the game is completed was originally made for the PS2. All the ingame cutscenes in the campaign look like complete shit because it's ripped directly from the PS2.",Recommended
"Great game, a bit hard...specially the first 10 minutes of game, but you get the hang of it in no time. The items/ammo management is great, you won't get too much ammo, forcing you to cycle your weapons more than you normaly would and adds the tension of maybe not having enough ammo...which adds to the suspense atmosphere.",Recommended

"Resident Evil 4 (originally released on Gamecube) is one of my favorite games of all time, so I was a little nervous to play the PC adaptation. Fortunately, the game is virtually everything that I remembered it being. For a game that's so old, it doesn't even look bad, which says a lot about the graphics and textures which have been updated for this remaster. I bought this game to relive the experience of playing it the first time, and it did not disappoint in that regard. When compared again modern games of this style objectively, I think that Resident Evil 4 may have a difficult time competing - but that's of little concern to me personally. For me this is now the definitive version of Resident Evil 4.",Recommended

"I tried the later Resident Evils first, hated them, and then came back to this one. \n\nRE4. It was the best of games. It was the worst of games. I loved it.\n\nWith a design decision that flies in the face of all modern game principles, RE's key gameplay element is that you can't move and shoot at the same time. This might be easier to deal with if your movement stick was not also your aiming stick, but it is, and it takes some getting used to. At first, you'll be instinctively trying to defend yourself and escape danger, throwing your aim into the sky or your boots as a result. However, it does add tension and it would be far too easy if not for that.\n\nI love this game like I love the movies featured on Red Letter Media's Best Of The Worst. Every single person in it is a dick, and not just the villains. Everybody. You. Your friends and colleagues. The weapons trader. The President's daughter. That snake in the box. With the honorable exception of the dog you save from the bear-trap (and you should save it, trust me on this), every last thing on the screen is a complete pillock. The script is gloriously rubbish and full of errors. The drama is hilarious. The attempts to add humour will make you wish you were dead. Everything conspires to make you cringe yourself inside out.

This is one of the good ones and the first to be done in this pioneering third person style, setting the benchmark for everything that's come from the series since.\n\nIt has a legitimate intensity from the very start and just as you start to get comfortable with the game it throws a new spanner in the works to keep you on your toes time and again. It's a thrill ride from start to finish and actually has a surprising amount of content for you to sink your teeth into with a good length main campaign which has unlockable higher difficulties, the ""Seperate Ways"" mini-campaign and the Mercernaries score attack mini-game.\n\nI recommend it heartily.",Recommended

"My 3rd playthrough finally happened in HD version. The game still looks cool, fun and enjoyable. Well, thats old Capcom in a nutshell. Monsters are really creepy even if u seen them many times. Gameplay is intense coz of ""stay and shoot"" mechanic and lack of ammos. Honestly, this game is about gameplay and impression in first place. Plot is not high tier even for horror games, and definitely loosing even to Silent Hill 4.\n\nAnd a big spoon of tar in honey barrel: awful HD PC release. Yes, it got high resolution textures, but PC release is not only about graphics. Game struggling of bad optimisation level coz of HD textures. It crushed 5 times coz i used not SD pack. Wierd, but i couldnt change sound volume inside the game. And it got half-made english subtitles: only in codec (damn son). My main language not english, so i was forced to use non-official translation. And seems like Capcom dont care about it. Well played!\n\nStill, its rly cool game and i definitely recomend it, coz it gives you such great experience. And its pretty good game for people who dont familiar to Capcom games, but want to start up. Peace!",Recommended
Piece of crap.,Not Recommended
I don't know if its just the version I played or not but I remember there was a lot more in this game. It seems like they cut out entire parts of the game. Stuff like the garden maze and getting the kings goblet things that I know were in the Wii verson I played. Also there are a lot of graphical bugs with certain setting that should work just fine.\nHowever the core gameplay is still good. things like distance and ammo management are still there. This is the last game of  the series I still consider to be a survival horror game before the went third person shooter horror. if your familiar with the series you will do fine if your new it will be a bit of a struggle at first but once you know whats coming the encounters are less frightening. 7/10 for lazy port quality though.,Recommended

"Sou fã da franquia desde os anos 90, quando eu ainda era bem novo, por isso meu rage quando Resident Evil 4 virou modinha foi grande... Enquanto os 3 primeiros jogos abusavam do terror e temática pesada, sendo survival horror puro até o talo, Resident Evil 4 chegou trazendo Leon de Resident Evil 2 mais eminho do que nunca para salvar Ashley, a filha do presidente dos Estados Unidos da América. Nada de mortos-vivos, nada de puzzles claustrofóbicos e tensos e o cúmulo da gurizada todynho e trakinas: Agora é possível comprar armas!\n\nPorra! Survival Horror não pode ter sistema de juntar moedinha pra comprar arminha não... A franquia sempre deixou isso bem claro, pois armas vc encontra pelo cenário, e as mais fodonas ficam em lugares fodões, cheio de sangue e monstros! Agora vc pode até tacar ovo de galinha nos inimigos, haha... Absurdo... Em termos de gráficos e jogabilidade o jogo deu um avanço, mas em trama, conteúdo de survival horror e dificuldade caiu MUITO! Por isso até um tempo atrás eu detestava esse game... Comprei na promoção da Steam pra zerar de novo quando eu estiver entediado, mas de um tempo pra cá eu venho pensando que a Capcom só queria inovar em algo e presentear os fãs, mas o problema é que esses fãs ridiculos e todynhos, trakinas leite com pêra enchem o saco idolatrando frescurinhas e ahh... caralho...\n\nPrós:\n\n-Gráficos legais\n-Easter Eggs e modo Mercenários bem legais\n-Além da campanha de Leon, temos a campanha da Ada também depois de zerar o game\n-Roupas desbloqueáveis\n-Muitas armas\n-Cenários bem grandes e detalhados que de vez em quando conseguem passar um clima de terror\n-Inimigo de Moto-Serra que lembra o maníaco do machado em RE: Outbreak File #2\n-Os modos Easy e Normal são interessantes... O normal possúi coisas que o Easy não tem, como um labirinto de cachorros no castelo e um cenário onde duas senhoras de moto-serra aparecem para perseguirem o jogador.\n\nContras:\n-Puzzles fáceis\n-Personagem coadjuvante chata\n-Clima de Survival Horror dos jogos anteriores quase totalmente descartado, tendo em exceção apenas alguns cenários assustadores e poucas situações\n-Personagem principal passou por uma situação tensa a 6 anos atrás em uma cidade tomada pelos zumbis onde era apenas um policial comum e iniciante que demonstrava medo, tensão, etc... e agora é considerado um super Badass pela gurizada por motivos de criancisse\n-Pouquíssimas opções de alterações gráficas nesse porte HD para PC\n\nNota 6/10\n\nRecomendo pra que curte um shooter bacana, mas pra quem quer conhecer a franquia, recomendo começar pelos primeiros!",Recommended

Plus the fact that she's helpless doesn't help either\n- Extremely inflated system requirements. Seriously, a game that's almost 11 years old should run on a potato. A few updates models and textures here and there shouldn't fuckin' require a mid-high spec PC.\n- Even though it's marketed as a fully 60FPS running game, a few animations are still locked to 30FPS. To name a few, the sniper reload animation, a few enemy movements and most fire/explosions effects. Not a huge problem, but slightly annoying and comes across as a bit lazy.\n- The quick time events, good god the quicktime events. They're everywhere and you can never sit back to watch a cutscene. If you don't have the capability of pressing the x button atleast 10 times per second, you're screwed.\n- It's locked to 60FPS. Just a reminder for people with 120/144hz monitors.

"When I stop and think about it, Resi4 is probably my most played game of all time. This is strange because I've been playing games since the SNES, but yeah I've beaten Resi4 on the Wii somewhere around 30 times, not counting the hours in Mercenaries and the occasional dabbling into Separate Ways.\n\nI'm saying this as a bone fide veteran of Resi4, do not buy the Steam edition.\n\nFor starters the keyboard and mouse controls for this game are godawful. Yes I know a gamepad is better, but when you're releasing what is effectively a 3rd person shooter on the PC, you're keyboard and mouse controls have got to fucking work.\n\nPlus the port feels very incomplete, for one there is bizarrely no mouse support for inventory menus. This means you have to guess how to move and sort your attache case, because nowhere does the game tell you how. I pressed keys at random and found out that left clicking, ""e"" or enter selects, backspace picks up, and I had to look up that PAGE DOWN rotates, really, page down, have you ever played a PC games that required you to press page down?\n\nAnd that's not even the worst part, the game is buggy as all hell, frame skipping is one thing, but even at the lowest settings the game can crash at any time for no reason, I had two crashes in just thirty minutes of gameplay and was done. Thank Gaben for Steam refund.\n\nBottom line, play any other version of Resi4 over this, especially the Wii version as that's still the best IMHO.

You can manually override these, but it screws the game up even further and makes some event triggers unresponsive (the one that drove me crazy was doors not opening and that truck in the one part not exploding). Resident Evil 4 is a great game, but this port is a poor treatment of a fantastic game. It amazed me to learn that this is supposed to be the UPDATED port and that the older port was even worse.

"Before saying anything else, Resident Evil 1,2, and 3 are some of my favorite games of all time.  I've played them countless times over the years.  I even bought the Game Cube years ago to play the RE1 remaster, which made a cool game nearly perfect.\n\nThen you have Resident Evil 4.....\n\nI first played it on the Game Cube, liking the story but hating the controls.  2 years later it came out on PC - I hated the controls even more because the port was absolute crap.  This HD version looks better but still handles like crap.  I can't stand the controls at all. Leon seems to be right in the way of seeing much of the enemies onscreen.  Naysayers will argue this adds to the tension, but when I have to take a few shots, walk away, turn around, and then aim again that sucks in every way possible.  And speaking of aiming, having to aim first before reloading is just plain stupid.\n\nMy greatest complaint about this game, however, is that it is the ""crossover"" game from the older style RE games where there was heavy puzzle solving into a straight up action game.  There are barely any puzzle solving elements in this game to be had.  This was also the start of the absolutely dreaful and game-breaking QTEs, and I will curse the inventor of that game play element for the rest of my life.  I also felt the story line started going way over the top in this game and realism was basically thrown out the window which kind of killed the experience.  Defending Ashely is a complete pain in the ass and she completely sucks as a companion, being a completely helpless little yuppie dork princess that she is.  \n\nOn the bright side....The atmosphere is very good, especially with the cult in the old castle, and it definitely has some intense moments.  The campaign is simply huge and you will get your money's worth there.  I also always liked Leon's character from RE2 where he was just a rookie, and you see him here tougher and more experienced.\n\nIt's  not my favorite RE by any means, and looking back I don't understand how it was viewed as being the greatest game of the year when it came out in 2005 but I can't say that I didn't enjoy it enough to replay it a few times.  I'll recommend it based on the scope of what it tries to achieve and the creepiness of the cult in the game, but be prepared for some horrid controls.",Not Recommended

"As anyone with anything resembling TASTE surely knows, Resident Evil 4 was not only a ""reboot"" of sorts for the RE franchise, but the last truly great HORROR game in the series before things went the way of all things Michael Bay.  Well, okay, so the Revelations series is getting increasingly promising, and RE5 certainly isn't a ""bad"" game by a long stretch...but on the whole, this is the last bona fide ""classic"" to bear the Resident Evil name.  It justifiably blew all us old fuckers away when it was first released many a yonk ago, but sentimentality aside, how does this stack up in the year 2015?  Hmmm, let's see now... \n \n   Well, the controls are still what many might consider a bit ""clunky"" (especially those who didn't ""grow up"" with the likes of the early RE games).  I personally feel that such limitations arguably increase the ""horror"" factor by rendering your character more vulnerable, but I guess that's all a matter of taste.  And while my computer is a mere laptop, it just happens to be a pretty expensive one that seems to run just about every game under the sun - including the notoriously demanding likes of The Evil Within - either at or close enough to top graphics.  Yet I couldn't get this game to run at anything faster than SLOW-FUCKING-MO without dialling the graphics all the way down to 1280 X 720, and the shadows down to Medium; and even then, there was still some lag once things got dark and stormy, what with all the lightning flashes and the rain pouring down.  \n\n   So, er...and I'll admit here that I'm far from a tech expert, but...I'm not entirely sure that I played the game at a truly ""superior"" level of graphics than I did on my Gamecube way back when.  My expectations that I'd easily be able to crank this baby up to 1920 were certainly ill-founded, let's put it that way!  So unless you have some super-mega-you-beaut computer set-up which can play literally EVERYTHING at maximum settings, I'm not entirely convinced that this is a necessary purchase for anyone who already owns the game on console.  EXCEPT, of course, for idiotic PC completists like myself, who are basically determined to render their past console purchases obsolete by putting all their eggs into one basket called Steam (still waitin' on them early RE and Silent Hill games on said distribution platform, though...hint, hint)!  \n \n   As for anyone who never played this game back in the day, well...it was a staggeringly groundbreaking and influential piece of work when it first come out in 2005, but in the decade since it has arguably dated a little, and if you didn't grow up with the ""tank"" controls of these old RE games you'll probably just find it infuriating from the word ""go"".  I could be wrong, but...I'm kind of suspecting the uber-A.D.D. generations which have come since won't have the time or patience to acclimatise themselves to the old-school mechanics, especially if they are primarily accustomed to first-person shooters in which one can run and jump backwards whilst rapidly firing two pistols at once.  These ye olde third-person survival horror games had an AESTHETIC, and a PHILOSOPHY, but it's not one that's liable to translate into the ultra-modern, instant gratification age.  \n \n   So who am I recommending this game to?  Well, probably no one, at full price.  And even on sale, only to the stubbornly sentimental or the open-mindedly curious.  Otherwise, I'd highly recommend the far more recent Resident Evil: Revelations games - ESPECIALLY the second one - to first-timers looking to try out an RE game, and if that gets you sufficiently hooked, well, you may well find your way back to this one in due time.  \n\n   Resident Evil 4 WAS a great game, and will thusly always BE a great game...the same way that a great film doesn't stop being a great film, just 'cause it was filmed in black-and-white, didn't have CGI, and didn't aspire to the same level of ""realism"" in the acting that we do nowadays.  But this is NOT a game which fits all that seamlessly into the contemporary gaming landscape, and no amount of questionable ""HD"" overhauling is going to change that.  Is it still ""clunky""?  Yes.  Is it still one of the greatest horror games ever made?  ABSO-FUCKING-LUTELY.  But for better or for worse, gaming has pretty much moved on, and I for one am certainly looking forward to where it's going.  A nice little trip down Memory Lane, to be sure, but hardly an essential purchase for, well, ANYONE really (except perhaps yours truly, and a few other sad folk well over the age of thirty)...\n \nVerdict: 9/10 (10 for the game, 8 for the port)! \n \n(PS  ""Go, Hitler!

"I am quite a fan of old Resident Evil series. Been playing first, second and third parts long time ago in my childhood and this part was a gamechanger for me. Let me explain myself... The game by itself is good, there are horror elements, interactive movies when you press a button at the right moments, puzzles, scarse ammo and you have to choose wisely what do you need and what you don't. BUT... This game marked for me the end of the Resident Evil series the way I used to know it. Not it's more of a shooter and less of a horror survival. Still a okay game series, it's enjoyable. Just not quite the same as it used to be.",Recommended

"My Love story With Resident evi Franchise \nOh my ! the first time i played this game was in 2006, when  we wanted to get a gamecube.\nThis gamecube was a special edition of Resident evil 4.\nWe didnt know what was it about.\nWe played it. or should i say my brother did.\ni was too scared to play,   we even gave it to a friend because  we had assured ourselves that we would never play again.\nwell it seems he was too scared to play it too, (tho he never said anything about it) so he gave it back to us after some days.\nI was scared. I even had nightmares , but slowly i started to adapt to it. not in a day, not in one month but  after  long time.\nI started playing it all the time(at easy of course, 'cause i was like 9-10 years old). \nResident evil 5 came out then!\nBy the time it got released we had already loved the 4th. \nthis one has co-op so it was more family friendly . it was the best for me and my bros!\nanyway , after a lot of time. i started getting interested in the lore of the whole series.  Watching videos on youtube, searching on google etc.. so i decided to play the games by myself. \nIt took me long enough  since i played, Resident 1,2,3,4,5,6,orc,code veronica X, gaiden,revelations, revelations 2, merc 3d, umbrella chronicles, and darkside chronicles etc.(yeah orc is an ""IF""  not main story). and after all this time i also have Resident evil 4 in Gamecube,ps3,ps4,steam <3 . and playing in Professional without any problems at all :).\nits my personal love story with this game. where it all begun..  Playing until now without getting bored of it!",Recommended

broken unless you change some game files needs to be fixed unplayable without game setting files changed to cap fps at 25. its an easy fix but its frusurating when something is Not Recommendedly advertised. when you can run bioshock maxed at +60 fps but you cant run resident evil 4 a game that could run on gamecube and really good you know there is something wrong. i wouldnt recomend it unless you are a huge fan of the game and cant wait for the inevitable port to xbox one and ps4.,Not Recommended

Though it may not be for some due to it's more older control scheme (though this is what makes it so great compared to recent lackluster releases in the resident evil franchise) it is still highly recommended that you try this game at least once (or over a dozen) to see what a lot of people consider the prime of the survival horror series of Resident Evil. 10/10",Recommended

"Haven't played since the Nintendo Gamecube...\nI remember putting countless hours into the game.\nIt was one of my all time favorites on the Nintendo Gamecube...\nFast forward to 2015...I purchased the PC version of it...why?\nI love RE4...but I don't have a Gamecube now...it broke...so sad.\nI got lazy to purchase another...I don't even know if they sell those anymore.\nAnyway, planning on purchasing the whole RE collection on Steam.",Recommended
"One of the best games of its generation, and still holds up surprisingly well...It set new standards for action games.\n\n\nBut I´m a hardcore resident evil fan, and this game is utter garbage as a numbered RESIDENT EVIL game. Lets analyze why.\n\nRemember, I will be judging it as a numbered entry in the Resident Evil series, i already state this game is excellent, if we forget is a Resident Evil.\n\n-You can shoot a snake with a pistol, and get magnum ammo, dumb as hell...Basically enemies are item pinhatas, completely dumbing down the whole ""save ammo"" notion.\n\n-You play as what the tell you to be Leon S Kennedy, who went from a relateabe rookie in RE2, to a bland traitless character who's only trait is to look ""badass cool"" and spout one liners that would make Sonic the Hedgehog cringe in disgust. He doesnt smoke or have sex, but sure has no problem with genocide.\n\n-You will face overdesigned monster without recieving any sort of emotional response, while in classic resident evil games could make you scared shitless of simple crows...When a bird that you can just whack and kill becomes scarier than massive abominations, you know the game is failing as hard as it could possibly fail.\n\n-This game introduced the dreadful QTEs to the franchise, a lazy design choice that's more and more common in these games, and while using it well, could be nice, it ended up being overused.\n\n-In this game you spend your time killing humans...Human VIllagers, Human Monks, Human Soldiers..oh and there are some dogs in some sections...\n\n-Its incredibly linear and inconsistent in tone...You might be in a village killing townspeople, then in castle killing monks, then in a military base killing soldiers, and all this is achieved by walking forward all the time.\n\n-Stories in RE games have never been the best, but this one is literally non existent, save the presidents daughter, i mean, is the dumbet premise i think i can remember to any game.\n\n-The game is so padded, you will be begging to end, but not, its lenghty, but not because the story required it or anything, the game decides to throw in new plot points out of nowhere to extend the duration, in other words, is overstretched to the point, you don't care of what you are doing ot why.\n\n-There is no horror to be found here, I´m super easy to scare, bought RE nemesis when it came out on psx, cause loved the 2 previous ones, and played the shit outta them even if they scared me shitless, but I never finished Nemesis, cause was too scary for me..And other recent horror titles still scare me, so is not like i´ve grown up, so i can't be scared of games anymore...Is just, RE4 os not scary, cause it encourages you to be offensive, to kill everything on screen.\n\n-Which leads me to the pointless chapter and rating system, that has no place in any resident evil game unless is for once you've finished the game...Chapters, really? why not damn stages like mario, you hack. Loses the charm of the interconnectivity of the old games, and also, it totally interrupts the flow of the game, to be reminded that you are only progressing forward there is not margin.\n\n-Also, the voice acting, while it has always been cheese, this time is downright offensive...Hearing japanese voice actors speaking in mexican accent pretending to be spanish villagers, you know they don't give a shit about research or who the heck they'd potentially offend. But then again, RE5 happened after, and make this game look tolerant and subtle.\n\n-Is not a fucking spinoff...See, most shitty RE games, or less known, like Dead Aim, or Code Veronica, were spinoff titles, and some of them took new approaches on an old formula, some did well, some didnt, so...why in the unholy name of the devil's mother does this game have a 4 in its title? it clearly isnt a survival horror, or a classic RE game, it doesnt have anything to do with RE other than the characters, perfect set up for a spinoff!!! Sadly, it isnt...\n\nIf you made it this far, chances are you gotta be either mad, or wanna know more...And trust me, there is much more to rip appart in this game, as an RE entry.\n\nSo on one hand i hate it, on the other, is a great game that you will play over and over, and pick a bunch of years later and find out it still holds up. Is a shooter, but a tense one, since you lack mobility, raising slightly the stakes if you compare it to the average shooter.\n\nI´m tempted to not recommending it, and really, if you are a classic resident evil fan, you have already played this...So for people that have no idea about this game...Give it a shot if its on sale, its pretty long, pretty fun, and...I don't know why, but everyone leaves their critic in the closet when playing this game, so i guess that makes it enjoyable.",Recommended
"* This is for those who know what it is, but aren't sure what to expect from this new PC version*\n\nJust finished whole game, works fine. Rarely crashes on startup, once crashed on loading next level (saving each time adviced), graphics look about the same as PS3 version and you can only exit game by using Alt+F4 (there is an exit button in the new menu screen after completing game).

"It's....Resident...Evil! You know, that franchise that everyone believes Capcom killed, but in reality they didn't.\n\nAnyways, This is Resident Evil 4, and personally, this is my favorite game of all time.\n\nThere's a lot of reasons as to why this game is my favorite game of all time.\n\nI have completed this game well over 10 times, which is more than any game I've ever played before,(PS2/GC/XB360 is where most of my time is)\n\nAnyways, onto the review!\n\nYou are playing as Leon S Kennedy, former officer of the Raccoon City Police Department, you are assigned to travel to Europe to investigate the president's daughters kidnapping. Along the way you will uncover many mysteries as to why these events are taking place.\n\nThe combat is one of the first titles to popularize the over the shoulder type gameplay, which works flawlessly. There are many weapons in this game, including pistols, shotguns, RPGs, you're basic array of Action style weapons.\n\nYou can also shoot the enemy in the knee and perform a twist kick, or a suplex on certain enemies which makes the combat fresh and fluid.\n\nGameplay- Kind of already talked about, but this game blends excellent pacing with some fun puzzles(arghhh knight room). Ashley is not a hinderance to you, she is actually a good companion, as she doesnt usually get herself in trouble which is rare for AI these days.\n\nMusic- Eh...It's a good soundtrack, never really paid too much attention, although some of the music really fits the setting.\n\nControls- Couple different layouts here, nothing special.\n\nReplayability- You can easily play Resident Evil 4 5+ Times, Once you beat the game on Normal you unlock Professional, which is much much harder, the game itself on normal is pretty easy, but once you play it on Veteran, You can only take a few hits and you will be dead.\n\nOverall, this is an amazing game that if you somehow have not managed to play(it's got countless releases) you really need to experience this game. This is one of the finest crafted games there have ever been, not many other games can match its speed and pacing, or it's replayability. \n\nThanks for reading and I hope you pick up this fun game because of this review =)\n\n[][]",Recommended

"This game is weird, maybe I'm infected with ALL the praise this game have received, everywhere they review 2000 and NGC and PS2 games RE4 was mentioned. I haven't been able to stop playing, I've been spending weekends playing at 1:00 am , and even daydream about playing this game which I haven't felt since last Call Of Duty Black Ops, for which I stayed till 3AM playing.\n\nThe biggest downside about this game it's the controlls are really DULL and weird to play,  that they left the old controls scheme, you can't walk and enjoy the scenery like many FPS and over the shoulder games have made standard. You can only walk bacwards and forwards and turn with the same joystick, awfull to play and I was about to quit playing at the first hour. I try to understand this since I played all resident evil before up to RE3 which was the last release on PC. I try to understand they tried to keep this old RE gameplay, and I try really hard, but this is a remake, controll should have been imporoved.\n\nAnyhow graphics are really neat, you can even read all the details on a grenade.\nAlso I liked the fact they use a fanservice version, I read back when RE4 was released they added an animation when you try to look under asahley's skirt when she is on the roof or top of ladder, and japanese version didn't added that animation of ashley' screaming and covering her skirt",Recommended

I prefer the whole not being able to move mechanic on fixed perspective games like the earkier RE games or Silent Hill.

Game also responds pretty well to 360 joy. Also, for better control go to options and set aiming in Modern. \n\nIf you didn't play this game but loved Dead Space and Evil Within, it may be very hard for this game to scare you, but combat is great.

Running on Windows 8 with no problems optimization-wise.\n+While the graphics are slowly starting to show their age, the level aesthetics are timelessly creepy.\n+Enemies are significantly scarier with far less effort, making RE5's seem goofy and tryhardish (even moreso than usual).\n+Combining treasure is fun and rewarding.\n+The merchant is one of the most interesting and likable characters in the Resident Evil lore, and we know nothing about him. Let's keep it that way, Capcom.\n\n\nCons\n-No strafing. \n-So much as touching the right stick causes the camera to swing to either side of Leon.\n-No aiming sensitivity setting. I hope you like aiming at a snail's pace.\n-The only stun point worth shooting is the head. There's no melee prompt for any other stun point.\n-Combining ammo with a firearm in-menu does nothing.\n-Leon aims his gun like Micheal J. Fox. USA's secret service training sucks a big one.\n-The merchant is a stingy chainsmoking jerk. I know you have ammo, you know I'm good for it!

"Overall, the game is very faithful to the original.  In some ways, I would say a bit too faithful.\n\nWhile the graphics are decent and smooth.  Your controls are locked unless you are willing to change the settings file directly and there is no way to setup a mouse look.\n\nSo you are stuck with the same ""Tank"" style control method you used on the playstation 2 regardless of if you are using a Keyboard and Mouse or a Controller with no way to change it to a more modern style which basically just makes the game more difficult for difficulties sake which is more frustrating than anything unless you want to relearn an old control style that most games ditched years ago.\n\nSo, if you use the mouse to pan to your right and go to shoot, when you pull out your gun, you aren't aiming where you are looking on your screen, you are aiming straight infront of your character at whatever is off-screen in that direction.\n\nOther than the dated and frustrating control style, it actually seems very well done from what little I have played so far.\n\nAlso 1080p resolution & 60 FPS which really nice",Recommended

No rose tinted glasses, this game is a fantastic adventure. \nEnemies offer a suitable challenge and the boss fights do not dissapoint. Depending on the level you play, amunition can be rather scarce allowing for the player to make choices of what and when to shoot as opposed to trying to shoot out legs and using kicks/ knife.\nThe only gripe I have about the game is looking after the girl. I've never been a fan of escort missions but I'm sure people out there do enjoy that type of gameplay. It's more of a minor annoyance to me.\nI will admit that even though I do most of my gaming on the PC I did find the KB and mouse combination a little tough to get used to but once I plugged in my controller things became so much more fun.\nI would definately recommend this game to those who haven't ever played it.

"Best compliment I can give a video game, owning a copy on multiple consoles. I first bought Resident Evil 4 back in 2005 for the Nintendo Gamecube. Back then it was amazing, and it still is. Add on the remastering and additional content, and this is the definitive version. Needless to say, this is the best Resident Evil out of the more modern games. Though I'm a diehard survivor horror fan, I still enjoy this game simply because it is good. I know some people out there believe that this game is bad because it's more action based rather than horror, but I don't really care. Whether or not you like this game, you still have to acknowledge that this game was innovative. Innovative in the sense that it was one of the first games to popularize the over the shoulder camera angle. At this point I'm just rambling so I'll end this review by saying that this game is a must own, no matter whether you're a Resident Evil fan.",Recommended
"I picked this game up after finishing The Evil Within because so many people compared the two games.  I was pleasantly surprised and really enjoyed this game. The dialogue though somewhat cheezie fits perfectly into the story. This game is a classic and now one of my favorite games of all time. It is not nearly as scary as The Evil Within IMO but it does have a few moments. The story, characters and action are what really drive this game. \n\nI highly recommend this game. It is a gem.",Recommended

The gameplay is amazing with heart pounding sequences all around. The characters all are really memorable and the bosses OH THE BOSSES are either really fun and a good chalenge (eg Salazar and Saddler) but some are just frustratingly annoying (eg the double el gigante fight and vertigo). the games music is well... AMAZISAURUS REX. After you beat the great story mode you unlock fantastic other gamemodes that even show other sides of the story making for a completionists delight. this game is not only amazing with the epic and action packed sections but also sometimes scary as all hell making you jump out of your chair and scream louder than an airhorn.

"Its hard to give a factual reason as to why this game is so great, RE4 somehow perfectly blends the best elements of all previous games with a new focus on fast paced action and by doing so it suprisingly doesn't screw the series up. The main character and villans are great, with Leon being a fan favourite character. The level of creativity and childlike ideas that this game houses is pretty crazy. Most games nowadays wouldn't try to implement third person shooting, horror and a wacky story into a single game but capcom pulled it off.\n\nIn terms of gameplay most of the game is progression from one area to the next whilst killing enemies, solving puzzles and collecting items in the best way imagineable. But personally what I like most about RE4 is the boss enemies; Giants, Giant snakes and a bunch of John Carpenter wet dreams are all so memorable and fun to fight. The combat system is great and adds to the fun of fighting these creatures.\n\nI think you should stop reading this and just play the game",Recommended
"Oh my gosh. I'm just going to gush about Resident Evil 4 for a bit. This game is my favourite of ALL TOYME.\n\nFirst time I played this game was on the Wii many years ago. I had never played a Resident Evil game and didnt play many third person shooters, let alone horror games. I had only seen a few Youtube videos about the game and that was enough for me to want to try and play it. And oh my Gosh this game is perfect. Its atmospheric, the designs of everything is so eerie and creepy, the action is great, the learning curve is perfect, the puzzles aren't too difficult, the bosses OH THE BOSSES ARE SO COOL. THERES A GUY WHO GROWS REALLY TALL AND GOES RAWR AND THE ROOM IS ON FIRE AND ITS SO CRAMP AND ITS SCARY! \n\nNow as for controls its a bit of a different story. The keyboard and mouse are just fine, though playing with a controller is a bit wonky since its a very early TPS game of its kind. But its very easy to get a hang of. The inventory system is perfect how you can organize it and rearrange your items so you can hold what you want! \n\nThe story is very simple, and you could probably say thats a drawback but I dont think of it as such. Its easy to follow and the voice acting, while cheesy, is cheesy enough that its enjoyable to listen to (except for Ashley). \n\nJust... just buy this game is perfect.\n\n10/10.. 100/100.

"Resident Evil 4, the game where the series was transformed from a top down puzzle solving mansion crawling experience to a strategic stand and fight third person shooter.  You play the stories main protagonist, Leon S. Kennedy, the stereotypical definition of a super human cop, which is ironic because he was JUST a normal police officer til the zombie nation attacked.   He was sent to Europe to find out who kidnapped the presidents daughter, ""Leon Help.""  With his dreamy blonde hair, and his quick quips, it's no surprise that Ashley falls for our hero, and he proceeds to kill everyone in Europe who looks at him funny.\n\nPros:\nAlthough most people will disagree, I liked the unique control system that got me killed til I learn how to use it properly.  Once mastered I found it very rewarding\nThe inventory ""tetris"" mini game concept is also very additive, honestly if they had just made the inventory system the game I would probably have still played the s**t out of it\nThe game rewards you for headshots by making ammo seem so sacred you will pray to saint Mary for every bullet you fire\nThe weapons are very satisfying to use, but then again maybe i have a crush on leon, don't judge\n\nCons:\nThe controls can be a bit confusing to a new player, but lets be honest, if you got this game on pc you probably already enjoy the game, who am i kidding\nAshley is a f**king b**ch\nThe dialoge is so bad, it's good\nF**KING ASHELY STOP GETTING KILLED F**K\nDid I mention escort missions are toxic as h*ll?\nTo be honest though, the Ashley mechanic isn't forced on you the entire game, and honestly it adds an interesting aspect for different parts of the game\nWhat are you selling?\nWhat are you buying?\nMerchant flashes me every time I buy something\nI'm just kidding, this game is perfect\n\nConclusion:\nIf you can survive the learning curve of the controls and game play mechanics, you are in for a real treat of a survival horror game.  I remember the first time I played this game I was terrified. Mostly because I had bought the game without my parents permission and I was afraid of being caught.  Oh and the game has some of the best pacing and reward system I've ever played, hands down.  Oh, try looking up Ashley's skirt sometime, you pervert. #ballistics",Recommended
"After playing countless hours of Resident Evil 4: Wii Edition when I was younger and having completed the game numerous times, I had to invest in the PC edition. And I wasn't dissappointed. You probably won't be either.\n\nLet's start with performance. This game is a delight to play, it's well optimized, with a choice of either a 30fps or 60fps lock in the options menu, as well as a few graphical settings to mess around with. The options menu is simple, allowing you to configure in-game sound, brightness and other display settings with ease. I had no problems whatsoever with performance whilst playing through the main story.\n\nAs for the game itself, if you haven't played a Resident Evil game, or even a similar horror game before, I'd highly recommend Resident Evil 4 as a starter to familiarise yourself with the genre of the series. RE4 is widely regarded as one of, if not the best of all the current games in the franchise, so I wouldn't be surprised if you were dissappointed with some of the other titles after playing RE4, especially the later ones. RE4 plays differently to many of the other titles in the franchise, and it appears more adventure based and expansive, which in my opinion adds a great dimension and makes it fantastically unique.\n\nResident Evil 4's main storyline is engaging and exciting throughout, you'll meet a variety of charismatic characters whilst playing in a multitude of different locations. You play Leon, a special agent, and survivor of the Raccoon City outbreak, who, to put simply, is a badass. Your mission is to rescue the president's daughter, Ashley, who has been caught up in the nightmare and kidnapped by a cult ring, whom control the minds of their victims and turn them into near-zombie psychopaths who want to murder you. You'll be accompanied by Ashley on and off within the story, your main goal being her protector, as she doesn't fight alongside you. Although this can become a little bit of a strain now and then, and Ashley can be regarded as merely 'baggage' by some, it's always nice to have another human nearby as you're shooting hordes of brainless enemies and constantly facing the prospect of death.\n\nThere are three main 'areas' of the game, the first being the 'village', where you start out the main storyline. Here you'll encounter angry villagers, giant trolls and chainsaw-wielding maniacs. Then you'll move onto the 'castle', where you're greeted by strange zombified monks, and finally the 'island', where you'll be up against angry possessed soldiers, and odd creatures. Not to mention the various bosses that you'll find throughout the story, most of which are pretty terrifying. You'll also meet the 'trader' on your travels, who will appear randomly around the map to sell and buy your weapons and other gear. He's always a welcome sight, making you feel safe from the terror for all of five minutes as you frantically sell your precious collected gems for a new pistol or a few extra inventory slots.\n\nWith all of these different locations, NPCs and the varying map in general, Resident Evil 4 feels diverse, with a new terror around every corner. It doesn't feel repetitive, as some horror games do. Talking about repeating, the main story has a ton of replay value, with collectables and weapons galore. You can replay the story with infinite rocket launchers and tommy-gun style machine guns, wearing ridiculous costumes in the process, if you so wish.\n\nIn addition to the main storyline, there are also three other game modes which are unlocked after completing the campaign. There is 'The Mercenaries', which is an arcade style minigame where the player can play as and unlock different characters within a time limit to aim for a high score. There are also two other campaigns, 'Separate Ways' and 'Assignment Ada', where you'll play as Ada, one of the characters that you encounter during the main story. You'll find that the three campaigns all cross over, as you'll bump into Leon as Ada, and vice versa, which is a nice touch.\n\nEach of the different storylines play extremely well and are endlessly entertaining, which'll keep you occupied for hours on end killing brainwashed villagers and trying to unlock all of the special items within the game. There are three different difficulty settings for the main story: Easy, Normal, and Professional. The difficulty levels are well balanced, and even on Professional difficulty, the game is bareable and not too frustrating, with the exception of a few specific parts. You just have to play it reasonably safe. It took me roughly 11 hours alone to beat the main story on Normal, and I've still barely touched the Mercenaries mode, as well as Separate Ways and Assignment Ada on the PC version. If you're looking for a lengthy and enjoyable story, along with loads of extra content to keep you occupied, Resident Evil 4 is the game for you.\n\nTo conclude, Resident Evil 4 PC is an absolute joy to play, a timeless classic, and a must for all Resident Evil and horror fans in general. 10/10.",Recommended

"This is possibly my favorite game ever made and I started playing games about 27 years ago.\n\nI played through the original version of the Gamecube probably about 10 times. I then bought it for the Wii and played through that version about 3 times. I've been out of the country for awhile now and haven't had access to the GC or Wii version. Luckily, it came on Steam. \n\nAs of typing this, I have somewhere around 37 hours clocked in. I've played through the Steam version twice, once on Normal and once on Professional. I would have more hours, but I don't have access to my desktop computer and my laptop has trouble running this game. My desktop runs the game almost flawlessly, but it's about 6 years old now, so there are some issues here and there.\n\nAll that aside, I really do think this might be the best game ever made. The biggest reason this game is so great is because of the flow of the game and the level design. As you progress through the game, each area is so different than the last. This game never gets old.\n\nThere is a wide variety of weapons and upgrades which become available as you progress through the game and if you ever want a break, you have Mercenaries mode, which could almost be its own game. There are also some other extras like Assignment Ada, Separate Ways, and the gun range.\n\nFlaws some people might say this game has:\n\nNot being able to move while shooting\nThe island not being as well made as the village and the castle\n""Leon, help!!!!!!!""\nNo Luis in Merceneries mode\n\nI love this game and I can't recommend it enough.\n\nUpdate -- Going to the config.ini file and changing anisotropy to 2 (thanks whoever's review I read) and then loading the game and changing the FPS to 30 makes the game run mostly smooth on my laptop. The config.ini file can be found in Documents > My Games > Capcom > RE4.",Recommended

"One of the best and most loved Resident Evil games of all times. I was really excited about this port and the game is as fantastic as it was back then. But we all played RE4 so I don't want to talk about the game itself, but about the technicial aspect of it.\n\nAs promised you're getting a RE4 HD experience like never before. 60fps really gives the game a new feel but unfortunately there are some issues with that as well. The game's engine wasn't designed to run at 60fps so there are some bugs. But overall doens't hurt the experience.\n\nThe so called ""HD textures"" are a complete joke and aren't much of an upgrade from the original. Luckily there's a fan made high res texture pack on its way that looks beyond promising and it might be worth buying just for that. \n\nOn top of that this game is poorly optimized, so if you have a low end computer, be warned, it's much more demanding than the original PC port and you might not be able to run this. \n\nAll this aside, it's still a great game and I do recommend it.",Recommended

I can't even play half the fooken game due to the fact that it crashes in the fountain area (I did it in Leons campaign fine, but when it came to Adas campaign it will continuously crash, meaning I'm losing a good 4-5 hours of gameplay off of the game, and outfits and items etc. This port is fucking horrendous, and steam refuses to give me a refund as I'm passed the two hour mark. The game doesn't even fucking run properly, and they're refusing to give me a refund. This ain't like a survival game thats in EA that you hate because its lagging, no no. This is a game thats been out for YEARS that has a shit port, where you're forced to disable antiviruses, change files, etc, just to play it slightly. Then you'll still have constant fucking crashes. I was SOOOO hyped for this, was super pleased when i beat the game (even with the bugs) but afterwards with Ada's campaign etc? That's just totally unacceptable. Capcom fucked this up so bad its not even funny. Go to your local pawn shop, but a gamecube, or a wii, buy RE4, and live without having to deal with file changes for hours and hours, and having to look up ways to fix your game, because i am STILL currently trying to figure out how the fuck to fix this garbage. 7/10 Three points off because of the fucking horrendous port.",Recommended

While the graphics are clearly dated, this HD version is pretty passable considering the game is over 10 years old. If you're like me you've played this game and traded it back in more times than you care to admit... add it to your steam library and you'll be able to come back to it whenever you please.",Recommended
Fantastic all time favorite. Best Resident Evil Ever. I have played through 8 times and have done all bonus material on the Wii. Unfortuantely I have bought this game via Steam and am unable to play. Have tried uninstall/reinstall multiple times to no avail and have struggeled enough to write this post. Game does not begin to load and acts as if it was never clicked on. Would love help because I miss this game and want to play on PC now. Best Resident Evil Ever.,Recommended
"Resident Evil 4 was released in 2005 for GameCube and was later released on other platforms. It looks like Capcom wanted to significantly improve its visuals for the second PC port as the first PC port was released in 2007. The graphics are sharper than ever and the gameplay is very good, although a few small problems exist.\n\nThis game has been enhanced for 1080p resolution at 60FPS. There is keyboard and mouse support with the ability to customize the keys. Resident Evil 4 HD comes with the Separate Ways campaign to increase replay value. The keyboard and mouse work very well together, but sometimes the laser targeting is not perfect and that can lead to problems when there are multiple enemies near you or when a large boss monster is approaching.\n\nThe plot of the game begins with the kidnapping of Ashley Graham, the daughter of the president of the United States. Leon Kennedy, the well-known protagonist of the series, has been sent to a village in Spain to rescue Ashley. What happens in the Spanish village is that there is a religious cult that has released an ancient parasite called Las Plagas on to the countryside. The religious cult does not consist of zombies like other Resident Evil games. You begin fighting ganados, a group of foes who carry pitchforks and are both males and females. Later, you will meet darker and tougher foes known as cultists, religious zealots who wear red or black robes.\n\nAs Leon progresses through the story, there will be memos explaining the plan of the cult known as the Illuminados. These memos keep you well informed of the plot and it seems to get darker and darker. The environments are appropriately creepy as Leon looks for Ashely. Resident Evil 4 retains the series’ history of creepy and dark locales. There are misty forests, decrepit houses, moldy caverns, a large castle, and military facilities. The locales display diversity so that there is no monotony. Leon is joined by other characters like Luis Sera and the Ada Wong. Luis Sera is a local citizen who is willing to help Leon. Leon engages in a long shooting with the ganados while Mr. Sera helps out in this long battle. Ada Wong is a familiar figure to Resident Evil fans and has had a long relationship with Leon. There are bits and pieces of the script that indicate past romances and rivalries. However, the plot keeps you at the edge of your seat at all times, which is the way it should be for a Resident Evil game.\n\nThe graphical enhancements of the diverse locales are what make this game feel like it is not so old. The details of Leon, his allies, and enemies are impressively sharp and well defined. The walls of the castle look extremely realistic. You can see the dust falling from the ceiling of caverns that make the caverns both realistic and creepy. The textures look amazing in high resolution, but in some cases they look a little bit archaic and out of place. However, the details of the textures are sharp enough to outweigh any archaic look you may find. Military facilities make you feel like that there is a nasty experiment going on while it also feels abandoned.\n\nThe bosses are diverse and require you to figure out their main weaknesses in order to defeat them. One issue that pops up in boss battles and in other parts of the game is the quick time events. Sometimes you have to press two buttons at once very quickly to avoid key attacks or avoid deadly traps. It can feel awkward trying to press the X + C keys or the two mouse buttons while using the WASD keys in tense circumstances. While it is appropriate to have tense circumstances in a Resident Evil game, it can get frustrating trying to press two keys at once but dying in the process because of you are not able to press the buttons in time. Another issue that comes up is the laser targeting of the firearms. There are times when the laser targeting takes time to be accurate while one or more enemies are quickly approaching you. Also, the laser can twitch in the spur of the moment, leading to more difficult encounters with the various types of enemies and possible waste of ammo. Ammo is always at a premium in the game, so twitching is a bad thing in a game like this.\n\nAll firearms can be upgraded by visiting the various merchants that stand around waiting for you. Upgrading your weapons will make your shots noticeably more powerful. You can upgrade your weapons to the max so that you can be an “exclusive” weapon that will be far more powerful than the weapon you fully upgraded. The challenge is to find the pesetas scattered throughout the locales and dropped by the enemies. You will have to quite a bit of searching for pesetas and treasures with lots of value if you want to upgrade any of your firearms to the max.\n\nThere is some randomness when it comes to shooting enemies, especially in the head. Some ganados and cultists will simply fall to their deaths with a headshot. Other enemies will show their Plagas, spider-like figures that emerge from their necks, and continue to try to attack you. You can either fire a shotgun at their Plagas or use a flash grenade to finally finish them off. There are encounters that require crowd control, so you can use different types of grenades to bring some relief to these tense encounters.\n\nOther enemies that are interesting and horrific include garradores, colmillos, and regenerators. The garradores do not attack unless they hear your sound and are blind. Their only weakness is the Plagas shown on their backs. Colmillos are terrifying dogs that can jump on top of you by surprise. Regenerators are special monstrosities in that you can only use a sniper rifle with an infrared scope to locate and shoot their Plagas on their torso.\n\nResident Evil 4 is worth playing for its diverse locations, creepy atmosphere, and tense encounters. The nail biting gameplay lives up to what Resident Evil fans expect from a Resident Evil game. The high resolution graphics make the PC version the definitive version to play.\n\nMy Score: 8.5/10",Recommended
"I pre-ordered the limited edition of this game on Gamecube and I really enjoyed playing it in 2005.\nBought again 10 years later, now my mind is clear : this is not as good as the first three Resident Evils but not as bad as the game that followed.\nStill retains a few of the survival horror dynamics we loved while 5 and 6 completely ruined it.\nI didn't like the last part of the game because it was clearly a step in the wrong direction (helicopters, enemy shooting at you and such).\nIt's a good game, I'd say a great game (as it was awarded) but if it wasn't called Resident Evil it would have been the same since it feels like a completely new game.",Recommended
Quite litterally one of the best games ever.,Recommended
I spent one day playing this for 15 hours.\nIt has to be one of the most addictive games I've played recently.\nWhy did I like it?\nI thought the weapon stats and unlockables were really cool I especially like the mini games like the shooting range and adas side story stuff.\nAlso inventory management man.\n\nThis was my first in the series so when I started I moved quite slow and couldn't really aim but now after 17 hours I'm sorta alright.\nFunny how a new round only takes about 4 hours.\nFun game I like. \n\n,Recommended

I somehow end up buying this on every platform it comes out on and play through it every single time.,Recommended
Best RE4 ever.,Recommended
"Extremley dissapointed with this supposed to be an improved HD remake.  It is no more than a poorly implement emulation of a console version of the game.\n\nThere is significant delay and slowdowns in the game at any graphic setting, even when turning off everything and using lowest possible settings - keeping in my mind that my system easily exceeds the recommended system requirements.\n\nMoreover, the keyboard and mouse controls are terrible to say the least.  The mouse is used only for looking, not to control the direction of movement, and its sensitivity is not balanced in the vertical and horizontal directions.  Coupled with the slowdowns, these mouse and keyboard problems make playing this game a painful experience.\n\nMy recommendation would be to avoid this supposed to be remake/emulation, get the original PC version and download the mouse mod.  Even with only using the keyboard, the old PC version is much superior in terms of control and playability.",Not Recommended

Loved playing through the game! I remember when I played this on the Gamecube and LOVED it! And now being able to play it again was amazing.

It's not such a fantastic port, and everyone knows that. However, the game can still run a constant 30 fps, but there are some spots where fps dips are huge. Which is unnecessry for a masterpiece like this. Also, there is an option to fix the mouse in the options, you just need to look.\n\nThe actual game itself is incredible. Fantastic story, fantastic characters, fantastic maps. The game is just great. There are places where you can sit back and relax, and there are places where you are at the edge of your seat, praying that a Blind Slaughter-Machine won't notice you.\n\nOverall it's a great game. \nJudging by port quality: 5/10 (So much room for improvement.)\nActual game quality: 10/10",Recommended
"this game was not working for me at first but then I figured what my problem was. I had to update my video cards drivers. if any one is woundering I have a amd graphics card. after I updated the drivers, the game ran smooth.

"RE4 is a masterclass in how to make video games fun. Although, I can't help but feel that something is missing from this game. In Duke Nukem Forever, you play through a campaign that's constant action through and through and yet they mix in great gameplay as well as wonderful character progression in a thoughtfully crafted story that could be mistaken for an H.P. Lovecraft story. RE4, though it gets close, cannot match Duke Nukem Forevers' high octane gameplay. As Duke Nukem Forever is fun the whole way through it's campaign, RE4 only acheives that through the first 2/3 of the game. The island is boring and bland as compared to Duke Nukem Forevers' beyond complex and fleshed out world and this causes boredom to take over while trying to finish RE4. Also, seeing as RE4 went for a more action oriented route, I feel as if RE4s' gunplay wasn't the best choice. In Duke Nukem Forever, the first person perspective allows for perfect aim as well as quick and free flowing gameplay that allows for skill to come up on top. RE4 has a third person perspective and locks your movement when you aim. When aiming, Leon can't stop shaking as if he was frightened and this DOES mess with your aim making for certain long range shots to be more difficult than neccesary. ALso, in RE4, it feels as if you're aiming and shooting its's almost impossible to avoid certain enemy attacks. They try to remedy this with being able to shoot projectiles out of the air and stun animations for enemys allowing for AOE attacks. But this doesn't even come close to matching Duke Nukem Forevers' fast movement allowing for projectiles to be dodged and with enough skill, being able to avoid every attack even on the hardest of difficulties. The bosses in RE4 are subpar to Duke Nukem Forevers' bosses as well. El Gigante feels like a carbon copy of the Cycloid Emperor boss in DUke Nukem just done very poorly. Even bosses such as Salazar mare repetitive and boring with only 2 or 3 phases while Duke Nukem Forever bosses have 7-8 phases that all change the boss entirely, much like Dark Souls but good. The upgrade system in RE4 takes away from the skill ceiling heavily, especially due to upgrades for weapons like the pistol that increase crit chance which is just buying better RNG. Duke Nukem Forever hands you an assortment of weapons and says ""have fun"". A lack of an upgrade system allows for much more skill based combat as compared to the RNG heavy combat of RE4. For these reasons, although I still reccomend RE4 to everyone, if one has not played Duke Nukem Forever I Strongly reccomend putting off RE4 until you complete Duke Nukem Forever in its entirety.",Recommended

Slow motion in cutscenes, random frame rate slow downs, and audio sync issues make it hard to like. The Keyboard + Mouse isn't horrid but no where as good as a controller. Really dissapointing that its crazy buggy and no one has released anything to fix it (recent patch has not fixed it for Laptop users).",Not Recommended

"What is it about Resident Evil 4 that makes it the best action game of the last 20 years?   It's certainly not the cringe-worthy dialogue and dubious translation.   \n\nSo Could it be that the plot, such as it is, flawlessly escalates in scale and scope from running around a villiage to battling hordes of corrupted Spanish Troops on an oil rig?   Could it be that it manages this transition in a smooth and organic enough way that you move from one to the other without losing a sense of place and escalating tension and scale?  This is something that RE5 never managed - and it's critical to keeping the audience.\n\nNo, what makes RE4 the best is it's longevity.  It's a rare action game that is still hitting you with surprises and terrifying twists 10 hours in.   There is never a point in this game where the danger diminishes, in fact despite your growing power the challenge never abates.   This is assisted by some of the best level design *ever*.  The sheer joy and creativity that oozes out of every pore in this games levels and environments is palpable even at just a cursory glance.  From small things such as the atmospherics of the villiage to the careful management of the players perception of time - the game begins mid afternoonish one day and ends around dawn the next; to seeing off in the distance places you are going and have come from, providing a sense of a larger environment and movement within it.\n\nThe sheer amount of content in this game is ridiculous; and not just retreading either (although even this feels fresh, as Seperate Ways demonstrates perfectly).   \n\nThough this game starts out as very survival horror-ey, it has morphed, by the end (and really by the mid point), into a full on action-horror game and, aside from 4's weaker controls, the gameplay by the end is identical to that of RE6.  Anybody who tells you otherwise is full of it.\n\nIt's hard to overstate the genre shifting success of this game.  As a horror game it's creepy - its body horror (a la 'The Thing') never gets old and is done creatively and with sheer gusto.  As an action game it created a new genre.  This game never feels old, it never seems to diminish, and has never been bested.",Recommended
"The hours on Steam are a fraction of the time I've played Resident Evil 4; prior to this release I played the Gamecube, Playstation 2, and Wii releases. This was the first Resident Evil I played, and one of my first M-rated game and I'm glad it was. Personally, and like popular opinion, this is one of the best in the franchise. \n\nThe game follows and pays homage to the older titles, while changing things up for the better. Its tank-like controls from the first 3 games is now bearable with the 3rd-person/over-shoulder camera, but adds some tension in combat. While some/large parts of the game are escort segments, Ashley's AI is relatively painless and isn't too difficult to manage(It's a breeze if you unlock a certain something). The visuals are dated after 10 years (Writing this review as of 2015) but manage to maintain the creepy silent hill-esque environment. The tension and atmoshpere of survival horror is definitely present, while keeping combat much less stiff than the previous. Progression feels good and replayability is definitely there. The weapons come in just the right amount and each feel different in their own right. The story is kinda cheesy, but with the ""virus/parasites"" at hand what can you expect. The extra gamemodes add a more action-y way to play while netting shiny rewards and expanding on some parts of the main story.  I don't to give anything away or spoil anything, but Resident Evil 4 is definitely worth picking up if you are already a fan of the series, played it before, or never played a Resident Evil game.\n\n\n(Also FUCK Regenetors, those things made me shut of the game the very first time I ecountered them)",Recommended

"Resident Evil 4 is a game full of character that I don't think many people have not heard of so I won't go over that. What I will go over are my issues. This version of Resident Evil 4 is... functional. Barely.\n\nRiddled with bugs and having optimisation problems that it blatantly should not, this should not have been released in the state it was and even now it's barely better. Don't expect to run this happily on a computer from around the time Resident Evil 4 came out. In fact, even a sub-par system from a couple of years ago will struggle with this. \n\nOn the computer I wanted this to run I had to set the resolution down several levels, run the game without the fancy HD textures it comes with and even then the cutscene audio was out of synch because the game occasionally dropped a frame.\n\nAll that said this is still the best way to play the game out of the box, allowing mouse aiming out of the box and coming with official HD textures as well as the correct button prompts so you don't have to figure out what exactly ""Button 6"" is during quicktime events.\n\nBeyond that, I like it. The game functions, there are absolutely no control issues and the mouse movement feels amazing. With the graphics turned down the game will run on less than stellar computers although because of a lack of recoding the cutscenes can go out of synch but I put up with it.\n\nBottom line is that if you want Resident Evil 4, this is Resident Evil 4. Ported over carelessly, but a little less so than the last time. Buy this game on sale though, the myriad of technical issues devalue it far too much for full price.",Recommended

"Downfall of Resident Evil series. If I wanted to review Resident Evil 4 / biohazard 4 game in short, it would fit perfectly. Sadly, I cannot do that. Before reading this review keep in mind one thing: I'm hardcore fan of old RE games. If you are just looking for normal review then skip this one.\n\nI decided to write this review after beating it on Pro difficulty level, once again, and after spending few hours playing Mercenaries. I spent many hours playing RE4 after it was released on PC (not Steam version), even more hours playing it on PS2 and beating it more than just few times. Steam's achievements made me want to unlock everything and even after beating it in 100%, I'm sure that I will play it few more times in future. Why then, if somebody spent so many hours playing and beating RE4, can ""hate"" this game? It's simply - because it started to destroy whole RE franchise. It's not a horror game anymore. There is no atmosphere of fear anymore. There are no zombies. There are no puzzles which would demand from you to read in-game documents, or use a little more of brain to solve something. You don't try to survive anymore. You don't try to save as much ammo as possible anymore. You don't save herbs and sprays anymore. You don't think anymore about things you get or store, since there is just one big inventory...\n\nEverything must expand somehow. If RE series stayed same after years would it be better? I know, and I'm sure even Capcom now understand, that there was a way for Resident Evil to be better game in this universe (Resident Evil Revelations). Why would I give Resident Evil 4 a positive review since there is so many things I hate about it? Because it's a great game.\n\nI don't treat Resident Evil 4 as part of Resident Evil games. I see it as something other than just another game in franchise. This way I can enjoy even something like that. I can compare it as much as I want this instalment to old RE games but that won't change anything. This won't also change the fact that it's a GREAT ACTION GAME.\n\nResident Evil 4 as action game doesn't disappoint in anything. It's amazing how fun shooting and killing Ganados' can be. Fights with bosses aren't also bad but everyone of them can be killed without much trouble. Collecting stuff to selling it to this strange merchant and upgrading weapons you love to use is fun. Since it's not a cheap thing to do, searching every posibble corner is natural thing. Three difficulty levels and special missions won't make adventure with Resident Evil 4 to be short. There is also one, most important, thing which is probably the best thing in whole game - Mercenaries mode. Most of my playtime I spent probably there. It's so simple and yet very addicting - you chose a character and try to stay alive in appointed time, trying to kill as many enemies as you can and do some kill combos for bonus points. If you will do great, you will unlock more characters. Mercenaries in RE4 are rather ""poor"" in content compared to Mercenaries in Resident Evil 5 or 6 but few years ago, when Resident Evil 4 was just realeased, it was enough for having great time. I remember how fun it was to share new tactics and scores on RE forums. There is just one thing which I see as negative. Even tho RE4 was upgraded to ""HD"" it doesn't looks so amazing and sadly works bad even on good PCs.\n\nAt end, and in short - if you love old RE games you will be disappointed in RE4 BUT if you also love great games, then you might enjoy it. Beside being a fan of old RE games I also love to play great games, so even with so many complains I managed to enjoy Resident Evil 4 / biohazard 4.",Recommended
"One of my favourite games of all time. Redefined survival horror into something I actually wanted to play. Always hated the static camera of the older games. Super atmospheric, interesting characters, creepy enemies, epic bosses and awesome weapons that feel so great to wield. \n\nI've had it on the Gamecube, Wii and now PC. Graphically speaking this is the best of the bunch. Otherwise playing on the Wii with the wiimote was the superior experience. It just fit so well. Mouse and keyboard does a decent job though. I've found it better than using a controller at least. \n\nAll the issues they had at launch seem to be gone now. Game looks great and runs at a solid 60fps. \n\nHighly recommended!",Recommended
"Of the GameCube original, or the PS2 port, this version is certainly the worst. Performance issues are almost constant, every cutscene has audio desync issues, and the game has a nasty habit to crash when opening doors seemingly at random. Inferior to the original in every way, not worth the stress at any price.",Not Recommended
"We all remember how stupid and yet how great Resi 4 was right? We all remember how godawful the PS2 port was, and how betrayed we felt when the PC port was instead a port of the Ps2 port from the GC version? So on PC when we should have had 60fps, and all the wonderful visuals that the original Gamecube version had, we got the godawful crippled PS2 version without transparencies, with 30fps and pre-rendered bloody cutscenes instead of in-game engine cutscenes?\n\nYeah. Well eventually Capcom worked out that this MIIIGHT have been a Bad Idea(tm). So now we have Resident Evil 4 HD Ultimate Edition on steam. This is a version of the game MUCH more in line with the GC version, and at nine bloody gig of HD space required, actually earns that right. The textures are fabulous, everything is crystal clear, it runs at a rock solid 60 fps and it even has native mouse and keyboard controls! What more could you ask??\n\nI mean aside from Resi 4 not being batshit insane and hilariously 90s action movie styled. Let's be honest, that's core to Resi 4 though. That's what Resi 4 is. It starts off with lovecraftian horror, and swiftly changes to a 90s action film complete with hilarious dopey one liners and useless screamy female sidekick/walking plot device. That's not going to change. If you bought this game or are thinking about buying this game, chances are you know precisely what you're getting, so the only thing you're REALLY interested in is how it plays and how it holds up against the Gamecube, or now, the Wii version (which by the way is the definitive edition of this game until HD Ultimate came along on pc)...\n\nSo here's the thing. I had a GC and I had Resi 4 for it. I then had a Wii and got Resi 4 for that as well and played the everloving dick out of it. the Wii version is by far the most superior of all the previous ports. It was recoded from the ground up and the Wiimote suited it PERFECTLY. It made the game much more comfortable to control and whilst you still had to wrestle with tanklike controls, it was much more enjoyable as a result, and the visuals even seemed improved a bit over the already beautiful GC version.\n\nHD Ultimate genuinely has fantastic texture work. A couple of the nice detail touches are lost from the previous versions (I personally think the SD wood texture is nicer than the HD wood tex, its more detailed, has more character. HD one is definately higher resolution but it lacks some of the detail :( ), and there are still some kind of ugly textures, but all in all it's a definate visual improvement over everything. Cutscenes are once again done in-game rather than pre-rendered, there's no fps drops or slowdown and you have all the lovely fog and shadows and everything from the proper versions of the game that the PS2/""PC port"" version couldn't/DIDN'T have.\n\nWhere the game falls down though is that whilst there is mouse and keyboard controls, it's still locked in that resident evil 4 style of control. To actually turn and move left and right you have to used A and D either whilst standing still to turn, or whilst walking forward with W to turn in that circle. I mean the keyboard layout is logical and well planned and there's not too many buttons to press, but you'd expect to be able to turn with the mouse, right? Nope, that's just for looking around you without turning your character, or for aiming wherever you want when you hold RMB.  It causes a little bit of cognitive disconnect which is a bit of a shame, but something that can be gotten used to.\n\nFurthermore the game lacks in options. Whilst it's genuinely an excellent port this time, it's still clearly a port. There's an option for subtitles but inless you are playing the game in another language, you don't get access to that option, and as such there's no english subtitles, which is especially a problem for those of us who are hard of hearing. Graphics options are limited to Resolution, ""Fixed 30 fps"" or ""fixed 60 fps"", grades of anti-aliasing, whether you want motion blur on or off (seriously always off, good lord, who wants motion blur??), and what shadow quality you want... Rather limited if you ask me. Oh, there is a ... largely pointless colour filter option, where you can have it in its normal colour scheme, or one of four palettes, which appear to be ""ghostly mist blue"", ""old timey sepia"", ""ridiculously shiny"", and ... well I think the last one's meant to be a more desaturated colourpalette so everything is a bit more ""realistic"" (read: gears of war MANLY BROWWWWNNN HRRRUUUGHHH SO HETEROOOO!) but my colourblindness probably means it just looks exactly the damn same as the game's normal colour palette. ... at least in the early sections anyway. I'll try it out in the more colourful sections later.\n\nAside from slight control problems and limited graphical options, and the lack of a subtitle functionality for the hearing impared gamers, I can definately recommend this. This is the port of Resi 4 for pc we should have had long ago. No need to mod it to actually make it playable, or to make the graphics less vomit inducing. It looks great, plays just like we remember, and is still resident evil 4, just the way you remember it and love it.",Recommended
"Absolutely amazing game. Great story, very nice atmosphere, characters are amusing, and stage design is well done. Good inventory system, nice guns that feel more than pea schooters, upgrade system for weapons is nice. Mosters are freaky and well designed just like the bosses. Almost everything in the game feel satisfying, slightly choppy gameplay at times due to port imperfections, but good enough. Highly recomend to any resident evil fan, a great combination of story, horror, survival/resource management, action, all together make a unique gameplay that remains solid from the start to the finish.",Recommended

"Stands the test of time as one of the greatest and most tense action games ever created. Tons of replay value and depth. \n\nPros of PC port:\n1. Tons of Mod support\n2. Extra visual features and upgrades compared to others including color filters\n\nCons:\n1. RE 4 does not favor keyboard and mouse, as quicktime events use the left and right mouse button, and the x and c keys. Also mouse sensitivity needs to be on max to feel remotely in control. \n2.Any and all menus can be affected with the mouse which is innaccurate and ruins the flow of the game.\n3. Only 2 standard settings for FPS, fixed 60 and fixed 30. Just makes me wish there was a happy medium between the 2 like 40-45 fps.\n4. The absolute inflated PC requirements. Particle effects in particular such as blood, water, and dust will indefinitely hamper your performance at the higher framerate. This is a 10 year old game, there is no reason only beefy rigs should run this game. The visuals don't even suggest that this game suggest a higher pc requirement. \n\nDespite these cons, the gameplay is still fantastic. That in couple with mod support definitely make the pc a good purchase either if you've played resident evil 4 before, or never got around to it.\n",Recommended

"I am going to attempt making this short and sweet.\n\nWhat can I say about this game - it introduced me to the series (better late than never). I have played it (in the PlayStation 2 version) and of course beat it so many times both normal and professional that it made me go back for more, it was very addicting for me. I have so many fond memories of this game dating back to 2006. I was very hesitant at first to play this game when I started playing it for the very first time, was not much of a fan of horror/gore games, you could say I was a 'scared little puppy' during those days. Resident Evil 4 absolutely changed that, like I have stated I was not much of a fan of horror/gore games but when I progressed more into the chapters I found my self imjected to the game, constantly playing for hours thus resulting me not being afraid of horror games anymore. Hard to believe but this is Recommended. Thanks to RE4 I decided to play the previous and later installments of the games. This lead me on becoming a big fan and also loving the series.\n\nHow is this a review? That is a very good question, I have no clue - just felt like expressing my love and gratitude to RE4.\n\nNow... do I recommend this game? Sure, if you don't mind the tank controls. Aside from that if you are a big RE fan and you have not yet purchased this game I don't see why you have hesitated this long on getting it. BUY. IT. NOW.\n\nThat is pretty much it, thank you for your time on reading this so called 'review'.",Recommended

I have a lot of fond memories of rocking this game on the Gamecube, and I was worried that playing it today, it wouldn't hold up. \n\nHowever, I'm happy to say that this is a great game, even without the benefit of nostalgia glasses. Yeah, the controls are a little clunky, especially today. And yeah, the graphics aren't 5 star quality anymore. However, the level design is great, the gameplay is fun, and I personally just love the charmingly goofy/awkward dialogue. Additionally, who doesn't love the merchant?

"I originally owned this game on GC ([i]it was the only reason I bought a GC...[/i]), played it several times through. Now I own it on steam and plan to do the same ([i]first run is always with the Red9![/i]). RE4 is a love it or hate it turn for the franchise, taking you out of the traditional survival horror perspective, and making it almost more ""first person survival"" as you never leave your character and can aim freely as well as interact with several parts of the environment. You're still on a linear path, but it's a ""explore this area if you want"" linear path. Unlike previous games where you had to time your head shots to ""close encounters with a shotgun"", or lost yourself as you walk around an awkward corner to wonder where you are on the screen. I'm a 80's kid and grew up on RE games. RE2 is still my favorite, RE1 would be better but I'm still scarred by the original cover and voice acting. RE4 is a excellent transition to what the franchise was heading towards.

The graphics and scenarios as well as cinematic were outstanding, as you wonder into the abyss and unknown terrains you can admire some beautiful scenes and really appreciate the games developed as it’s taken from the previous games from 1-3. With the Characters, bosses and the way the texture was layed out I would give it top marks.\n\n[b]Game play:[/b]\nThis game will have you on the edge of your seat and will test you reflexes to the max as you fight of Villages and guys with Potato Sacks on their head, Which when you hear the noise will get you shitting your panties if you don’t know what’s to come or even if you still do. If you were a controller player then its pretty standard with the aiming and shooting and activation buttons and will take time to switch to keyboard and mouse and vice-versa. \nThis game give you tons of puzzles, characters backgrounds, random Enemies and an amazing new way of carrying items as you are given a suitcase to carry out your items and Weapons.\nThe fun doesn’t even stop there.

"If you are a Recommended RESIDENT EVIL fan and worship the old classic games of the franchise. I tell you that RESIDENT EVIL 4 was not completely screwed up to this point. This game marks the end of an era in which capcom was still able to make good RE games. And After this title, all the sequels were nothing but recycled garbage. And even that they have improved the gameplay and the graphics a little bit, no Resident Evil game sounds as authentic as this one. Resident Evil 4 has a strong personality that conveys the nostalgia feeling of all previous games respecting its universe.\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nResident Evil foi revolucionário quando surgiu em 1996 como uma franquia de survivor horror no Playstation e Sega Saturn. Com a direção do criador da série Shinji Mikami, os títulos seguintes conseguiram se consolidar no mercado construindo uma personalidade forte no gênero tanto em termos de enredo, como jogabilidade e gráficos excelentes para a época.\n\nQuando a fórmula tornou-se no entanto um pouco desgastada, Shinji Mikami lançou Resident Evil 4 que surgiu com a árdua tarefa de renovar o estilo e trazer novas experiências para o gênero. Posso dizer que até aqui o game ainda mantinha muito da personalidade que fez do mesmo um grande sucesso, apesar de embarcar de vez em uma experiência mais ACTION e menos Survivor Horror. \n\nA história possui a maioria dos clichês dos blockbusters hollywoodianos e apesar de não ser extraordinária, ainda assim, quando inserida no contexto do game consegue trazer momentos emocionantes e de grande tensão, causando ao final do jogo a sensação de ter assistido a um grande filme de terror clássico americano. Resident Evil 4 mantem grande familiariedade com os lançamentos anteriores, pois muitos dos elementos antigos foram mantidos. Ainda é possivel usar a máquina de escrever para salvar os checkpoints, o baú de guardar itens para administrar munição e outros achados está presente, há ainda os puzzles e a possibilidade de investigar acontecimentos por meio de notas, agendas, fitas cassetes, vídeos e livros espalhados pelo mapa.  Além de tudo, RE4 expande o universo da saga para o enorme mundo 3d com muita qualidade e cuidado. E a maior parte dele se passa em ambientes escuros como mansões, calabouços, cavernas e fazendas afastadas da civilização, aumentando o clima de terror, mantendo os elementos de suspense e fazendo as pazes com os títulos antigos. Apesar da enorme mudança de ambientação e história, o ""Set"" é típico desse universo e consegue alcançar momentos épicos e cativantes a medida que o jogador progride na história.\n\nOs controles nesse novo game respondem bem e combinam com o estilo de jogabilidade. Parece que tudo se encaixa perfeitamente ao universo de Resident Evil e mesmo a movimentação do personagem sendo um pouco dura e sem agilidade, contribui para aumentar o nível de pânico e tensão durante os combates. Demora um pouco para conseguir se habituar, mas logo tudo flui intensamente.\n\nO jogo foi um divisor de águas no gênero survivor-horror e ação, trazendo consigo mecânicas de game inovadoras, como o campo de visão acima do ombro em terceira pessoa e os famosos ""Quick-events"". Durante a experiência de jogo, há a sensação de que o game não tentou forçar uma nova continuação, história e acontecimentos no universo de Resident Evil a fim de extrair novas continuações sem pé nem cabeça. E é exatamente por isso que o game consegue ser mais autêntico e agrada até mesmo os fans mais hardcore de longa data. Resident Evil 4 tem excelentes gráficos, aúdio de qualidade, bom nível de desafio e muita diversão. Pecando apenas no fato de não haver zumbis e na jogabilidade que com o uso do gamepad torna o game meio duro, pouco fluído e ágil na hora de movimentar o personagem. \n\nSendo assim, RESIDENT EVIL 4 é um excelente título para colecionadores da saga e não deve em nada para outros games de survivor horror já lançados até hoje, tendo gráficos que ainda encantam e uma experiência única entre vários games do gênero, sendo por isso a edição mais premiada de toda a saga.\n\n9.5\nNota Geral",Recommended

very good game no bugs at all recommended brings back old memories of the old resident evil franchise LOVE IT!,Recommended
For my nostalgia...Ashly...Ashly!,Recommended
"Bought it for the mods... wasnt many but worth the $10\nother then that, perfect game 10/10\nyou can even switch back to old textures",Recommended
"This game is classic, buy it right now.\n\nUPDATE: After playing more of the game, the game has a slow motion bug and which happens on any PC. Don't buy on PC, buy it on PS2 or PS3.",Not Recommended
"Absolutely love this game, my ps2 version has 29 total playthroughs on it and everything unlocked (as far as I know). Being the first resident evil game to use an over the shoulder camera and no shotty camera angles that cause complete terror and panic, the professional playthrough will cause enough of that anyway as you run through low on ammo for most of the game.",Recommended
"I would say ""For a fan this is fine""... however I'm a little disappointed.\n\nNot really a smart update on aiming and movement with this game, if you're like me and you've played 1, 2, 3 & 5.\n\nNot worth the Full price tag. So wait for sales, I guess, if you're That curious.",Not Recommended
"Nice HD port, maybe a little bit old but overall is a good game. The control scheme is confusing.. took me a while to master the control after that, well, headshot.",Recommended

"Resident Evil 4 is great game (in my humble opinion the best from Resident Evil series) but had terrible port for PC from Playstation 2. Resident Evil 4 Ultimate HD version recompenses all drawbacks, it has improved graphics and mouse support. Game is really long and challenging, it has a lot of puzzles and hard enemies. Controls are easy to learn and with mouse support it is easier than with game pad. Really great third person shooter with a lot of challenging puzzles. I recommend this game especially to PC players who were unsatisfied with original version published by Ubisoft.",Recommended
this game is one of the unique games.. I really enjoyed every moment playing it. + Added games are so much fun. you should certainly buy it.,Recommended
"I enjoyed the game on PS2, so I figured I'd play through it again on PC. Big Mistake. The loading screens are long, the screen stays black for 30-40 seconds when just reverting to your inventory, and random choppiness in framerate happens out of nowhere. Resident Evil 5 and 6 ran completely fine, but this game issues somewhere.\n\nOne of my favorite games though. It sucks the PC client is just bad.",Not Recommended
"I bought it on GameCube, I bought it on PS2, I bought it on Wii, I bought it on Xbox 360, I bought it on PS3, and now I bought it on steam. Why don't I just give Capcom access to my bank account at all times? Seriously though, amazing game. Beaten it more times than I'm proud to admit. 10/10",Recommended
"I was really excited to finally be able to play this game, but I cannot recommend it. My computer can run any other game perfectly, yet on this one it feels like your character is running in slow motion and the controls seem like they are lagging. I tried adjusting the settings to no avail. It feels like everything is a second behind or something. I'm not sure about the technical reasons behind this, but it makes it seem like it wasn't formatted for PC properly. Until this issue is resolved, keep your money for something else.",Not Recommended

"Another Resident Evil HD remake, but I really enjoyed this one just like the others. The textures are nice and crisp, the gameplay is fantastic, and its just plain enjoyable. There is some extra content to enjoy. Really the only thing that made me cringe was the multitude of quickaction cutscenes. They're so random and lightning quick and the consequences are instant death. Never really understood this mechanic. Its a great addition to the collection for anyone who wants the classics in their library.",Recommended

"After I enjoyed all of the RE titles (including 5&6) I have to say that this isn't the best RE as many people claim it is, but still not the worst one.\n\n+The bosses are pretty gore and you always need to find a tactic to kill them.\n+The game trolls you in different ways. (cough...cough...I wouldn't headshot enemies if I'd be you cough...cough...)\n+HD is pretty good.\n+Limited inventory.\n+Soundtracks are very well written.\n+Creative in a japanese way.\n+New terrifying enemies such as the Regenarators who are nearly immortal. I don't want to spoil the others.\n+Now you have to worry about an other person, too, not just yourself...\n-...but that person sometimes just sits down waiting to get killed.....WHY?Or even she may get stuck and can't even a carry a fucking herb. I was praying to get her taken again for as long as possible.\n-For me it was a very long time to get used to the controls with a controller.\n-Bugs.But not the funny ones, when a character flyes or something like that. No, for example a boss stucks in loop leaving you unable to progress or quick time events those are impossible to do etc....\n-The story is pretty flat, seriously even 6 has a better story.\n-The audio is out of sync during cutscenes for many people.\n-1/2 of the game tries to be survival horror (and horror) and the other 1/2 of the game tries to be a good action game, but it really feels neither of them.\n\n[u][b]In overall:[b][u]After all I can still recommend this game. Yes it's Recommended that neither it's a good action game or a good survival horror, but if you're lucky it can be really fun(but I'm sure it will be fun for almost everybody who is at least a little bit interested in this game), but it's still can't be the best RE game in my opinion. If you want to play a hardcore survival horror with good graphics play RE REmaster (or the Revelations games, but they're not that hardcore). If you want to play a good action game play RE5.",Recommended

Re4 One of the best games of all time and still the best Resident Evil game ever and well every thing is so right about this game. The combat is good as is the story and the quick time events are some what hard on a keyboard but hey still fun as fuck. If you love Resident Evil then get 4 best one out of the all.,Recommended
"i love resident evil. the controls are bad, but thats okay. BUT the grey-screen bug . everybody who is playing the game with a laptop will have a grey screen after chapter 1 of 23 and cant go on. there are no fixes which means you cant play the gsme. so dont buy it",Not Recommended
Very well designed game.\nJust a shama both the plot and setting make no sense.,Recommended
"Easily the definitive port of RE4.  Main issues are the animations. Some of them are at 30fps at times and it looks funny when you're into the game. Other than that, this is a well put together port of Resident Evil 4. I'm glad Capcom finally gave the PC a proper version. The original was awful.",Recommended

"Great game. The last of the good Resident Evil games. This version has HD textures and can be rendered at 1080p 60fps which is the best you can get with this game. It totally remains a great game nowadays and if you've never played make sure to try it out. Oh, and if you want an even better experience hook up a gamepad. This game was made for them, not for keyboard and mouse.",Recommended
"Resident Evil 4. The series that changed the genre of survival horror at its finest now on PC. This version is not the crappy port from the PS2 version but this is the HD rerelease port from XBOX 360.\n\nPros:\nResident Evil 4 at it's ultimate form! 1080P @ 60FPS!\n\nCons:\nNahh.. Not really an ultimate form. Although sold as ""Ultimate HD"" version, there are noticeable low res texture on most areas. There are also noticeable slowdowns on some occasion within the game. Lastly, if you play it on keyboard, quick time events can be very difficult to execute.\n\nConclusion:\nAs a longtime resident evil game fan, I would definitely recommend this game. I played it on the PS2 before and I played it again in the PC. Despite the shortcomings of the port, its definitely worth a revisit of the classic series.",Recommended
"Let me start this shïte off by saying that outta my many hours of playing this game, I've only had it crash or fûck up ONCE. And that was (evidently) not a reproducible error or anything.\n\nSeriously, the sheer stability of this game alone makes it a digital architectural masterpiece, and that's just mentioning that one freakin' subject!\n\nMoving on, the gameplay is either difficult or easy to explain. Ever played Dead Space? 1 or 2. You have? Great. You'll feel right at home. Just aim for the head instead-a the arms, otherwise it's basically the same kinda gameplay.\n\nSound? Well, shït... there's nothing to report there. It works, no glitches or issues, but it's not something you really nerd-fap to or whatever.\n\nStory? Ehh... it's cheesier than your mum's cooch, but it works. Kinda tongue-in-cheek (or at least I hope so... it's Capcom, after all. The lousy hacks...)\n\nLength? Lemme put it this way... ever played NG+ in Dead Space? SAME THING. AGAIN. I swear, DS must-a ripped RE4 off BIG TIME for ""inspiration"". Simply put, you can play the game over and over with the same savefile a hundred billion times if you gots the time for it. (I sure as hell don't.)\n\nSo, bottom line... is it fun? Yes. Yes it is. But is it worth the price? Ehhh... maybe. If you're a massive fan of RE4 (and really, let's face it, that's the only GOOD one in the entire freakin' series!), then yeah. It's worth it. Hell, a freakin' GameCube copy of it'll cost you at least twice that of Steam's askin' price! And then there're the sales...\n\nThe lack of subtitles (unless you play with japanese audio) is just fûckin' retärded, but fortunately the voice-acting is good 'nuff to simply not warrant subtitles as a necessity. It's got full controller support, so us PROPER RE4-players will feel right at home, too. So yeah. Definitely good, but not perfect. 90/100",Recommended
"Resident Evil 4 is my favorite game in the series!\n\nWith over 30 playthroughs completed on PS2, 360, PS3, and now on PC, it is safe to assume that I know quite a lot about this game.\n\nAlthough not a perfect game, RE4 is the game that changed the old Resident Evil’s clunky controls for good. Also the voice acting is actually not as cheesy as the older games. The brand new 3rd person shooting mechanics made the game much more enjoyable as well.\n\nIt is also the first game in the main series not to feature regular zombie enemies that walk slowly towards you. The newer enemies are infected Ganados that can offer quite a challenge during your first playthough.\n\nThe only major flaw in this game is the horrible AI (a.k.a Ashley).\n\n9/10.",Recommended

"So the most (well maybe one of them) Hated RE game got a HD Port to PC. \nI owned the Nintendo Gamecube version when it came out thinking it was exclusive which it was till the dumbdown (graphics wise and performence) version yet more content on the PS2 came out.\n\nIts a great game but not a great RE game although we can hate it but still enjoy the story either way.\n\nThe PC Version is by far and I mean Steam not the physical Disc release that does really work... Steam Version is to me the best one out there.\n\nThe Game is a little old now mind you. The graphics are a little upscaled i wouldnt say the Textures are redone they look little tweeked. the fact that we can run the game on 1080p and in 60fps requires little Hardware specs (opinion) is quiet neat.\n\nIts a Great game but again not a great RE game (also why us Fans from the begining do not like this particular game)\n\nGameplay Decent enough plays well with the full 3D Background.\nStory - Pretty Solid although some plot holes in its script (luis mentions a sample virus at his police HQ... kinda strange )\nVoice well the voice actors did a wounderfull job on the game\nSound - There are times the sounds cut and do not fade properly I think this was just bad if not the worse thing ive seen in this version but its quiet minor.\n\nPrice VS Length of playing - Well thats up to you really should take a good few hours to beat the game and there is lots to do . treasure hunting, collecting bottlecaps and of course unlocking EVERYTHING... just like Resident Evil intends you to do.\n\nOverall I do enjoy the game as a Game. \n\nTry and get it on discount though for those that have had the game before (this is my 3rd copy on 3 different platforms)\n\nOtherwise Action gamers please beware yes the controllers are tank but thats RE for you and this is just a heads up.\nOld Fans we all have played this you know what you in for if you havent played it then please do.. not for the hate but for the love of RE you cannot go into the series without playing this game in particular.\n\nIt is also the game that influenced games like Gears of War if you didnt know that (the gameplay).\n\nEnjoy!",Recommended
"I just wanna put it out there that I am apparently the only person in the world who doesn't dislike the port but just plain dislikes the game. I don't think there's one negative review that doesn't say ""I just wanna start by saying I loved this game on (insert sixth generation console here)"". I'm not really sure what I dislike about this game, I just know I don't like any of it, as much as I wanted to.\n\nHeadshots just aren't a thing in this unless their heads happen to explode, effectively making the pistol entirely useless, for a good while at least. It turns out kicking them with Leons stronger-than-bullets roundhouse is the most effective way of killing them. I'm aware that they're not technically zombies, they're just extremely hard headed Spaniards but still! It seems the only good zombie game out there that isn't just trying to be a barrel of laughs for the whole family is The Last Of Us (again, I know they're not zaaahmbies!) \n\nThe controls are abysmal in pretty much the same way all of these old games are. You can't aim and move at the same time and even when you do aim it's like Leon has Parkinsons and god help you if someone throws a grenade at you (or a stick of dynamite 'cos you're in a farming village and apparently farmers always need to blow shit up), moving out of the way of one of those suckers in a tight space is like trying to dodge a fart on an escalator and even if you do manage to turn around it seems to take ten minutes before you can start moving in that direction. Oh and the camera, don't get me started, it's just awful. I played with a controller by the way, any moron who plays a game that was designed for a console with a keyboard and mouse and then complains that they don't work as well as they think they should shouldn't be allowed outside without adult supervision and a high-vis helmet.\n\nI think overall it just suffers from Capcoms trademark crappiness, the only games of theirs I like are the first two Onimusha games. For some reason every game has the same style, where every main character has a pretty boy haircut and is almost completely void of a personality and comes alongside a ridiculous plot.\n\nI suppose I don't like it mostly becuase I didn't play it when it came out like everyone else so I have no rose-tinted specs to view this through. That or I'm just venting my anger 'cos I haven't slept and I found out my wife's cheating on me... I lied, I don't have a wife... maybe that's why I'm venting. Point being, I wouldn't recommend buying this game if you've never played it before (which would make you an anomaly it seems). I would suggest trying out someone else's copy as a demo before you make any decisions, otherwise just don't buy it. Thankfully that's what I did, I damn near bought this a while back.",Not Recommended
"[h1] Resident Evil 4 / Biohazard 4 [/h1]\n\nOne of the most critically acclaimed of the franchise, [i] Resident Evil 4 [/i] brings a lot to the table for hardcore fans. Whether it's a Recommended survival-horror experience, an in-depth story, or just a ton of content, Resident Evil 4 has it all.\n\nThe game begins lightly, but only for the first half hour of gameplay. Once you meet the deadly horde of Ganados in the village, the game officially begins to go downhill, in a horrifyingly good way.\n\nYou're placed back into the shoes of an ex-cop, Leon S. Kennedy, and this time-- his job is to rescue the president's annoying daughter, Ashley Graham. She gets herself into quite the situations throughout the story, but that's okay. Leon just keeps rescuing her, over and over. \n\nThis installment also introduces quick-time events, and if you're a fan of this game, you'll know that they sometimes get annoying. But then again, they're managable, and that's okay. There are plenty of enemies you can fend off with your large selection of weapons. For instance, you can take down one of the game's most horrifying enemies-- the Regenerator, with a high-powered rifle that has a special scope equipped. The game is well-crafted, and simply one of the best in the franchise, and there's a reason that Capcom decided to put it on almost every platform known to man, because the players think that it's one of the greatest in the history of Resident Evil.\n\nUpon completion of the main storyline, you're greeted by a few new game modes: [b] Mercenaries, Assignment Ada, [/b] and [b] Seperate Ways. [/b] Both Seperate Ways and Assignment Ada are add-ons to the story, in a sense, while The Mercenaries is a minigame that has you playing as different characters that each have different loadouts to accumulate as many points as you can within an allotted time. There are also different stages to the minigame mode as well, with each stage granting a new character if you get over a certain amount of points.\n\n[b] Assignment Ada [/b] is a minigame, that has Ada Wong, one of the main characters in the Resident Evil series, collecting all 5 plagas samples. It wasn't really the best of the three unlockable modes, but it's decent enough, and that's good. Once completing that mode, you get a reward for use in your next playthrough of the main story of Resident Evil 4.\n\n[b] Seperate Ways [/b] has you playing as-- yet again, Ada Wong, and she has numerous missions throughout the five stages. One of the missions, is to [spoiler] kill Saddler [/spoiler] and retrieve the sample. There is also another unlockable item for use in the main story of Resident Evil 4, and with both of the unlockables combined, you'll be unstoppable.\n\n[b] The Mercenaries [/b] is yet another minigame that has you playing in five different stages, with a set of characters that you can choose from, with each giving you a different loadout. For example: Wesker has a magnum that can take down enemies with ease. Krauser has an overpowered bow along with a TMP. There are plenty of characters to choose from, so take your time and see which one is better for you. Once again, you need to unlock them, so be aware of that. You start off with Leon S. Kennedy, and you can start from there.\n\nOverall, this game packs a ton of content for each player, and right now it's on sale for $4.99 USD. That's basically a steal, considering the amount of content, along with the amount of playtime that's included with this gem. \n\n[h1] Should you play? [/h1]\n\nDefinitely. This game is truly one of the best in the Resident Evil franchise, and it deserves all of the attention it garners.\n\n[b] Overall score: [/b] [u] 9/10[/u]\n\n[b] Hungry for more reviews?

"Back when Resident Evil 4 came out on the Gamecube, it was easily one of the greatest games of all time. It is by far the best game on that console and up there for best game that console generation. They ported the game out to other consoles like the PS2 and the Wii and their versions were pretty darn good, but when they ported the game to the PC, it was a trainwreck. The controls were not at all decent for a mouse and keyboard setup and the game was such a massive disaster that most people don't even know that there was a PC version of RE4. \n\nThis new version, the HD remaster, does indeed look better, but most importantly plays better. The gameplay may still bother some people (not being able to move and shoot at the same time), but for most people the gameplay is what made RE4 the great game that it is. It straddles the line perfectly between being an action game but more importantly a tense, horror/survival game. Keys that you can rebind and great mouse support, you can finally play a decent PC version of one of the greatest games of all time. It may not have aged all that well, but for those looking to replay it or experience it for the first time, this is now a viable option.\n\n4.5/5",Recommended
"Still as good as always, but the port has its problems, at least at the moment of this review.\n\nI've experienced some very inconvenient crashes at critical moments, especially after some cut scenes at the end of chapters, which made me redo a huge section of the level more than I would like to. There is a current issue with frame rate drops that seem to happen at precise points in the game, like the Church graveyard in the first few chapters. There is around 10-15 specific places in total that will slow down your frame rate to a fraction of the usual and make your action in that place look like a Michael Bay movie. These are the two main issues I've had and they look like the kind of thing that could be fixed in a future patch, so if you plan on buying RE4, check the patch notes and game forums to make sure you'll be getting what you're paying for.\n\nEven with those problems, you can see they at least tried to put some effort into porting the game. Controls are well mapped, tutorials have been changed so that they show what you gotta press on your keyboard and mouse instead of still showing console buttons as some other ports do. You get to choose between the old textures or the new, HD ones. There's a few graphical options and a few more if you're willing to mess with the game files, which doesn't take that long at all.\n\nThe good part about RE4 could sort of go without saying. It's fun as fuck, one of the greatest third-person shooters ever made. The story and setting aren't that good for a Resident Evil game, given the fact that you'll seldom be scared of anything at all during your playthrough. If you liked RE 1, 2 and 3, and want more of that, you might be disappointed. Takes around 10 to 15 hours to clear the game for the first time and, from there, there is a lot more to do. You get to replay the campaing with a lot of new perks and items as a reward for clearing the game, and there are two extra modes to play: The well known Mercenaries and the Assignment Ada mini-games.\n\nThe issues with the port almost make me want not to recommend the game, but I know better than to keep you from playing one of the gems of the third person shooters. Give it a try, it's worth the effort even with the crashes and slow-downs, and if they ever fix that, it's a flawless game.\n\nGameplay - 10/10\nSoundtrack - 9/10\nGraphics - 7/10\nContent - 8/10\nChallenge Level - 9/10\nReplayability - 10/10",Recommended

I love the game and the only thing I was negative about was quick time events. I just found that having 60fps made a lot of QTEs require double the effort and some enemy animations were much quicker than at 30fps, likely due to the game engine being tied to frames per second.

When I found out a Steam version was available, I jumped at the chance to play it once again. After playing it though, I noticed there were a few noticeable hiccups in this version. For one thing, you may to lower the frame rate down; otherwise it feels like you're playing it in slow motion. Next, hand grenades never worked for me and kicking in doors was essentially non-existent (which is a pain once you run into a swarm of enemies.)\n\nOverall, it's still a great game but it's picked up a few bad habits in the transfer.",Recommended

"Super Mario Bros, The Legend of Zelda, Goldeneye, Halo; What do these games have in common? They’re all revolutionary video games that have altered the way we play and perceive games and gameplay. [i]Resident Evil 4[/i] certainly belongs in that list for many, many reasons.\n\nIt takes much from a company to invent the wheel twice. The Resident Evil series is known for having codified and popularised the survival horror genre in games. This game though, [i]Resident Evil 4[/i] laid the foundation for modern survival horror games, third person shooters, and other action games that we see and play today. Before [i]Resident Evil 4[/i], third person shooters were a mixed bag. The camera was a mess, or it gave you a terrible view of the action. [i]Resident Evil 4[/i] fixed all that with a streamlined over-the-shoulder-cam, aiming mechanics and challenging gunplay. Stiff controls were remedied with the ability to dodge on reflex button presses, now known as the much maligned quick time events. Finally, whatever we classify as cinematic gameplay these days was perfectly proportioned and executed in Capcom’s 2004 behemoth masterpiece.\n\nMany of the aforementioned innovations are mainstay today, but back then they were earth shattering. It is a testament to wholesome game design. Not only are the mechanics polished to a shine, they complement and substitute each other. QTE-s don’t overstay their welcome and they have weight and purpose to them. The camera keeps you, the player, in the game and as a result inside the character; forcing you be careful and actually giving you a reason to prevent grave bodily harm. \n\nAnd bodily harm is ever so present. You’re Leon Kennedy, one of the few survivors from the Raccoon City outbreak and now in the employment of the secret service. Tasked to retrieve the president’s daughter from a desolate rural region in Spain. What you uncover goes beyond the horrors of zombies and corporate scheming. \n\n[i]Resident Evil 4[/i] uproots the series established formula and takes survival horror to survival terror. The sheer viscerality of the presentation makes for a non-stop freight. Horrifying villagers drone at you in the dark while their heads make place for disgusting parasitic flails that take precarious aim to keep at bay. The horrifying rumble of a chainsaw soon makes place for the utterly blood curdling terror that are the late game enemies that approach the limits of how much a person’s senses can process while trying to get the girl home safely. The music is frighteningly effective at enforcing the sense of unease. The mild bliss of the piano that plays in save rooms is the only respite. Especially considering the sound design on some of the enemies. Just the breathing of some of these freaks just makes you want to turn your PC off and sit in a corner; crying in abject terror, afraid of the nightmare that you will have when you go to bed later that day. \n\nWhat’s more? What else can a game so amazing offer more? Imagine a season’s pass worth of extra material. Except that you don’t have to pay extra for it. Two extra chapters, a cruelly addictive minigame, new game+ and a whole plethora of costumes and weapons are all included in the single price. It is hard to get such a deal these days, and it shows how far publishers have fallen in terms of packing their releases with content. Ironically, Capcom is one of today’s greatest offenders.\n\nStill, the game has aged. The controls are stiff, the textures are muddy at times and the occasional slow-motion might present itself when the lighting engine has to bend in ways it wasn’t designed to. However, do not forget, that [i]Resident Evil 4[/i] is a full package. Everything is balanced in and on itself, creating a wholesome and undeniably enjoyable game that can keep you entertained even ten years after it first saw the light of day on the Gamecube. [i]Resident Evil 4[/i] must be played. Passing up on it is an insult to videogame history and an insult to yourself. You’d be a fool for passing up on a near divine piece of gameplay that is equally hellish in atmosphere.",Recommended
"\n+ Graphics - Not the prettiest in the world, but I don't hate it. In fact, I quite like it. \n\n+ Gameplay - Mowing down hordes of enemies in this game feels very satisfying. Good variety of weapons.\n\n+/- Characters - Funny and likeable main character with a helpless and oftentimes tedious and annoying schoolgirl. One iconic merchant. Interesting but mostly one-dimensional side characters. Almost everyone else are either the ""generic bad guy with a high position"" or the ""ooh, so mysterious"" character.  \n\n- Quick-Time Events During Cutscenes - Ugh. \n\n+/- Controls - Hit or miss, it depends on the person. It's a hit for me.\n\n+/- Story - Pretty meh, imo.\n \n\n+ ""Over here, stranger."", ""Ahh, I'll buy it at a high price!"" ""Come back anytime.""\n- ""LEON! HEEEEEEELP!""\n\n\n- Sound options - For some reason, there's no volume options and I feel that the music is a bit too loud for me  \n\nA very good game, in my opinion. I love this game, despite all of its faults. I used to play it all the time way back when my PS2 still worked. I'm a bit surprised that it held on pretty well at 1080p. Unfortunately, with the success of this kind of more action-packed survival-horror gameplay, Capcom decided to emphasize more action with its subsequent games. To be fair, RE5 and 6 were still fun, but they strayed so far off the RE formula that I almost forgot they were RE when I was playing them.\n\nI highly recommend this game.",Recommended

"RE4 is easily one of the most interesting and creative games of its day.  The monster drops, the store, the cut scene interactions, a great story line, and graphics that were beautiful for their time.  \n\nThis steam version has it all...except it is not compatible with a wired 360 controller.  After some research it doesn't seem to work with any types of controllers other than the basic mouse and keyboard (even that seems spotty).  Great, fantastic, amazing game...but it is too damn difficult with one hand-held controller.\n\nSpecifically, controller stick dead zones take up most of the center stick, while shooting off in only left/right or up/down directions when only a hair outside the dead zone.  Diagonal directions don't seem to exist.  These conditions make walking, aiming, zooming, and basic looking a real struggle for Leon, the protag.  While he hunts for the president's daughter, he moves a bit like a nervous drunk.  \n\nKeyboard and mouse are better, but the aiming is iffy.  However, the developers did a great job of keeping many of the basic RE standards the same, and revamped a beautiful game.  I just wish they spent a bit more time fine-tuning their look-focus programming.  Or at the very least, allowing an option to turn off the controller so that we can use our own programs to set up some easier sensitivity controls.\n\nI got this on sale for about $4 so I'm not too bummed out.  I can deal with it til they figure out a patch to correct the control sensitivity.  Again, with better interface, this would be a bargain at $30.  But I would be a bit upset if I had dished the regular $20 for the control scheme available so far.\n\nAt regular price, not a good buy.  Best just to buy the original on GC or a PS.",Not Recommended
"First off I absolutely love this game. I've had it about 5 times across 4 platforms (Gamecube, PC original version, Wii, PS3, and PC again) and I loved every second of playing. Speaking of game time, I've played through it somewhere around 50 times and i still have fun with it. Apart from the main game there three minigames you can unlock by beating said campaign. Assignment Ada, Mercenaries, and Separate Ways. Separate Ways is more of its own campaign than a minigame. After completing these minigames you unlock other things such as new weapons and costumes for the base game (plus a weapon for separate ways as well). What I'm getting at is that this game has lots of replayability as well as a great story. If you don't have this game, GET IT. It doesn't have to be this version of this game but get it.",Recommended

I'm not the only one with this problem, but I'm still in a minority.\n\nAfter I managed to get it running at a playable framerate (about 28-30 FPS) the resolution was 1280x720 and I had to turn off AA and advanced shadows, along with the ability to have 60 FPS. Fortunately the HD textures still work so it looks a little better than the version released on the PS3 and 360.\n\nAlthough I have no problem playing games on a low resolution due to the fact that I just now got a 1080p capable monitor (and an old one that is blurry at that) I can fully enjoy this game because it is REALLY good. Unfortunately, however, I cannot recommend it because I know other people will not be as forgiving as I am.\n\nA company like Capcom, with all of the money they have don't have a single excuse for releasing a botched port like this.

"The orginal hybrid of action and survival horror. Before RE5 Gears of Warsed everything, removed the humor and traced and retread RE4 (But with fun COOP and excellent tech) you playws as Dude Americana as he fucks up a place full of blonde hating assholes/zombies/ganados (Which totally aren't just zombies that can hold things.) in Europe where everyone speaks broken badly acted Spanish in addition to dropping ammo even though they don't use guns in an attempt to save the Presidents idiot daughter Ashely who dresses like a 5 year old and is one mocha latte away from being a basic you know what. That said seriously the Spanish in this game is RE1 levels of wrong. The games level design is amazing and while not the first it pioneered the over the shoulder perspective. It still holds up and looks great for 04/05 (Especially because it came with lighting and mouse aiming this time unlike the 2007 port by Ubisoft or Source something that was removed from Steam but not forgotten by me). \n\nThere is a lot more action this time around but Proffesional difficulty will keep this from devolving into a mindless shooter and it will keep you on your toes. It never gets dulls thanks to the well done set peices and changes of scenery. Investing time and ingame money on upgrades for weapons still feel like they are worth your time even after all these years. Not to mention the Merchant is an excellent character and mechanic that never appeared in future titles. I'd buy a game with him in it at a high price! \n\nThe few issues I have are the later levels feeling a bit ""we gotta finish this game already"" and the dated quick time events which while invented by Shenmue were popularized by RE4. Stuff like running from a boulder in the middle of a small village feels disjointed and isn't particularly fun the first, second or third time let alone whenever I replay it years later. The presidents daughter could be seen as a slight negative but having played it myself I feel that the claims were greatly exaggerated. Shockingly she is less of a pain in the ass then your armed ""partner"" Sheva in RE5 and she gives you a wider FOV when she's with you making her useful too. Rarely if ever does she get in your way or get captured unless you are REALLY not paying attention. She does get captured in a lot of the cutscenes though you fucking cucks. \n\nPick up this game at whatever price it's at because it's worth your time and money.\n\nMy review of Resident Evil 5 (The product as a whole) can be seen here:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198056186683/recommended/21690\nMy review for Resident Evil 6 can be seen here:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198056186683/recommended/221040",Recommended

"Disappointing. At present, there's a massive problem going around with the game that leaves it damn near unplayable.\n\nKnown as the ""Slow Motion bug"", basically the game plays like you're walking through treacle. This glitch has affected systems both low and high, and no amount of reducing graphical quality or anything else has changed performance, which I find distressing considering I can play games like Mass Effect with no problem.\n\nThe first time sign that you're a victim of this glitch is that cutscenes desync from audio. From there, Gameplay is just painfully slow.\n\nNow, my system isn't the most robust by a long shot, but it's rare I run into a game I legitimately can't handle, especially considering the damn Wii can run it. Further still, there are users who can run the Crysis games experiencing this problem.\n\nReading over the forums, Capcom is aware of this issue and are looking into it, but there's no 100% effective fix at this point in time, so I'm stuck with a game that has no guarantee on ever working. Looking forward to that, as, these problems aside, the game is fun as all get out.\n\nI would recommend if the game could work without such a glaring fault, but at this point in time, I just can't.",Not Recommended
"Having played the original PC version, which was utter cuhrap to say the least, I pretty much enjoy the changes, here's a little insight on what is way better than before:\n\nControllers now have, if they are ""original"" ones, proper Button images in-game, which will not get anyone confused with the 1-15 scheme the original had.\n\nThe mouse aiming is perfect, a huge improvement over the original which did not feature mouse support at all.\n\nThe graphics did, unlike the title suggests, not really get an HD upgrade, they are basically just scaled versions of the original ones. The characters however have received a whole lot more of dem sexy polygons and look better than before. Good improvement.\n\nThe original had huge probs with the performance, that has also been improved, everything runs stable on 60 fps for my mid-tier rig I am currently using (you can find specs on my profile if you'd like to compare).4\n\nSo in conclusion, if you never played RE4 before or if you are looking for a digital copy of the game, you can get the HD version without second thought, it's worth the money IF you enjoy RE4. A lot of people don't like RE4, so if you dislike the game in it's original version for what it is rather than the technical side, nothing has changed. \n\nOther than that, positive review, because I like it very much :)",Recommended

The game i played long ago on the playstation 2 was much better then this. I have a new monster of a computer so I finally have been able to download and play games through the PC. Havent had any trounbles with any of the games that I have bought through Steam until now. After haveing downloaded Resident evil 4 I noticed that every thing was slow(What i mean by that statement is that From moving around or even just the cut scenes everything moved at half the speed). Tryed to delet it and redownload it but its always the same. And the slow movement effects the cut scenes to the point of unsycing the audio from the mouth movement(Felt like watching a Japenesse movie with english audio) Hilarious for 5 mins then makes you angry haveing known the awsomeness of the other platform you played it on. This was a real let down and has infirated me to no end. !!!!!!!!!!!!!DO NOT BUY THIS GAME FROM STEAM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. Luckily i bought the franchise pack and the other resident evil games work fine.

"By far the greatest release of Resident Evil 4 to date, and the best looking one as well. Sure, the postprocess effects might not be as pretty as the Wii Edition's, but you'd have to actually try hard to find the difference.\n\nEven so, there are graphical mods that make this game even better.\n\n- A PostProcess/Shaders mod to bring the game's shaders up to par with the Wii Edition's.\n- High resolution texture mods for all playable characters besides Ada (Though it's in progress)\n- ESPECIALLY look for the Resident Evil 4 Remaster project at re4hd.com, it's truly a masterpiece and should have been what Capcom included in this game from the get-go. It's yet to be finished, but growing at a steady rate.\n\nControls are x100 better than the previous PC Edition's, though most RE4 hardcore fanatics will likely want to stick with a controller, as it just suits the game better. I myself have no controller, so I use the keyboard + mouse controls, and I must say, it really isn't bad. It's definitely playable, and in some instances better, as the mouse control tends to get headshots much easier for some reason.\n\nThe only gripe I have with this game is some of the frame issues, such as the rifle reloading animation playing in 30FPS, and the water itself also running at 30FPS. Cutscences also sometimes run a bit choppy, though I really think this is because of the texture and shader mods I use.\n\nIn conclusion, Resident Evil 4 Ultimate HD Edition is by far the greatest Resident Evil 4 release to date, with the Wii Edition coming second, and the Xbox 360 coming in third. \n\nIf you enjoy the Resident Evil series, buy this game NOW.\nIf you enjoy the horror game series, buy this game right NOW.\nEven if you have owned every version of Resident Evil 4 to date, still, buy this NOW. This is likely the final release of the game, and thanks to Steam's digital distribution, it'll always be with you, unlike a disc.",Recommended

To be honest, I didn't find escorting Ashley as bad as some bring it out to be since you can hide her or tell her to wait at a certain spot so she doesn't get killed.

"Resident Evil 4 is a great game, a total classic that redefined the survival horror genre for better or for worse. I mean, without RE 4 to pave the way we wouldn't have the RE 5 and 6 we have today, right? Hmm, okay I do have some problems with it and I do think it's overrated, but I still like it and can recommend it to anyone who hasn't played it yet.\n\nBut my God, this is one awful, awful, awful, AWFUL port!\n\nIt's beyond inconceivable that this game that looks the way it does has such high system requirements. GTX 560? 4GB of RAM? What? Why? How? It barely looks any better than the Gamecube version I played back in 2005! The steam store page promises upgraded textures on characters, backgrounds and objects. Yeah, on SOME of them. Most textures haven't been touched at all and stand out even more when next to their more defined counterparts. Let's see what other lies the store page has for us.\n\n""A complete visual overhaul has been performed to bring this revered title to the highest graphical quality ever.""\n\nWhat the fuck are they talking about? There's no overhaul, and definitely not a ""complete"" one. This is just a now 10 year old game that's outfitted in 1080p with some very selective high-res textures (not even all that high-res either). There's also AA now, thank fuck. Doesn't make the game look any more dated. There's also a ""motion blur"" option. Ever wanted a game to make you feel like you're piss drunk? There ya go. Seriously, that is NOT motion blur! They added some filters too that look awful, but I guess it's harmless after all. And subtitles that don't work. Yeah, really! The subtitles option doesn't work. It's greyed out in the menu. You can only turn them on from the config files. Fantastic. \n\nDon't get me wrong, my problem isn't that the game looks old, that's okay with me. I do have a problem with the fact that it looks old yet still has such high requirements (again, GTX 560, what the hell) coupled with an engine that absolutely can't handle frame drops. One thing you're going along with constant 60fps, next thing you know you're in a room with a bit more effects going on and suddenly it's slow-mo city. Thinking about lowering the frame tresshold for such on occasion? Nope, can't do it during gameplay, only from the main menu! You can lower the resolution and hope that does the trick.\n\nHere's a pet peeve of mine. Obnoxious and ugly film grain effect that you can't turn off unless you mod it out. Stop doing that! I hate film grain, give me the option to turn it off!\n\nSo it's a 10 year old game with very minimal updates that runs like shit unless you have the high requirements that it needs for some reason I can't even fathom. Face it, this game has no business being on pc with it's horribly un-optimised engine. You may say it's better than nothing, I say get any other version than this one. The Wii version has the same content, and though it doesn't run at 60 fps you won't have to worry about it going all matrix on you. Or you could just set it to 30fps, but what kind of scrub would do that, huh?",Not Recommended

"[i]The end of an era and the beginning of another...[/i]\n\nPrior to Resident Evil 4, previous games in the series were known for it's isometric levels, tanky controls, claustraphobic environments and limited (but scary) zombies. In 2005 Capcom changed the formula and released Resident Evil 4 which began the action series as well as inspiring games such as Dead Space.\n\n[h1]Plot[/h1]\nYou play as Leon S. Kennedy, a former police rookie (resi 2), now US secret agent tasked with rescuing the president's daughter (Ashley) from a group of cultists. In the remote european village, Leon discovers that there are far greater forces at play here and a sinister plot which threatens the world.\n\n[H1]Gameplay[/h1]\nGameplay is the main highlight here. The game is presented as a third-person shooter, like later installments. Levels compose of areas which the player must go through until they reach the end. Each area has enemies and traps hinder your progress. There are a wide variety of enemies including, but not limited to: dogs, melee/range guys, flying insects etc. Further more, there is a wide cast of bosses and mini bosses which each require different strategies and tactics to takedown. To assist you, there  are typewriters which you can use to save the game. A merchant may be also located in the area, which allows to to buy new weapons, upgrades as well as sell item like treasures to. Such weapons include pistols, magnums, snipers, smg, shotguns and grenades (explosive, flames and flash). Ammo is not sold by the merchant, so you need to preserve what little you have and scavenge the area for more. It is highly recommended that you only stick to upgrdaing 2-3 weapons as it is impossible to accumulate enough money to upgrade them all. Like many resident evil games, you have an inventory that is used to store items like weapons, attatchments, ammo and herbs. You have limited space, which can be expanded via upgrades. At the end of the level a cutscene will play signalling the end of one level in the chapter and the begining of another. I completed the campaign in about 18-20 hours, but there is plenty of replayability here with new difficulties and playing with only certain weapons (as well as newly unlocked ones). Completing the campaign unlocks a new difficulty, new weapons, new costumes, raid mode, theatre mode, the mini game :""Assignment Ada"" as well as the expansion 'Seperate Ways'. One of the negative points I found with the game (especially with 5) were the quick time events. Such events occur so quickly that it is difficult to press the correct keys on time, which usually results in death (especially during cutscenes) or taking alot of damage. At on point in the game I was forced to lower the FPS to 30, in order for my 'button mashes' to register in game. Such events I found detracted the game, and ruined the overall flow of gameplay. What was further frustrating was that the key inputs would be randomised so it is difficult to predict which were the right keys to press until it was too late.\n\n[h1]Audio[/h1]\nThe sound is great. Weapons sound powerful. Voice acting ranges from decent to bad. Leon's voice as well as a few characters are decent. While ashley's voice is irritating. Music is played when enemies are present in the area and only turns off when all enemies are defeated. This feature is indicates when you should be vigilant or relaxed.\n\n[h1]Controls[/h1]\nControls are passable. The game uses tank controls, meaning that you can't move and shoot at the same time. It is much more clunky than resident evil 5,rev and 6. You can switch the mouse control schemes to original or modern, which affects how fast you aim with the mouse. movement is slower than resi 5,rev and 6, however this is compensated by the fact that enemies are much slower than later entries in the series.\n\n[h1]Graphics[/h1]\nThe graphics range between decent to subpar. The HD release improved some of the textures in the game, such as some trees. However, other textures were left untouched. Furthermore, the character textures have been improved slightly and are less rigid. You can choose to switch beteen the HD and old graphics at any time. There are also a few colour filters available from the get go, which change the look and feel of the game. Overall, I found the graphics worster than rei 5,rev and 6.\n\n[h1]Extras[/h1]\nBesides the main campaign there is also: Mecenaries, Assignment Ada and Seperate ways. If you are unfamiliar with resident evil, mecenraies is a mod first introduced in resident evil 3. You select from a range of characters which each have a unique loadout of weapons and equipment. The aim is to survive against waves of enemies until the timer reaches zero, whereby you get extracted to safety. Each map hold a variety of crates, herbs, ammo etc which can be collected. You start with only one character selectable (Leon), with new characters unlocked when you earn enough stars in each stage. Compared with resi 5 and 6, there is only a limited number of characters and stages available. Furthermore, unlike later entries, you can't play this mode with a friend (ie no co-op)\n\nAssignment ADA is basically a mini game unlocked after completing the main game. You play as ADA (obviously), in a non-canon story whereby you are tasked to collect virus samples located in the area. Unlike the the main game and seperate ways, there are no save points in this game mode so you have to complete it in one run. This also forces the player to conserve ammo and look for herbs to keep in the fight. There are enemies in each area that you have to take out. At the end of the mode, you will face a boss. Completing this mode also unlocks a new weapon in Seperate Ways. Should you die, you will have to start from the very begining of the mode.\n\nSeperate ways is basically an expansion, where by you look into Ada's motives in the main game. You play as Ada Wong (resi 2), a Chinese American agent, working for a secretive organisation, tasked with retrieving a sample of the virus. The levels are set during the main game, showing how she came to be in the main game. You start with a set of weapons, which have already bean leveled up a bit. Unlike Assignment Ada, you can save the game by accessing type writers. You can also buy weapons and gear from the merchant, but you are unable to upgrade weapons. It is shorter than the campaign and yet longer than Assignment Ada. Completing this mode will unlock new costumes and weapons in the main campaign as well as cutscenes to view in theatre.\n\n[h1]Final Thoughts[/h1]\nIf you want are a resident evil fan or want a good action game with more horror elements than what resi 5 and 6 had to offer and don't mind, quick time events and old control schemes, then resident evil 4 is right up your alley.",Recommended

"Upon its original release in 2005, Resident Evil 4 was met with great critical acclaim as one of the industry's greatest hits. After ten years and six re-releases on different platforms, this opinion still holds Recommended.\n\nResident Evil 4 involves more action than survival - and more tension than horror - in its gameplay. The game is a major departure from the franchise with its focus on gunplay and shooting mechanics. With a wide variety of weapons and plenty of opportunity to use them, it has great replay value.\n\nIt will take some initial effort to adjust to its awkward movement controls, but otherwise, Resident Evil 4 remains a fantastic experience.\n\nRecommended. 9/10.",Recommended

"Chances are you've already heard of this game and how big of a deal it is, so I won't take up too much of your time.\n\nThere isn't much I can say that already hasn't been said.\nIn a survival-horror series that was starting to stagnant from subpar spin-offs, RESIDENT EVIL 4 breathed new life into the series by locking the camera to over-the-shoulder (as opposed to fixed camera angles), having an attache case inventory, and introducing QTE's. Today, none of this sounds too ground-breaking, but in the PS2/GameCube era, these were bold new mechanics to put into a Resident Evil game. And they're executed perfectly.\n\nWith tense action, fighting off wave after wave of bloodthirsty mobs, an intriguing original plot set apart from the rest of the series, all the while pitted in an oppressive and horrific atmosphere, RESIDENT EVIL 4 is a tricky but effective combination of chills and satisfying action.\n\nThe PC port is nailed perfectly, with clean graphics and tight controls, so that fans of the original or newcomers to the series can enjoy the same game released many years ago.\nThough some of the dialogue and acting is cheesy or lame, and some fights are dauntingly hard, RESIDENT EVIL 4 is a fantastic addition to the survival horror fan's library.",Recommended

" Resident Evil 4 holds a special place in my mind, and I almost hesitated to replay it, but if anything it seems better compared to modern games.\n++ The environment progression is clearly directed, but never feels linear, since you can backtrack pretty far back if you missed anything. There are items hidden in the environment that, instead of the useless random stuff littering Assassin's Creed, have a direct use. There are hiidden blue medals to shoot and unlock a special gun, and tons of treasure. Some of it is only good for selling right away, while some give you a choce; certain items have slots for specific gems, and you can either sell it immediately or wait and sell it with gems attached for [b] MUCH [/b] more. The environment itself is full of little details bringing it to life, and despite the deliberately limited color palate manages to be interesting to look at, ranging from villages, to lakes, to castles, to a prison complex.\n++RE4 is intelligent enough to know how silly it is, and is filled with silly one-liners and cheesy dialogue. It had the good grace to ditch the big mess that is the RE canon for a standalone story. The story itself is  not much to write home about, but it never tries to be.\n++The gunplay is great, since enemies respond to being shot, and there's incentive to do anything beyond head shots, since shooting legs may make them stumble, and there is a strong variety of enemies, new ones introduced with each 'act'. Some will have tentacles shoot out of their heads unexpctedly, some throw weapons (which can be shot down) or explosives, some use fire, etc. SInce you can't move and shoot at once, you have to pay attention to positioning as you manage your limited ammo.\n++The bosses are all great, most of them being hinted at and built up before hand and manage to both look cool and be fun to shoot (just look at Chief Mendez). Quite a few have a slight optional puzzle element that can make the fight easier, or something you can do to make it easier before hand (free the dog in the beginning, for example, and it helps with a later boss).\n++The only major complaint is the QTEs, particularly those in cutscenes that lead to you dying if misses. They don't rear their heads [b] too [/b] often, but when they do it'sunbelievably frustrating (though I guess people that play more modern games are used to it by now, to an exent).\nRE4 holds up beter than most of the games that cribbed its style, despite the much derided stop-to-shoot combat mechanics and intrusive QTEs. It's on 5 consoles and Steam and it's cheap, so there's no excuse to not try it. you won't regret it.\n9.5/10",Recommended

Want to know what esle is fantastic? The fact that this game has all the content from the PS2 and Wii  versions further adding more replayability and gameplay hours. You'd be finding yourself playing these little modes like Mercenary mode and trying to survive the onslaught or you'll be playing the story for the 20th time in a row on higher difficulty. It's important to note, however, that though this game is considered Survival Horror, it is not exactly scary... well, safe for the first encounters with the Regenerators that is. But old school Resident evil fans might not get the scares they look for when playing a Resident Evil game. Regardless, its solid gameplay is more than enough to make this game a great purchase and the amount of content you have access after beating the game increases its value in general. Highly recommend!",Recommended
"Although I definitely recommend this game, as it is a classic, I have a few issues that are bugging the hell out of me.\n\nI used to own this for the Gamecube, and a lot of the ""HD"" textures seem half done, or not changed at all compared to their low-res counterparts. Leon's jacket seems hardly different. I've seen much better, higher res textures developed independently and available for free download (the Epsilon/Darkplaces mod for Quake 1 comes to mind).\n\nAlso, they bound actions to X rather than A, without enough customization to swap the two. This left me with a rather confused thumb, since even newer console games have you pressing A to pick things up. And though I am proficient in games with WASD controls, keyboard and mouse are not an option for a game like this, regardless of customization. They should have let you set individual buttons for both keyboard and controller. It's nothing I can't get used to, but it's still very inconvenient. \n\nIf you're new to RE4, then you probably might have a better relationship to the controls. But if you're a veteran, beware of missed button presses.\n\nThough it is indeed a HUGE step up from the initial PC release from 2005, it's still very lacking for a ""remastered"" game. They could have done so much better like they did with the more recent RE1 remaster.\n\nI almost want to say it isn't worth the 20 bucks I spent on it. This game is a classic and deserves better. But as a fan, I still think people should buy it because it's full of action and awesome gameplay (with the exception of escorting Ashley, the annoying little twerp).",Recommended

I like the story line, and music.

"After just completing the game moments ago tonight, I can safely say this is a great game I had a lot of fun with. To be honest, this is the first Resident Evil game I've played in the series, so my review is based on this game alone without knowledge about the others. In this game, you're an American agent known as Leon Kennedy who is sent to a rural village in Europe to rescue the President's daughter known as Ashley Graham from this sinister organization known as the Los Illuminados. Of course, it's not just a simple rescue mission, as it is soon found out it goes much more deeper than that. Without going into spoilers, the game revolves around trying to rescue Ashley and escaping safely, but at the same time, being drawn into and having to stop an organization with their plans that threatens the entire world.\n\nI've never played the original version of this game, so I can't speak on differences, how this is better or worse, etc. That said, I found this game to be pretty good and solid. Playing this game, I got the feel from it that it was made several years ago, in terms of graphics and gameplay. Despite that, I found the game to play good. The story and characters were the highlights of the game for me. With characters, I can praise the good design, believable dialogue/personality, and more. With graphics, I can admit that they weren't state of the art like some games released today, but then considering this is an HD remake of a game released several years ago, it's understandable. And even with that, I still thought the graphics to be good with that considered, as I was able to be taken into the game and it's world, story, characters, and more. So basically, while I found the graphics to be showing their age, I did still find them to be impressive. And honestly, I wasn't a huge fan of the controls at first with character movement and camera, but as I played more of the game, I got more used to it and it became more comfortable with me. I also found the game to have an excellent variety of weapons, which you could also upgrade and have some customization with them. \n\nOverall, I give this game my two thumbs up and a recommendation from me to anyone. A great game that I enjoyed until the very end and wouldn't mind playing again sometime down the road.",Recommended
Still the best Resident Evil game to-date.,Recommended

"An HD remake of one of the greatest games I've ever played. The graphics look pretty good and the lighting is much improved over the vanilla 2007 version. The HD textures of the unmodded game however cannot match the image quality of the modded HD textures of the 2007 version. So the most signifcant improvement is the 60fps (if your PC can handle it though)\n\nM&K controls are awesome once you get used to them, and if you don't mind to adjust them manually till you find your best settings. The Mouse control  is very responsive and the aiming is very smooth. Those who suffer from Mouse responsiveness issues I suggest them to adjust the sensitivety as the default setting is very slow. \n\nOne of the downsides of this version is that it requires a hefty CPU to run at 60fps -(you need at least a CPU that is based on Nehalem architecture from Intel (First gen Core i5s/ i7s) or a K10 CPU from AMD (Phenom IIs)  to have 60 fps)-. However it is not hard on any high-end or mid-range graphics card that has released 5 years ago or later.\nI played the game on 3 cards and all of them managed to get constant 60fps at 1920x1080 8x MSAA and all settings on High : GTX 470, HD 7950 and GTX 780 Ti.\n\nI highly recommend this game, I give it a 9/10.",Recommended
"so yeah re-evil 4. i watched yovideogames play though this game twice (xbox 360 version and then ultimate HD version on pc) and i loved every minute of it. after watching them and then so many others play this game; i simply had to go out and purchase it for myself and expereince what makes this game so great myself. this game is fun. I means seriously fun, every minute you are always exploring, blowing zombies heads open with your shotgun, listening to some corney one liner Leon happens to spit out or just simply being scared. Now i know this game isnt the scariest int he franchise and is more akeen to an action game, but the whole game in its entirety just makes you want to go back and play the game again and again. next thing i plan on looking at is resident evil HD Remastered. 8/10",Recommended

"If you somehow missed it, you now have no excuse. I'm not entirely sure why the title for Steam is in all undercase, but that obviously doesn't effect the gameplay. Which is mostly unchanged, besides the upgrade from a controller to a mouse + keyboard, which was somehow beaten by the Wii version's motion controls, which may be the first and last time I say something along those lines. Anyways, RE4 (RE$ if you leave the shift key pressed, which actually says a lot about its release history, doesn't it?) is kind of a cultural phenomenon for gamers, being hailed as some kind of gaming valhalla that no other game has ever reached before or since by reviewers and obviously being very popular among about half of the RE regular (REgulars?) fanbase and many gamers in general. It's not the best game ever made, and it's not the worst RE game ever made, nor is it the best, but it is a very, very good and solid gaming experience in MOST aspects. Obviously, Ashley can be a pain to work with but I've seen worse and at least Ashley stays behind you mostly, hides when there's a dumpster to shove her in, or stands still when you tell her to. If you don't own a console and didn't play the abominable PC port back when the game first came out, now's the time. It finally works, although the graphics aren't as HD as advertised.",Recommended

"One of the best games I have ever played and definitely one of the most influential in my life. This was one of the first games (Other than Super Mario 64 & Super Mario Sunshine) I've ever played and really dumped hours into in my early years of gaming. Other than being absolutely wonderful with gaming mechanics but it perfected the third-person over the shoulder camera angle. This new innovative angling of the camera gave this game the winning seat in the entire franchise. The economy works well in this game, is not buggy, and you can not really glitch your way to unlocking everything in a short period of time. It also rewards you for beating on higher difficulties and replaying the game. I've beaten this game 10 times and I still find amusement playing it again and again. Most titles I can never find myself coming back too but this game was definitely one I'd gladly sit around and play all day. While it is ok on the computer, I had my most fond memories playing on my gamecube but I am still glad that valve had published it to Steam. While also having a huge influence on myself it has also had a huge influence on fps and other genre's of games. At times, it may seem dumb but still to this day it scares me. When I first downloaded it for steam I was scared to go into the starting village knowing I'd be facing Dr. Salvador. It literally took my 3 whole days to man up and finally go in. Even those game is older it has aged quite well and still remains good to this day. I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys an amazing and nostalgic game.",Recommended
"Resident Evil 4 is my favorite Resident Evil game of all time, and playing it in the gloriousness that is High-Definition is a blessing. I don't have a PC that is up to date for newly release game, but it still looks amazing in HD. The nice thing is that there is nothing changed to the gameplay. You are playing the exact same game in HD in 60fps. My PC can run the game at 60 frames, but it runs beautifully in 30 frames. If you never played Resident Evil 4 yet, this is the best way to experience one of the best suvival horror games ever created. With out a doubt, I recommend play this version over any other version.",Recommended
" I've finally figured out RE4's game pattern. Limited ammo, and an overwhelming number of enemies placed in such a way that you need to spend your limited ammo in the most effective way possible. The game isn't so much as scary as Dead Space is. Leon has legs of steel and can behead stunned enemies, suplex enemies, etc. On top of the over-the-top action and lack of enough ammo that would make this game an action game, Leon has to escort someone most of the time. So, the game also becomes a bit of time-management, as you gotta kill the enemies fast enough so they don't find and take Ashley, as well you gotta try and plan your movements so you don't have to spend a long time just to make sure she's safe. Also, no more cramped areas, night, zombies, or demolished cities. Now it's in the day time, in ""not Spain"", in the countryside, facing off against mind-controlled farmers, and a little person who has a form of super worm that he found as a fossil. \n\nSo, the original mystery that Umbrella had in making their viruses and experiments is now gone as a new virus worm can be found anywhere. \n\nLook, I won't deny that I like this game, but when you look at what people praise it for, the whole thing really shouldn't work. It should have fell apart as soon as you met Ashley. Even then, the fact that a benevolent infected person is willing to give you ammo to slaughter all the people that I assume he knows is equally puzzeling. When you look at the mysterious stranger's eyes, he is infected. So, that should mean he's trying to kill us. But, he's not. Why? I understand that without him, we would have to find guns and upgrades ourselves, natural progression, etc etc. But, he shouldn't even be a character in this game if he's infected. At least Leon and Ashley have a reason, they have a few days before they become mind-controlled, but this mysterious stranger should be trying to dig into our brains with a hatchet.\n\nAlso, Hunnigan. She is, for the most part, in constant contact with Leon throughout the entire game on his ""not CODEC"". But, if the president's daughter was kidnapped in what can only be guessed as an act of terrorism and bio-terrorism, is sending one rookie (Leon) on a rescue mission by himself a good idea? For all we know, Leon could have survived Raccoon City by luck, and as soon as he trespassed in the man's house (first 15 minutes), he'd have a hatchet right in his head. I understand that sending in an entire battallion of troops is an invasion, but what, can't spare 5-10 more CIA agents to rescue and stop a huge act of potential bio-terrorism? \n\nOkay, look, before this gets nit-picky, I do like the game. For the fact that the story can be unraveled easily is the game's biggest flaw. But, the action and atmosphere of hopelesssness is what this game gets right. Also, the traditional lack of ammo is what an RE game needs to have (lookin' at you RE6) until you get to the boss fight when you need a large amount of ammo (lookin' again at you RE6).",Recommended

What came after re4 where action horror shooters(re5,re6)  this game was the gap for future horribel resident evil games  they should have ended the series at 4 it would have been one of the greatest franchasis if they did not evovle into re5 re6. That being said re4 is one of the best resident evil game with just enough horror and action mixed in Leons adventure of saving the United State of America's president daughter from some cult kidnappers that have some sort of virus.

"Resident Evil 4 is easily in my top ten games of all time list, however this specific edition feels to be the weakest in Resident Evil 4's long history of ports.  First thing to know is that the ""game"" is in HD, but not the textures, or effects.  This is not an HD remake.  They merely took the original game and had it render in 1080.  The textures are jagged, and muddy, and the 1080 only brings out the age of RE 4's visuals.  If you have never played RE 4 and don't own a Wii then this is certainly your best chance at playing a legendary game, but is in no way an ""Ultimate"" version.  RE 4 deserved a proper HD rerelease with full HD texture replacements, where as this is nothing but the original PC release being bumped from 720 to 1080.  Hardly worth a new subtitle.",Recommended

"I love RE:4 kick ass game, memorable as all hell, on the flip side, this port sucks. go onto the forums and you'll see all that's wrong, but for those who can't be arsed, here's a list of all that I've encountered so far:\nEnemy's that bug out and infinately reach into their back pocket and pull out nothing. This is something that stems from an spawning glitch, they throw a sickle or something or a bomb and they try to spawn another one but fail so they keep trying.\n\nA rare glitch is an enemy running into a wall, only found this a few times.\n\none really annoying glitch is a severe delay between me shooting their head off and the las plagas parasite emerging, so they just walk at you, the problem with this is that you can't kill them and they're just getting in your way.\n\nGrenades don't work unless they explode on contact, if they don't, they don't go off at all. again goes back to that item spawning glitch were it refuses to spawn.\n\nanother glitch with the las plagas is sometimes the thrashers stay in the floor once they're dead. so you just see this thrashing tentacle.\n\nonto Boss glitches\n\nLe gigante, he has one pain in the ass glitches and one that's not so bad, one were his walk animation screws up and he's taking one right step to advance and one near game breaker were he can pick up both leon and ashley and hold them forever.\n\nDe lago, only one glitch but it's an annoying one were it only spawns spears during that one attack were it goes quiet and it's goes all jaws on you. every other time than that you don't get shit, this slows the fight down massively because you can only hit him once in a while. \n\nfrankenstien with a beard can get stuck in an attack animation loop when he's in his legless form. \n\nduring the ski lift part I was laughing because all the enemies were stuck in that pulling out the arse animation and I didn't have to do anything but enjoy the view.\n\nThe merchant sometimes doesn't have a body under the coat.\n\non paper these glitches are the most harmless but you haven't heard it, her glitches are purely audio, that's all I need to say but, Whenever leon drops down from a ladder or any kind of height she will say back to back reguardless of how far away you are, even if you're still at the foot of the ladder. I remember her being annoying but I hope to God that's a glitch. \n\nand then it comes to the one that caused me to stop playing, all of these glitches pissed me off to varing degrees but the one were the truck gores you in were I had to stop. there's a moment in the game were a truck is going down a narrow passage and you have to shoot the driver in the head before he gets to you, you know that glitch I mentioned about the las plagas parasite never emerging and they just walk at you, the driver is immortal and you die every time. after trying a load of times reloading and scanning various forums I couldn't find any way to fix this.\n\nI remember none of these glitches on the PS2 or GC version of the game, I'm not even half way through and I've ran into all of these sodding glitches god knows how many are still there, idk what the hell happened to the PC port but someone fucked up royal and there needs to be a fix. When atleast half of these glitches are fixed including the game breakers, when that's done, I reccomend this game 100%, until then don't get it.",Not Recommended

"There isn’t much to be said about Resident Evil 4 that hasn’t already been beaten into the ground. All these years later it is still one of the most lovingly detailed, polished, and meticulously put together games of all time. Easily Mikami’s best work and undeniably the game that shifted the paradigm of horror games for years following its release (for better or worse). What is lacking in horror is made up for in tense encounters that encourage quick take downs and efficient use of supplies. \n\nThe story is pure ham - even by Resident Evil standards. The series may be known for jumping the shark, but Resident Evil 4 takes it to new lengths. A Napoleonic little person, bizarre cults, a giant automaton, and cringe worthy one-liners are just part of what awaits the player. It is all good fun, however, and the game seems as if would be far less without its off kilter humor as well as personality.\n\nResident Evil 4 itself is a lengthy game, the main story alone shames most anything that comes to mind in terms of variety and content. In addition two scenarios featuring series regular, Ada, as well as the much loved Mercenaries mode round out the offerings, if that was not enough the game offers a slew of unlockables. Even at full price the value proposition is excellent.\n\nThe PC version itself feels a bit perfunctory. That said it runs at just any resolution one would expect at a rock solid 60 FPS. In addition the game supports the Xbox 360/One controller without issue. This version of the game is easily a far cry from the original PC port. This reviewer personally experienced no issues with the game. A must have for any fan of the genre or even third person action games in general. Highly recommended.",Recommended

"It's not as good as the Resident Evil Remake port, textures are no where near Hi-res, aside from some floor textures, character models,  and water which doesn't show up most of the time and will lag the game noticeably.  It also has a nasty habit of slowing down for no reason what-so-ever at random moments, and often after exiting the map screen quickly.  This is supposedly because it runs on CPU and Not GPU.  I don't experience the audio desynch that everyone else seems to get, but I can't turn on subtitles, and trying to return to the main menu from the game crashes it.  \n\nApparently. the dolphin emulator does a better job than this port, and unlike this port, has proper hi-res textures that this game simply does not have.  If you've never played this game, you might be able to tolerate it's quirkyness, but if you have, it might not satisfy you.  Worth sale price at least, but it's dissapointing that a port is inferior to an emulated version with a few graphics patches.",Recommended
"Speaking of Resident Evil 4, I want to just yell at each corner - a masterpiece, a revolution in gaming, etc. I note a few words about the game itself. What you need to know to modern gamers:\n- A game which is ahead of its time, even now, the game is played just fine;\n- For the first time people start the game will be a surprise in the form of Challenge;\n- A huge variety of gaming moments;\n- An interesting story.\nAnd much more. It makes no sense to talk a lot as it is necessary to look for another gamer who has not played this game.\nAbout remaster - it is excellent. Here is excellent, reworked control, which finally did sane on the PC. Level graphics - GC (that the praise remaster) with some twists such as filters, shadows and mastareys 60 fps .... and it's all a matter of fact. And it's wonderful. This is all the exact same game we all love, in the best version, and I recommend it to all, an unequivocal masterpiece for the ages.",Recommended

I also think that this game works perfect on a gamepad.",Recommended

"Resident Evil 4 is still a really fun game and easy to recommend. Naturally, the story is ridiculous, but that's part of the campy horror fun this series is good at. This is the game that killed the classic, scary RE style. The focus has clearly shifted much further in the direction of linearity and combat. Although, there is still some back tracking and puzzle solving going on. It still has a really cool, spooky atmosphere for most of the game. There are a lot of amazing, fantastic monsters to fight and big spectacle moments.  The dirty little secret about the 'modern' RE games is that the tank controls never actually went away. Only the perspective changed to the over the shoulder view and made combat less clunky. This game is like an amusement park ride or a summer blockbuster movie. It starts of slow and by the end its non-stop action. There's a lot of game here too. The first play through took around 20 hours to finish. There's also extra side stories to play through and the arcadey Mercenaries mode, which was also challenging fun. Multiple play throughs are encouraged as the game allows you to restart from the beginning with all the gear you acquired from the first time through.  There's a lot of different areas to see and explore in the game. On the down side, the last  level of the game is kind of lame. Krauser is the definite low point of the game. This guy is all QTE's all the time. This game has way too many of them. It just makes it a chore to fight that guy. After his boringness comes a string of random arenas fighting a bunch of lackluster battles.  The final boss isn't that great either. \nThe graphics are a bit of a mixed bag. It certainly looks better than it did when it was released a decade ago. I believe the cut-scenes were redone using the in-game engine and that was a smart choice. The resolution is a bit better, but sometimes that just makes some of the ugly textures really stand out. I understand some people have had technical issues with the game. For me, the game ran smoothly for the most part. The only real noticeable dip in frame rate was when reloading either sniper rifle and it never crashed on me. It's by no means a perfect game, but it's still really fun and I had a great time revisiting this romp.",Recommended

"I haven't finished the main story yet, although I did many times in the past on the PS2 version of the game, but I thought I’d write a quick review on the game so far. first of all I have noticed 2 locations that used to be accessible but are no longer accessible, both are in the castle area, one is the hedge maze (Leon used to be able to access that right? it's not my mind screwing with me???) and the other is the tower just before you enter the castle (if I remember correctly to get across originally you had to clear out that tower right? well now you don't have to). Also I just experienced my first crash of the game, I think it was right before your buddy in the chopper is supposed to be shot down, but the cut scene never started, it just crashed as I entered the door. Also in the same area before the crash I had to restart 0nce because when I jumped down off of the catwalk I fell through the map. Altogether the game looks great, I just wish that they hadn't dumbed it down/ made it easier in some spots. Also some of these glitches I never ran into on the old PS2 one so I am wondering what those are (although they were probably there and I just never experienced them). Another thing is I am NEVER out of ammo in this game, I am putting that to the fact that I can aim better on a PC than on a console and therefore I am able to save ammo. So far I would recommend this game to other players; I would just ask the developers to please think about releasing a patch to fix it!",Recommended

It was during the mine-cart ride, fending off zombies that jumped down onto the carts, armed with a shotgun from one cart away, blasting Dr. Salvador and three other zombies in a perfect blast radius that I thought to myself ""Wow, this is actually fun.""\nAfter climbing part of the tower, and reaching the point where I could now drop barrels to roll down and hit the cultists coming up the stairs with them because in the back of my mind, I was saying ""DK!""? Fun.\nWhen I managed to one hit kill Salazar with a bazooka I'd been saving after weakening his armor shell? That was fun.\nLooking back, harpooning the fish monster? Difficult, because by then I still hadn't mastered PC controls, but fun. \nDo you remember the last time you actually had fun playing a game?

The Umbrella Corporation has gone bankrupt due to a crash in stock sales after it is revealed that they are to blame for the incident. Leon S.

Now Leon must find and rescue the president's daughter and uncover a plot that could lead to ultimate global destruction.\n\n[h1] Gameplay [/h1]\nUnlike its predecessors Resident Evil 4 is an over the shoulder third person action game, with a little bit of survival-horror here and there. Like the other games, you can't walk and shoot at the same time, which for many newcomers might seem annoying but actually makes for a lot of tense moments while fighting the games many enemies. The game is split into three parts and five chapters. With the last part being a bit weaker than the previous two, it's still amazing. The game has a few boss battles, which are all very tense and satisfying to battle. The unlocked Professional mode, is a though challenge, but a lot of fun for hardcore gamers.\n\n[h1] Conclusion [/h1]\nAs you can see by the hours that I've played this game, I love it. I played all the Resident Evil games and Resident Evil 4 is the one that made me play all of them.

"There's not much to say, it's the same good game, with solid gameplay, only a bit more shinier. And I do mean only a ""bit"" more. Feels like CAPCOM really didn't put much effort into making more textures, Since only character/enemy and maybe some boss enemy textures were redone, a few weapons and items look better, but I'd prefer more fidelity in making the whole game look better, rather than some of it's parts. There are a couple of guys doing a WHOLE retexture project, but as of now, it's still ~40% done at the moment. Might take a year or more for them to finish it, so I'd say do not rush it, and get it at a better sale price. 60fps setting does make the game run very smoothly, combat feels even more responsive than ever and it definitely helps with the signature clunky ""tank"" controls.\n\nHowever, if you by some random magical reason haven't played Resident Evil 4. Buy it, it's really worth it's price, especially for someone that hasn't played it at all.\n\nIf you by chance do get this game, but want a little bit more out of the visuals, and don't want to do any heavy modding, you can always use SweetFX 1.5.1 (latest version). You can easily get this even from Skyrim Nexus, since you only need the base files. Either use the default settings, or browse in google for some player created presets (found at least 5-6 in the first seconds of searching) and find a preset to your liking. \n\nI highly recommend you check out http://residentevilmodding.boards.net/board/62/re4-modification-releases\n\nThere are numerious ENB presets, SweetFX presets available. Also get the shader fix, which makes the game look A LOT better. \n\nEven if CAPCOM is lazy, doesn't mean that you can't make the game look better with a little bit of elbow grease.",Recommended

Eh. I like this game because of the storyline but so far it's slow on my PC.  Haven't tried everything as of writing this review to make the gameplay faster. I'll tinker with it.  It's such a good story I won't say anything just get the game. If you have Wii grab it. \n\nRight now it's all Matrix style for me. Leon crashes through windows super slow and the glass flies out (not bad lol) but I'll work on speeding this up. Anyway get the game. It's half game half movie.,Recommended
"This game is really good. After playing the ps2 version first, i had extremely high hopes for this game. For the most part my hopes were high for a good reason. Great graphics, great gameplay, better controls than the ubisoft port way back when. All good things. But with all good things, there is bound to be bad things. My main gripe is the models for the items in the inventory. Their textures are so low !! Im not sure if its a setting im just missing or something but for me, they look horrid. My other problem is that some ogjects, you can just walk through. An example of this is outside of the house where you first see the merchant. The pole outside is there but you can walk through it. Whats up with that?!?! one other thing i dont like is that the game feels a bit too easy than the originals. I do like that items dont dissapear after a cutscene. Now This game for me gets a solid  8/10. If they patched the textures and made certain things unable to pass through, my rating would definitely give this game a 9/10. I reccomend this to players who havent played this game before and want to get in to the series. I also reccomend it to players who played the originals and would enjoy seeing it in HD. Lets all have high hopes for resident evil 1 HD and lets never play resident evil 5, 6 or raccoon city.\n",Recommended

"When I bought Resident Evil 4 for PlayStation 2 back in 2006, I was really immersed to the gameplay itself. Resident Evil 4 was vastly different compared to the previous Resident Evil games, moreso by the fact that gameplay elements were vastly different. The protagonist Leon can interact with the environment in many different ways, be it kicking down the ladder to impede Ganados, pushing the cabinet to the door to halt Ganados from entering the area for a limited time, and Leon doing kicks/suplexes when a Ganado is stunned.\n\nNow that it is released through Steam, the graphics have vastly improved compared to the version ten years before. The port is nice that the developers ACTUALLY retained certain tricks that can be used (e.g. The Ditman Glitch) for fun. The context-sensitive events are exactly retained for different situation and also for cutscenes, although I would have preferred the commands placed near each other, so that it would be more easier to counter things when it will be displayed in a split second.\n\nStoryline-wise, this version is just similar to the Resident Evil 4 games of past consoles. Even Ada's storyline has been included as well as some mini-games (Assignment Ada and The Mercenaries) have been included in the port.\n\nAll bonus items, drops from enemies, mini-bosses and bosses have been retained perfectly as it was in the previous console versions. Nothing changed of these events in the Steam version of this game. \n\nOverall, this port is superb, and what changed in this port are the enhanced graphics, the ability to play this game in Full HD, and many more!\n\nIf you are a Resident Evil fan and/or would like to relive the events that happened in an enhanced version, then this is definitely worth it. Also, there are Steam Trading Cards in this game, so that you can increase your Steam level, although I would not recommend buying in the Market because as of now, the cards are so expensive.",Recommended

"I have this on steam playing via a PC.  Maybe if it was 40 years ago, I was in college and if it came out right before doom.  Honestly I think the original doom was more fun.   It like operating a robot thats like one of the cars with a clicker control.  I'm trying to decide which is worse this or Alien Colonial Marines.  5 buck maybe if you got some time to kill.  Not impressed at all.  Like Alien this one only has a name that people like via the movies.  Even changing guns or healing is ridiculous.  Being rushed by 5 guys, unable to kill one with a full clip, take time to tab into your inventory, swap guns, heals yourself and presto your likely dead.  Dynamite income do not fear, just walk away and boom your dead.  Get hit, dont fear, your lack of control will likely get you killed before you can even find the guy again.   Like Aliens perhaps control understanding could help but something tells me with what I experienced.  Even if you know the control I have a feeling Aliens Colonial Marines would surpass this ones control limitations.  Maybe there a difference playing on a game console versus a PC.  Its so hard to believe with all the tech and other improvement over the last 40 years.  That games similar and knocking off the old stuff is hardly much better than the original.  I cant speak for game consoler perhaps it shines there but wow.",Not Recommended

"It's truly nice to play in 60 fps, the changes in textures are also a nice touch but many old textures remain as well as some bugs, however it's still the Resident Evil 4 we loved many years ago and I'm very satisfied. I only wanted to have a better videocard to play smoothly the 60 fps fixed promised as it seems to drop and causes slow motion when you use a lowe end video card.  After all Resident Evil 4 is one of the games that no matter how many times you have played, if you play again you're still gonna have fun.",Recommended
"Not to much to be said, it's one of the best games of all time and we finally have a decent PC port after years with a broken mess that needed modded to hell and back to even be playable. It's also nice that it can run at 60FPS instead being locked at 30 like all the previous releases of this title. It also includes all the additional content from the PS2 and Wii versions as well as the ""Easy Mode"" that wasn't available in the US release until now(unless you count the broken first attempt at a PC port)\n\nThe graphics aren't a massive step-up like with say, the HD version of MGS3 but it's still polished up a bit and looks great at a full 1080p. \n\nIf you've never played it, or want an excuse to play it again I highly reccomend picking this one up because it's fully worth the $20.",Recommended

"I am a little bit bias going into this review considering this is an all time favorite to me but I will try my best to be objective for the sake of it being ported to PC\n\n   So right off the bat I want to plainly say the game runs fine.  At least for me but everyone's PC is different so some have issues and others do not.  About the so called HD textures, well I hate to pop any bubbles of self gratification but there not impressive nor do they look like that big of an overhaul over the originals Gamecube graphics.   Yet if your like me you could give two poops about that crap because we just wanted to kick some butt!  Now does the game run at 60 FPS.  Yes and no,  I will explain my observation on the subject.  The overall experiece runs at a great 60 fps and looks great. I could feel the quick responsiveness of Leon with those lovely tank controls but...  Some things are naturally going to be buggy considering this bueatiful piece of art was made a long time ago.  Some of the reload Animations are finnicky,  definately the rifle reload.  Everytime I reload my rifle it looks like Leon's whole animation for his weapon and body slows down  but the game is still running at 60 fps. Its like the reload animation is 15 fps and the game is ahead of it,  Its hard to explain  and not game  breaking either just clunky looking.  You can notice little things out of place on enemies because the game was never truly meant to be ran at 60 fps.   Other then that though its fine.\n\n       Alright so lets get down to what you really want to know should ya buy or nay.  Here's what I say if you love the game and you already have it on a console then I would say nay. Personally I feel this is just for people who want it on PC or perhaps dont have their consoles anymore. Now if you always dreamed of your favorite console game coming to PC like me then a big hell yes for buying it!   Overall it plays great and its relatively cheap.    Like always though think for yourself and draw your own conclusions and have a good day!",Recommended

"I've played Resident Evil 4 on the Nintendo Gamecube, Playstation 2, 3, and now on the PC. \n\nThe story is following Secret Service Agent Leon Scott Kennedy one of the few survivors of the viral outbreak in Raccoon City from Resident Evil 2, on a mission to save the President’s Daughter Ashley Graham. One doing so your mission becomes escape the cult group the Los Illuminados. They’re technically not zombies in this game they are infected with a parasite called Las Plagas.   \n\nThe Gameplay is as follows: you run along a path to a locked door, you then proceed  to have to find a key. Once you find said key the area will now flood with enemies. Rinse and repeat for about 11ish hours. It works and well it seems to be the Resident Evil thing to do. It does get kind of repetitive but later on.\n\nThe Graphics: They are pretty good maybe even great. But I did notice the game slowed down for me once entering the final area for a little bit but that was about it. The cutscenes look almost like the gameplay graphics. The graphics may look dated to some but it’s okay to me.\n\nThe Bad: Ammo can be scarce. Bosses can be a bit more challenging than most games. They added an Easy Mode for the main story.(What kind of weak ass shit is that?) Once you get Ashley you might as well have the game become one long ass escort mission. Not a lot of replayability once you obtain all the good items. \n\nOverall/Final Score: This game is overall really good I recomend it but the bad aspects might turn off some gamers from this great game definitely worth 20$ or even wait for it to get it on sale. I give it a 8.4/10 some flaws but overall a good game.",Recommended
"10/10 nine years is a long time to wait for a proper port, even for a game as celebrated as Resident Evil 4. Its release on the GameCube in 2005 ushered in a new era for the franchise, as well as a different perspective and play style that its sequels quickly inherited. Capcom capitalized on its immense success, porting the game to multiple platforms, and the game was graciously welcomed by the succeeding console generation on the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. Though nine years is indeed a lot of time for a second PC port, there is a reason it may be warranted. Resident Evil 4 has been available on the PC since 2007, but its release was less than stellar compared to its console brethren. The horror it unleashed was more on a technical level, given the lack of mouse controls and the option to adjust visual settings. Dubbed Resident Evil 4 Ultimate HD Edition, the game has returned in an attempt to set past wrongs right. The game has received substantial upgrades, and may be the best version yet released, even if ""ultimate"" might not be the right word.",Recommended

After playing as Hunk in this mode, I remained hungry for more as both RE5 and RE6 were released. Sadly even though he showed up in RE6, that signature neck snap wasn't to be found. To this day I reserve hope that RE7 will bring back Hunk and his spin-around neck snap.",Recommended

"One of the greatest video games ever made finally gets a (good) PC port.\n\nAt its core, RE4 is a TPS with an over-the-shoulder view, and usually regarded as the game to introduce and popularize that camera setup. It mostly eschews the old horror trappings of the Resident Evil series for a more uptempo, ""action thriller"" pace, while nonetheless maintaining constant situational tension and classic ""survival"" mechanics such as a fleshed out inventory system and game-long resource and ammunition micromanagement. Spatial awareness and thinking on your feet are highly rewarded, and while deft aiming and accurate shooting can extricate you from sticky situations, you're bound to pay a dear price for being overaggressive or mindless of your approach. Tackling a room in a gung-ho, reactive, ""autopilot"" manner is sure to put even experienced players in some hot water. RE4 is the first mainline RE to be envisioned as a shooter, but it nonetheless still retains a large focus on finesse of movement, which is absolutely required for close-quarters combat and evasion. Melee finishers (usually prompted by the player's shooting of a specific spot of the enemy, such as the head or knee), and the myriad setups this shooting + finisher interplay can uncover present inventive players with endless combat opportunities. Two given RE4 playthroughs can and will vary wildly, and this is a game which will require multiple playthroughs to truly appreciate, understand and master.\n\nHighly challenging, packed with tons of content (the Mercenaries unlockable minigame is, in itself, nearly as addictive and compelling as the main game), secrets and esoteric techniques to be learned, RE4 is one of the finest action games ever made - a work of sheer genius whose excellence is, for my money, yet to be surpassed in the TPS genre.",Recommended
"This was the one Resident Evil game that changed the direction of the franchise (for better and for worse). It's STILL one of my favorite games. I played the Game Cube version, the Wii version, the HD version on 360, and now this. My only gripe is that Capcom is the King of bogus DLC or on-disc content that people would have to pay to unlock. Capcom was one of the publishers that started re-re-re-re-releasing versions of their cash cow hits and just adding more textures and re-presenting it as ""HD"". \n\nPros: This game is locked at 60fps and it's so much more of a smoother experience than back in the day when the fps was choppy with a lot of blur added to make up for the low res graphic settings (there are now high settings available)\n\nCons: Even using Nvidia's adaptive sync with a 144hz monitor doesn't seem to make this game immune to occassional tearing.

"I've played through this game over 10 times, most of them being on the Wii version, and I have to say, this is a really good port, especially compared to the older one. The game runs fairly consistently at 60 or 30 FPS, but some of the quick time events are near impossible when the game is running at 60FPS for some reason. Mouse and keyboard controls take getting used to, but once you're used to them, aiming is a lot quicker and more precise. The game itself is fantastic. The pacing is perfect, the atmospheres are spooky, and you're given just enough ammo to get by, which forces you to think carefully during enemy encounters. The main story is very long, and fantastic. There are 2 bonus stories which are great, but not as long and a little repetitive, and then there's the Mercenaries mode, which is an absolute blast. A must have if you love RE4, and a great entry point to the series as well, just be wary of running it at 60FPS due ot the awful QTEs.",Recommended

"I am gonna do a simple pros and cons review for this legendary game.\n\nPros:-\n1. Gunplay which is extremely responsive and precise. You can even go to new game plus runs where you carry over your old weapons .While this makes the game easy yet it is satisfying to kill that boss which gave you so much trouble previously.\n2. Movement schemes which to some may seem hindering yet the pacing of the enemies make it viable.\n3. Separate ways and Assignment ada which are both excellent and show the story from a different perspective.\n4. The mercenaries. This is truly an amazing mode for RE4. You get to play as Leon,Ada,Hunk,Krauser and Wesker in 5 challenge maps. These give a new flavour to the gameplay and playing as Hunk ,Wesker or Krauser is extremely enjoyable.\n5.Boss fights. Some of the boss fights in this game are truly epic. The bosses are well balanced and can be taken down by simple handgun or a single shot rocket launcher .\n6. Weapons. No weapon is bad. The puny handgun you get at the beginning can help you till the end of the game. Even weapons which aren't considered good like mine thrower can be used effectively.\n7. This game isn't newbie friendly. You will have to give time and even then you will die alot. You'll have to give it time and learn to play.\n\nCons:-\n1. Quick time events and button mash events are never a good thing.\n2. The Story is nice but the appearence of Ada as the mysterious lady and the age old cliched dialogues are not sweet on my ears.\n3. The performance can be a mixed bag for many. The graphics aren't that great and the 30/60fps cap occasionally slows down the game.\n\nOverall i'd say it is an amazing game although this port and the previous one leaves a lot to be desired in terms of performance.",Recommended
"This is really the last good Resident Evil game before they glitzed the series up with massive explosions, crappy story line and garbage game mechanics. \n\nBuy it and relive the end of an era when developers put out quality survival horror zombie goodness. \nThe graphics have been tweaked nicely and the game runs as smooth as it used to on the ps2.",Recommended

"I've played Resident Evil 4 for the Ps2 and the early PC edition, recently purchased this most recent edition and loved every second of it. I did however have a couple problems that should be noted. First off, the mouse movement was a little difficult to get used to it felt delayed and slow to me. Second, whenever I hit intense moments in the game the sound would cut in and out repeatedly until I left to a new area. After searching, I didn't find any fix for it, I don't know if anyone else has had this issue but I felt like I should note it. As far as how improved the game is from its earlier versions, the textures are noticably polished, the game will look better, however, I was not THAT impressed with how much better it looked, but it is noticable. Other than that, I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking to relive that bit of nostalgia, or for the newcomer to the series!",Recommended
"This game rocked my fourteen-year-old-world so hard that I probably played it close to five times in a row when I got it.  Then after Resident Evil got kinda meh and every game copied RE4's QTEs and set pieces, I guess I kind of thought that I just liked it at the time and it wasn't that good...then I bought the Steam version, and nope, this game with better textures is one of the best games available right now.  There's really something to be said for a game that plays out the same way every time, but constantly gives you this feeling like you're in total control of what Leon does.  It's just beautiful.  So detailed.  It's hard to imagine a world where this isn't one of the games I mentally compare every game I play to.  I'd buy it at a high price, but thankfully, you don't have to anymore, stranger.",Recommended

I have played this game when it was released in 2005 and it is still a great game. Old school mechanic suits well to it. HD graphics is just the icing on the cake. Despite some frustrating moments I love it.\n\nWhat I don't love (actually hate) are the QT events. It seems sometimes the key press is not registered which leads to your death and you have to play the part again. I don't know if its just custom key mapping problem or not but I do not care - In my opinion it just have to work.,Recommended
"The game looks great and plays very well. Comes with all the bonus content the rereleases added. Great purchase for it's price. The game holds up well as a classic and immensely fun. Will probably revisit very soon.\n\nOnly problem I have with this game is that some cutscenes look like they were pulled straight from the Gamecube or PS2 version. There are a few of the crap quality cutscenes in the middle portion of the main story, all of the side story's cutscenes, and the additional videos. They're especially apparent when playing on a high resolution screen.\n\nNote: I played only on an Xbox 360 Controller, not on a keyboard.",Recommended
"Before reading this understand - I played through my Gamecube version over 20 times and the Wii Version twice. I KNOW THIS LIKE THE BACK OF MY HAND. I'm mainly putting some quick thoughts down for those who haven't played it or played an older version.\n\nOk, obviously the games good. Worth the cost if you haven't played it or want to go through again. It still holds up fantastically, The PC version has all the extras from the GC and PS2 editions which is a nice little plus. Keyboard and mouse controls are kinda gross, and Quicktime events can screw you over on an xbox controller because there is a glitch where it shows the keys to press instead of the controller buttons.\n\nThis is the pinnacle of the Resident Evil Series - creepy but not too scary, controls great (with a controller at least), hard but not impossible, and chock full of little secrets. A few too many QTE's but most of them aren't troubling. If for some reason you don't have a copy of this game, you need to get it. It's worth every single cent. For some reason I had a little more trouble noticing items on the PC version but that may be an issue with my monitor. I cannot find any outstanding issues with the port over to PC.\n\nThe story is great, every part is memorable and noteworthy and you can feel the meticulous planning and love that went into every detail of the game. You don't need a super strong PC to run it smoothly so unless you're running an ancient rig or still have an other version to play GET THIS VERSION AND PLAY THROUGH IT ALREADY.",Recommended

"One of the best Third-Person Shooters I've ever played.\n\nTake the role of Leon S. Kennedy from Resident Evil 2 as you search for the President's Daughter. \n\nUnlike earlier Resident Evil games, 4 was the first one to adopt a Third Person perspective. Unlike 5 and the later games however, it plays like the originals.\n\nYou have limited inventory space, but you don't deal with it in real time. Unlike 5, you have an Attache Case that can hold limited items, but you can move and switch the items in the case to take full effect of it.  You must guard Ashely, but she doesn't have an inventory and her AI isn't atrocious.\n\nWhile more action focused, the game is still quite scary, and it's atmosphere is pretty amazing, if slightly bland at times. The only real drawback to the game is it's color pallette, but the Steam version has 4 color filters you can play with, if you want to.\n\nThe original PC version of Resident Evil 4 was a goddamned nightmare. No mouse aiming (you had to aim with the GODDAMNED KEYPAD), holding space to run, and all sorts of fucked controls. The Steam release is a port of the PS3/360 version, which in itself is a port of the Wii version. Since the classic Resident Evils aren't on Steam (RE:REmake is almost here!), this is the best Resident Evil game on Steam. 5 is 4, except watered down, and 6 is just god awful.

"In my honest opinion, this is the best game ever made. My favorite game of all time! To begin with, the story is just brilliant and it really draws you deep into the game, eager to know what's going to happen next. The game is extremely tense, especially when you are in the middle of facing a boss. As you are playing, your heart beats and your hands begin to shake due to the intensity which really makes it fun to play. Admittedly, this game is actually pretty scary due to the eerie music, and creepy atmosphere. This game doesn't rely on cheap jump scares like a lot of today's games. The gameplay is excellent and it is set out in a unique style although if you are used to modern day 3rd person shooters, you might find the controls to be a little awkward but you will get used to it after about an hour. I definitely recommend getting this game. It is a MUST have. 10/10.",Recommended

"Horrendous use of quicktime events in this game. Too often, youi'll find yourself relieved at finishing a particular gameplay sequence, or boss fight section, and then instantly get instakilled by a QTE. \nThe first half of the game was pretty mediocre and didn't feel much like a Resident Evil game. All those cloak-wearing non-zombies were really putting me off the game. Thankfully, the 2nd half the game picked up and did away with those cultists (for the most part). If QTEs didn't exist in this game, I would agree with all those bandwagoning review sites that this game is great and worthy of all its ports and remakes. Unfortunately, that isn't the case...\nAnyway, there are plenty of weapons, along with the ability to purchase upgrades for them. Collectibles are worth finding, since you can combine some of them and sell them to purchsae your weapon upgrades. Boss fights are pretty neat (except for the one in the Ada mission since it's riddled with QTEs), and storytelling was done well.\n\nTLDR: If you never played this game before, you should probably play the Wii version (I assume QTEs are esier to deal with on Wii).",Recommended
"Resident Evil 4 Ultimate HD Edition (PC Port Review)\n\nFINALLY!!! Capcom is giving appropriate attention to giving the PC heads a proper HD port!!!

No frame loss through out.\nInput: They nailed the K/M controls. X360 controls are the same as they were on consoles, I personally have forgotten my controller completely when playing on K/M. However, if you plan on playing with K/M unplug any other controllers as the input detection seems glitchy.\n\nGood/Bad? \nOkay, I'm a little biased here because Resident Evil 4 is my absolute favorite game of all time. But, this is an OK port. The game itself is still all there in all it's glory, but the small performance issues I've read up on, and the glitching controls for when you try and use K/M when controllers are plugged in is a bit disheartening that Capcom got lazy with it. Worth the purchase if you loved the Resident Evil series, and if you don't have a console and have yet to experience this amazing game? This is a great way to see what transpires in rural Europe with Leon.\n\nGame: 4.5/5\nPort: 3/5",Recommended
"The first (and probably the best) of the ""new"" generation of Resident Evil games and the last one to actually be ""survival-horror"" as far as I'm concerned (and it still doesn't feel quite as frightening as the original trilogy). Still, the series needed a breath of fresh air around when it was released and it updates the combat mechanics of the game while not making it too much like any other shooter game with monsters. It usually pulls off feeling challenging but fair, although there are a few cheap parts where you are almost guaranteed to mess up at least once.\n\nThe story remains captivating throught the game and serves its purpose of keeping the player engaged although there are a few instances of ""cutscene stupidity"" (mostly involving a certain girl getting captured...multiple times...).\n\nThere's also a fair bit a latitute as far as weapons go once you get futher into the game, with a variety of pistols, shotguns, rifles and some more specialized weapons you can choose from to suit your playstyle. Each of them has certain strengths and weaknesses that can be exploited.\n\nAs always, the music stays Recommended to the series standard of setting the mode of each area, becoming mysterious, nervous and frantic at the appropriate times (and of course, some of the most disturbing segments are when it ceases playing entirely).\n\nMy biggest compaint is probably the overuse of quicktime events both within and outside of cutscenes. This is a personal pet peeve of mine, and I think they often mar some otherwise great games. Sometimes this is tastefully employed in RE 4; however, there is one particular scene late in the game that reveals important information concerning the plot which is basically one continous quicktime event. Suffice to say, if you keep dying during the same scene it gets old fast. It's pretty safe to say that if you enter a cutscene, you need to be ready to hit buttons "" just in case.""\n\nUltimately, RE 4 is a great game, even if it doesn't follow exactly in the spirit of the earlier titles (although argubably, with 5 and 6 out now that spirit is now irrevocably changed anyway). For instance, you didn't feel like an complte badass like Leon S. Kennedy apparently is with his acrobatics and roundhouse kicks:  each and every foe could mean death in 1-3, while this is only a concern with largish groups of the common mooks in 4. This totally changed the dynamic of the game, and yet 4 somehow still makes it work enough to not completely drain the game of suspense. Five and six are not nearly as successful in this, unfortunately.\n\nIn my mind, I tend to think of 4 as a worthy game that stands on its own and not relate it overly much to the originals except for certain minor plot and references that, honestly, aren't even neccearry and wouldn't even effect the value of the game that much if they weren't there if you think about it (other than to retain the title ""Resident Evil""). For what it is, I enjoy it as one of my favorite all-time action-adventures/horror games (9 out of 10).",Recommended
"[h1] Genre-defining Genius [/h1]\n\n[i]Resident Evil 4[/i] is [b]the[/b] third-person shooter, a title that both polarized fans of the Resident Evil franchise and simultaneously inspired dozens of games with its satisfying gunplay, emphasis on action, and tongue-in-cheek storytelling. The president's daughter has been kidnapped by a mysterious cult, and it is up to Leon Kennedy (protagonist of [i]Resident Evil 2[/i]) to save her. Upon investigating a rural village in Spain, Leon must battle through hostile villagers, deranged cultists, and strange creatures all infested with a mind-controlling parasite in order to uncover the truth behind the cult, rescue the president's daughter, and make it out the country alive.\n\nStory-wise, there isn't much else to say. Compared to earlier entries in the Resident Evil series, there's a strange self-awareness and sense of humor that remains constant throughout the entire adventure. Leon has turned from a scared, serious police rookie into a stereotypical action movie star, and Leon's reactions to the various scenarios he encounters cements this. The schlocky one-liners he spouts out when he's able to are downright hysterical and memorable at times. With this in mind, more emphasis has been placed on the gameplay itself, which is a radical departure to the traditional survival-horror the series is known for. The game is broken up into chapters, which are then broken up into segments, divided into smaller maps that vary in length and size. As you play, you will be fighting enemies, avoiding traps, looking for treasures, collecting ammunition and cash, and occasionally solving puzzles as you venture between three distinct locations: rural villages, ancient castles, and a modern military base. \n\n[i]Resident Evil 4[/i] controls a little differently than contemporary third-person shooters. The camera will always face forward, as Leon is restricted to tank-like movement - meaning he can only move forward, backward, and turn either left or right. Leon will aim with the press of a button, with a slight weapon-sway that requires constant attention. Aiming also locks Leon into place, requiring you to position yourself carefully in order to keep yourself safe. Leon also has access to the knife, a low-damage melee weapon that is activated separately that behaves in the same way. Combat is based heavily on aiming for specific points on an enemy, whether it be the head or legs, to stun them. After an enemy is stunned, if Leon is close enough, you can perform a highly damaging melee takedown attack that saves ammunition as well as potentially damaging other nearby enemies. With this in mind, targeting certain limbs becomes a viable strategy for crowd fights: if an enemy is wielding a thrown weapon, you can potentially disarm him by shooting his hand; if an enemy is wearing a helmet, bringing him to his knees will present an opportunity for a melee attack; if there's a crowd, knocking them back or tripping them up will slow them down. \n\nInventory management makes a return from the earlier Resident Evil games, presented in an updated format - your backpack is divided into a grid, with every item in your inventory (ammo, health items, grenades, weapons) taking up spaces on said grid. Balancing your inventory capacity with what is necessary and preventing item hoarding provides for a consistently tense and challenging experience. You may upgrade your inventory space, as well as acquiring weapons and upgrades, by purchasing them from the Merchant, a mysterious robed figure that only seeks to aid Leon in his mission. You can gather cash for upgrades by defeating enemies, locating treasures through exploration, and even potentially combining treasures to increase their value.\n\nThe port itself runs well enough, at least with the base campaign. No crashes, no major frame drops, nothing distracting. Aside from the base campaign, there are several optional modes for fun and unlockables - Assignment Ada and Seperate Ways both star Ada Wong, a reocurring character in the Resident Evil series, as she participates in a non-canon military mission and aids Leon through his journey, respectively. While I have not played the former, the latter is plagued with performance issues and crashing for some mysterious reason, and has not recieved the same HD treatment that the base game has. There is also the famous Mercenaries mode, a timed arcade-style arena mode where you're tasked to rack up as many points as possible through killing enemies in a stylish fashion. \n\n[i]Resident Evil 4[/i] is arguably the most successful and famous entry in the entire Resident Evil series, and it shows - being largely seperated from the main series' story, featuring plenty of action and satisfying gunplay, as well as memorable encounters and set-pieces, this title stands as a milestone in the history of games, and will hopefully continue to inspire titles in the future. I recommend this title for anyone looking for a challenging shooter, an action game with horror elements, or just as a continuation of the prolific series.",Recommended

"Gamecube/PS2 era classic game. A pioneer of the 3dr person shooter, really. One of the 1st games I remember to use the over the shoulder shooting mechanic available now in all 3rd person games. Also, a very QTE heavy game. This game and God of War being one of the earliest examples of  heavy QTE I remember. Which I hope is something that will die off soon. That said. Great port, complete with tank controls and all, but response. Mouse/ keyboard works well here. Mouse aiming gives you a nice edge unavailable in console versions of this game. Xbox pad is implemented well with the right button prompts. Pick it up for under $10 to see one of the earliest and best 3rd person shooters.",Recommended

"So this is the Resident Evil that changed the game. It's pretty much exactly as I remember it on the Gamecube, with the addition of the PS2 version's added features and the bonus of HD graphics of the 2014 PC (with the old textures still available if you don't care for HD).\n\nI feel like there are some issues with the game due to stepping back from Resident Evil 5, mostly related to moving around in the game world, aiming guns, and melee attacks, but these are trivial and not directly related to the port. The greatest downside is that the game is highly unoptimized and runs worse than Resident Evil 5, and don't even bother playing at 60 FPS unless your computer is powerful enough to divide by zero.\n\nThere seems to have also been some rebalancing to compensate for the ease of the mouse and keyboard. It's been too many years since I played the Gamecube version, but I don't remember the game having such a small window for error. I went through the game with 80% accuracy or higher, and for most of it, I was stressing for ammo!\n\nTo summarize, this is a great example of a good game, but bad port. It certainly set a new standard for the series (even if its tricks are highly outdated, especially the cumbersome inventory system) and inspired other third person horror games like Dead Space, but if your computer is two grades above a toaster , might just want to pass this one up for now.",Recommended

"The HD revamp did improve the graphics, but it's kind of choppy on higher settings regardless of your rig or setup. There's not much to say about this.\nAs for the game itself, RE4 is a classic. This game keeps you on your toes, and there's plenty of other objectives to complete other than the main campaign. Mercenaries is just a wave-based survival mode, but this mode alone is enough to keep you entertained for hours.\nThe worse aspects include the story and dialog, which is cheesy as a typical action movie. Leon is the hammiest character I've ever seen in a video game.  Resident Evil's notoriously stiff controls take some getting used to, but it's really the only way to play this game. For a game that's almost ten years old, there's not much to expect, especially since there's numerous sequels that have had their share of aging. \n",Recommended
[*]The HD textures are hardly any different from previous versions\n[*]Using the 60 FPS apparently needs a really powerful computer or else the game will slow down\n[*]Keyboard & mouse controls worked nicely for me (even the keys for the QTEs are more appropriately placed as opposed to the previous PC version)\n\n[b]Same 'ol RE4 (that isn't the GameCube one) but at least better than the previous PC version of RE4[/b]\n\n\n\n\nAlso the Wii Edition is still the best version.,Recommended

Garbage.\nI played the game for the first time here on pc and i was really dissapointed in what i saw.\nThe controls are fine and aiming with a mouse is much easier than with a controller, but the main problem is in the graphix.\nI had to play the game windowed, with shit resolution, because otherwise it would lag so much it would have been impossible to play, and my computer is not even that bad.\nSo, in the end, i recommend playing this game on the gamecube if you can, since this port is even worse than the dark souls one, or hell, even deadly premonition's.",Not Recommended
"The most impressive thing about RE4, and what the sequels so miserably failed to recreate, was the progression of designed enemy encounters as you go through the game. In many action games before and after RE4, the developers seem to be struggling to find a gameplay loop that is fun for the player. If ""something fun"" is found, the instinct is to repeat the success over the entire game. Many successful action games are designed like this, and the best ones manage to use graphics, story, and positive feedback mechanisms such as collectibles to mask the repetition for the player. Another common strategy to mask repetition is to mix up the successful gameplay loop with scripted sequences that give the impression that gameplay is changing, when you are actually just pressing buttons to progress through interactive cutscenes.\n\nOn the other end of the spectrum, you have a few game series that are not designed with the described ""repeat success"" mindset. A particularly rare philosophy is when a developer sees a successful gameplay loop as a starting point, and tries to introduce new successful loops through an entire game. The ""moment of fun"" is explored and investigated from every interesting angle, but after that it is time to move on to the next thing. The problem is, developing games according to this philosophy requires really talented people, lots of time and huge piles of money. Nintendo is the the only reliable producer of these type of games, with the 3d Mario series and the Legend of Zelda games.\n\nAnd that brings us to RE4. RE4 was developed with exactly the type of mindset that makes the Mario and Zelda games so unique. It was a revelation to play a third person shooter, or for that matter any type of shooting game, that explored enemy encounters to their fullest potential, but then briskly moved on to the next thing. There was no ""trickery"" to give a fake sense of gameplay progression. There were no ""reskinned"" levels with the same challenges. There was no overabundance of scripted sequences. There was no reliance on story to motivate the player to go through boring gameplay. \n\nInstead of this, the game had a string of perfectly tuned enemy encounters, where almost every one brought something new to the table. However, RE4 did not just provide variation from one encounter to the next, but it also unified the encounters with a strong sense of progression, which it arguably did even better than the aforementioned Nintendo games. The increased player agency from finding weapons, pesos and buying upgrades were almost perfectly tuned against the challenge level in RE4, which made it so depressing to play RE5 (or RE6) where they just didn't care due to the impossibility of balancing coop anyway.",Recommended

Well thats Recommended, but some are still low res so the game is now really uneven in his pixel ratio.\nThe fact thats its HD doesn't help on the whole look of the game... the gamecube and wii version looked a lot better because the tv added some smudginess and grain, making everything more creepy and real.\nNot the best port i played, if you can stick with the old console version don't buy it, otherwise don't hesitate.",Recommended
"If you like action games you'll love this and personally having played all Resident Evil games I think this is the best one in the series. It goes from zombies caused by the T-Virus to Plaga which is a species of parasite that basically makes its host a lot stronger and resistant to pain to put it shortly. In chapter one to kill an enemy quickly just put a bullet to the head, job done but from chapter 2 onwards it's not so easy, you head shoot your foes the parasite pops out and it can kill you very quickly so you have to keep moving, oh yeah and don't forget the chainsaw wielding enemies too because they can kill you instantly.\n\nTo some the only downside to this game is that it seemed to stray from the Recommended Horror Survival so to speak to being solely an action game and nothing more but i disagree. You still have to conserve ammo when engaging your enemies, you have to make every shot count which is what a horror survival is all about and that's what you have here.\n\nBottom line: this game is brilliant and no doubt you will get a lot of enjoyment out of it, highly recommended.",Recommended

"Resident Evil 4 (Also known as Biohazard 4 in Japan), is a third-person shooter/survival horror video game developed by Capcom Productions in 2005. It's a departure in the long running series and is considered to be a forerunner in the third-person shooter genre, making many enhancements to the established gameplay that have later become a standard.\nThe game was released with a massively positive reception, winning multiple game of the year awards from different publicizations around the globe.\n\nWhen it comes to gameplay, RE4 takes the clunky controls from the original games and throws them into garbage bin. The camera is set up behind the main character and you can aim in full 3D, you can't however move while you're aiming. A brilliant idea from the developers, since this combined with the rather difficult aiming mechanic makes up for some truly terrifying situations where you have to aim precisely on the different pressure points the enemies have. You can pop their heads off, shoot them in the legs to make them fall and preserve ammunition by stabbing them, among various other things like explosives and disabling them by shooting their hands to remove their weaponry.\n\nRegardless, RE4 is a lot more action packed than the previous iterations in the series and therefore isn't as chilling. This, however, is compensated by some truly amazing set pieces and some of the best pacing you will EVER see in a video game. You will never have a dull moment playing this game, and if you already haven't, you should.\n\nSo is there really something you can criticize about this game? Certainly! It doesn't have a memorable soundtrack, most of it is ambient which does fit the moody atmosphere quite well but isn't something i'd personally listen to while i go jogging in the morning. Speaking about atmosphere, the game does something unexpected a little bit after the halfway of the game. And, without spoiling anything goes absolutely INSANE.\nThis however, is not an issue if you dont mind campy stuff. But will be a big problem to people who were enjoying the extremely serious and atmospheric nature of the game for the first 12 hours.\n\n[Spoiler]Giant spanish robot midget Napoleon, what the fuck Capcom!?:D[/Spoiler]\n\nIn the end, even 9 years after the release, this is a game YOU whoever you are should be playing. It's a horror/action classic that will never be forgotten and will be admired and imitated for years to come.\n\nPS. Since this is a review of the Ultimate HD Edition, i should note that the port is fine. But you shouldn't even consider getting this unless you have an X360 Controller for PC. The mouse and keyboard controls are absolutely awful.",Recommended

At times they're completely fine, and other times they're just really frustrating. For example, in the middle of a dialogue movie you'll need to press two buttons or just die on the spot... sometimes my hand isn't even on the keyboard as I'm watching the video... and I have to take a death and do it over. Another time I was finishing a ~5 minute event and it was followed by not one, but two events that I failed consecutively to my death.

The console versions may be easier to handle but you will learn how to play the game with your mouse and keyboard pretty fast until you won't notice that the controls bothered you at first. \n\nThe graphics are quite well considering how old the game is, even though i didn't notice the changes of the HD remake all to much. \n\nSo if you like zombies, horror and some action then this game might be just perfect for you.",Recommended

"I've beaten this game numerous times on PS2 and so far, from what I've experienced, the HD version of RE 4 on PC is a nostalgic trip down memory lane.  The textures have been sharpened nicely, the lighting effects are pretty, and the water reflections are more noticeable.  \n\nAs a diehard RE fan, I believe 4 was the last amazing installment in the entire series considering it was at this point where the games core mechanics drastically changed, ie, third person, elimination of top-down camera angles that only altered upon entering different rooms (which I miss desperately because they increased the sense of fear and suspense throughout  playing, even though there were critics who believed this point of view made controls more difficult), combat moves such as kicking Ganados when they're stunned, weapon upgrades, collecting relics worth money TO upgrade/modify/buy weapons, inventory size, etc; the list goes on and on.  Ultimately, though, RE 4 is an excellent game that introduced a plethora of features never before seen or utilized in the series prior to this installment.  It was a fantastic game on the Gamecube, PS2 and yes, it's even better for the PC when you take into the consideration that, if your PC can handle it, the 60 fps makes an enormous difference in your gameplay. \n\nMy only con with the game so far is the mouse and keyboard controls.  I realize this is just preference and can be fixed by using a 360 controller, which I intend on doing, but overall these controls are difficult to adjust to at first.  \n\nOther than that, what are you waiting for?

"This is the game that killed, yet strangely saved the resident evil franchise. If this game hadn't been as successful as it was it's possible the franchise wouldn't still be here today. What I mean by ""killed the franchise"" is that it made a drastic change from the first three games by putting itself in a more action oriented enviorment, leading the franchise to pop out many terrible games with very few good ones recently. Speaking of action it makes the game much scarier than its predecessors in my opinion. You have a scarce supply ammunition, enemies which act as bullet sponges, and a combat knife. The damage is distributed similairly so to how it is done in the Dark Souls series, enemies deal massive damage with slow attacks. When all of these elements are used in tandom you are forced to rely on your own wit to outsmart, outmanevour, and defeat your enemies. The gameplay is really fun while being pretty scary, its definitely one of the high points of the game. When it comes to the story what are you expecting? It's a resident evil game, while I wouldnt say the plot is predictable you should have an idea of what to expect, if that makes any sense. The game also has a series of unlockables for when you beat the game in different scenarios adding a lot of replay value. Most notable of the unlockables is the mini-game ""Mercenaries"" where you fight hordes of enemies with predetermined weapons in 1 of 4 stages. It can definitely keep you occupied after the main campaign. In the end this game is easy to reccomend at only $20, I can say with confidence that the game is an easy 9.7/10.",Recommended

"I've been out of the Resident Evil franchise since 1999, got tired of it after 3 games.\n\nThe 2014 Capcom Steam Sales rolls in and I see Resident Evil 4 HD is on special.\nDecided then to buy the entire series and resume where I left off.\n\nAfter playing with it for 38 hours, I. Love. This game. It gives you enough of a 'oh crap, I'm out of ammo! What am I going to do!' before it throws very little ammo at you - just enough to barely survive.\n\nConsider me back into the Resident Evil fold. Can't stress enough just how good and worthwhile playing Resident Evil 4 is.\n\nAlso, be sure to check out the Resident Evil 4 HD Texture upgrade project http://www.re4hd.com/ its doing quite a great job of FULLY updating all the textures (not some, which is what Capcom did. HD textures and SD textures being displayed side-by-side) to HD.\n\nAt the time of writing, the project only released a first public test release of the Village stage. Based on that, it is a massive step up from what Capcom has provided.",Recommended
"Brilliant game, not only played this on the Wii, PlayStation 2 and Xbox 360, I just had to buy it on this. The graphics aren't really 'Ultimate HD' they are just regular, and the controls take a while to get used to but it's well worth the money! 10/10",Recommended
"All time favorite game right here. Probably always will be. Got it for the ps3, gamecube, and finally PC as well. Out of all the Resident Evil games created this is by far the best. Mercinaries never gets old :)",Recommended
"One thing to get out of the way, if you do decide to buy this game, I highly recommend using an XBOX controller. It will make your life so much easier.\n\nPro - The character models for the most part look very nice. Capcom has updated the models to make them sharper, crispier, and added new textures.\n- The framerate is now in 60FPS\n-Has all the extra from the re-releases of the game\n-Great texture mods are available (or will be)\n-Same great gameplay from 2005\n-1080p\n\nCon - Motion blur is beyond terrible,I highly recommend that you turn it off ASAP.\n-Only about 10% of the game has HD textures, the other 90% are old textures with a filter over it (2xSAL)\n-No new extras\n-You can't aim and walk (not an issue for me but might annoy you)\n-Tank controls (not an issue for me)\n-Might not run great on certain computers (runs fine on mine, GTX 880M, i7-4810MQ 2.8Ghz)\n\n\nVerdict\n-Overall, this is a great version of Resident Evil 4. I don't think Capcom has a reason to release this game again unless they are doing a full ""HD"" version (100% updated graphics, lighting, updated controls, ect..), but I am sure this will be the ""final"" version.\n-If you love RE4 or have never played it, then I highly suggest buying this game. This is one of the greatest video games of all time. It revolutionized the 3rd person shooter. \n- I am pretty disappointed at the ""HD"" in the title (it is a little misleading), but this is the ""definite"" version of RE4.",Recommended

"Note: This is my first review of a game on steam (this is also aimed towards people who have never played this game). I hope you find it useful as to whether or not to purchase this game!\n\nI should probably make it clear that this is the only version of the game I have played. I have had no experience with any other versions, and one of the first games I purchased after finishing my new build. I was at first a bit skeptical about buying Resident Evil 4. It didn't seem like the type of game I would be interested in. It's old, cheesy (as I found out as I played), and referred to as the game which killed the series. Because of this, I never really considered to play it. I thought it would be a waste of time, money, and an overall dissapointment.\n\nI was wrong. I was so extremely wrong.\n\nTo be honest, I don't really know why I even bought this masterpiece. I never do spend much, so it felt strange purchasing this. (Actually, it was the drought of 2014 which probably did it! And don't worry, Shadow of Mordor, you're an exception!) Anyway, I jumped right into the game right after it finished downloading. At first, It felt really strange. The controls felt awkward, even with the use of my Xbox 360 controller. Only a few minutes in, and I was thrown into the action. I felt vulnerable and angry that the camera never really seemed to do what I wanted it to. After dying several times by means of an axe to the face, a pitchfork from behind, and of course, those God forsaken bear traps, I finally made it to this quaint village in ""rural europe"" which totally in no way seems familiar to Spain on any degree whatsoever, only to meet dozens of infected villagers and chainsaw guy. From that moment on, I absolutely fell in love. \n\nEvery shot, suplex, ridiculous one liner, and plagas made me love it more and more. So much that I completed it again, and again, and again, and some more. Sure, It doesn't have the graphical fidelity of modern games today, or an amazing story to go along with it. But my God, it is FUN.\n\nWell, I guess this wasn't really a great review, or a review at all. Just a love letter to one of my favorite games of all time. I know I didn't cover all aspects of the game and how much it got right (pacing, for example), but by know I think you probably got an idea how I feel about Resident Evil 4. If you haven't bought this game by now, I strongly urge you to do so, and a Pro-Tip before I sign off:\n\nNever reload the Broken Butterfly, the Merchant has your back!!!",Recommended

However, I believe solely due to Mikami's influence and direction that they got the formula correct. They kept most gameplay mechanics similar (I.E. Scarce Ammo, Scarce Health, Limited Movement), while also increasing the amount of action the player encounters, re-invigorating the franchise with a new light and giving the player the choice to either evade or confront.\n\nRESIDENT EVIL 4:\n\nPlay as Leon Kennedy as he investigates a mysterious town lead by a sadistic cult. \nHis mission: To rescue the President's daughter, Ashley Graham.\n\nThe HD port is faithful to the original, while being the best version yet.

"The sound has been desyncing every time a metallic sound plays like the knights moving around. The game goes in to slow motion every time I close the inventory, even after turning aliasing off completely and lowering the details to medium or low. The game crashed on me after the 25 minute Kruaser/Helicopter part as I tried to enter the building leaving that area. Not worth the money, go buy this for 5 dollars at game stop on x-box 360 and call it a day. I know its not my PC because its brand new not even a month old. Built for gaming. The crash only happened the one time and I made it through the game so I will change to a recommend because its a great fun game, not really scary though. Also the sound problem may have been fixed by something I had to download for the voice acting to work on the evil within I'll find out next time I play through on pro I guess.

"Story: This game doesn't get enough credit for it's story. It's fun, highly-unrealistic, and action-packed. Characters are also unique and pretty awesome. \n\nSound: Music for this game is pretty good. It's slow at the non-action sections and then hypes up when the enemies start coming. Voice acting is fantastic. Though, one certain voice will haunt you forever.\n\nGameplay: So good. For those not use to it, the controls will feel odd and you WILL have trouble moving around and fighting at first. However, the controls are made to be this way. It helps give it that survival horror feel and requires the player to use more skill and such. You will get used to them in 20 minutes. And, even if you don't, all keys are rebindable. It also has support for the 360 controller, but I perfer the mouse and keyboard. So many brats will stop playing this game because the controls aren't your stereotypical 3rd person shooter. I'm glad they aren't. Or this game wouldn't be nearly as fun. The game has great variety of enemies as well as weapons. The game also hits the dot on challenging without being too hard or too easy, atleast on the normal difficulty. Proffesional will give you one hell of a  fight though. This is also one of the few games that gets escort missions RIGHT.\n\nReplayability: Way more then you'd expect. New costumes, new unlockable weapons, a new difficulty level, 3 EXTRA MODES. Also, the game is just fun to play again IN GENERAL. Also features New-Game plus-ish features.\n\nLast thoughts: As a fan of the Resident Evil series, I can safely say this is my favorite. I have no problem with the Resident Evil series changing from Survival-Horror to Action-Horror and so many people shit on this and Resident evil 5 (Also a good game) for the sake of NOT being survival horror. That's rediculouse. Go play SIlent Hill or Amnesia for horror. This game is great mixture of action and certain horror elements (Those regenerators...*shudders*) and is a fantastic game.

"Trying to review Resident Evil 4 in a modern video game environment is almost unfair in a way, as though it was hugely influence when it released, after so many years the mechanics and tone is pioneered have been replicated and refined so many times over that in comparison it’s hard for RE4 to really stack up. It’s not a bad game by any means, but playing it for the first time so long after release many elements come off as unpolished, clunky, unnecessary and occasionally incredibly frustrating. All the same if you manage to get past the many fumbles it makes, the experience at its core is still something rather incredible, with an amazing sense of place and some of the most satisfying combat you’re likely to find to this day.\n\nOpening with a brief history of the events leading up to RE4, we follow Leon Kennedy as he travels to a remote village in Spain on a mission to rescue the president’s kidnapped daughter. Upon arrival, he’s greeted with the welcoming screams of mutated cult worshipers and the roar of chainsaws, as the area around him quickly descends into murderous chaos that only grows stronger the closer he gets to whatever is awaking him at its core.\n\nTo say the plot in RE4 rapidly jumps around in tone would be a bit of an understatement, but instead of being to the degradation of its narrative (or often lack of one) it actually ends up working remarkably well at keeping the plot engaging and entertaining as it transitions from horror to action by the end. That’s not to say it's without its problems, as the oodles of plot holes, stereotypical characters (of which the female ones exist as little more than sex appeal and a way to squeeze in some ridiculous boob physics), and rarely explained backstory can attest, it manages a cheese ball charm that few games manage to pull off with such dramatic alterations taking place throughout the campaign and one of the reasons I think RE4 is so endearing in a lot of ways. It seems almost intentionally dumb, inviting you to laugh along with it and try not to read anything into it.\n\nRE4’s combat is easily its biggest asset, though also where the majority of its problems become such an annoyance, being at once an incredibly visceral, impactful, and brutal event where every bullet makes an impact, but also an awkward and consistently annoying undertaking do to the piss poor controls and horrendous menu system. It’s an incredible feeling to see a shot connect in RE4, to see the result of a bullet that you can’t afford to lose, as you scramble to take down hordes of resilient enemies often in cramped corridors with little in the way of cover. In the heat of the moment RE4 is brilliant, with the slow movement of enemies (which in any other game would be immensely dull, but here buy you crucial seconds to reload and relocate yourself) providing a combat experience I’ve never found in a game. It’s deliberate and intense despite its slower pace than many games, and makes each and every encounter satisfying and engaging, ramping up to some of the most impressive boss fights I’ve ever seen in a game (as well as a few of the worst).\n\nBut on the flip side there is everything that, perhaps a decade or so was easily overlooked for all that RE4 does right, but now becomes a glaring blight on the game that seeps into every area of the experience and makes it a lesser game than it could have been. Having to open the menu to switch weapons in the heat of battle is extremely jarring and annoying, pulling me out of the experience each and every time as I fumbled to select the weapon I wanted before closing the menu and trying to find my bearings again. \n\nDoubling up on this are is the constant wart on the Resident Evil series’s face: tank controls with button mappings that all but require you to entirely relearn how to play a third person shooter, and become a recurring issue that only worsens the longer you play as enemies become stronger. I eventually became acclimated to them, but there shouldn’t be a need for that. Having to spend hours trying to wrap my head around an unintuitive control scheme and make do with what limited mobility I’m given isn’t fun, and should never be a requirement for someone to play a game well.\n\nThe unlockable side missions that star your sexy, mysterious, but otherwise entirely nondescript blank slate of a companion, Ada, are the biggest testament to this. Taking double the damage of Leon, combat becomes an intensely frustrating affair where running away was often a more viable option than trying to fight enemies that you barely have time to turn around and shoot before they kill you in two hits. It’s also comprised almost entirely of abysmal mission objectives strewn throughout areas you’ve already played through, and ending with what could easily be two of the worst bosses I’ve ever encountered in a video game. Perhaps it’s unfair to pin these failings on the entire game, but in terms of content outside of the core campaign, the Ada missions are a huge missed opportunity and a horrible experience that no one should put themselves through. They add nothing, and you would be better forgetting they are even there.\n\nBut if I can look beyond my mountain of criticism at so many areas of the game, there is still so much that RE4 does that makes it a game worth playing, though far from the masterpiece it might have been so many years ago. The atmosphere, brilliant sense of place, and fantastic combat still create an experience that’s hard to pull yourself out of despite all its flaws, and often makes it easy to look past many of them because just those parts are so amazingly done. RE4 isn’t the best game I’ve ever played, and there are things about it that if I ever have to see in a game again it will be too soon, but I don’t regret my time with it and if you’ve also neglected it up until now there’s still definitely something great here to witness, though for how much longer I couldn’t say.\n\n[i][b]On the PC port:[/b][/i]\n[i]After the trainwreck that was the first RE4 PC version, it’s a welcome relief that Capcom has come out with something that’s not only playable, but possibly the best version of the game...in most regards. Despite improved KB/M controls, textures, and a higher frame rate, they failed both at optimizing the game for a large variety of hardware, and created new issues by tying the game speed to the frame rate. I experienced consistent slowdown on a machine that ought to be more than capable of running it, and as a result often had audio desync from cutscenes, occasional freeze ups, and a general lesser visual experience having to turn down most of the limited options just to get a stable frame rate (which even then seemed to fluctuate wildly for no apparent reasons). It’s a disappointment, but in many ways this is still a great version of the game provided you far exceed the recommended requirements, and happen to be lucky as the performance issues seem largely random with who they affect.[/i]",Recommended

"If I exclude old Resident Evil games, this is one of the best RE games IMHO. Only drownback is poorly M+K controls and 60fps optimisation.",Recommended
"A classic and still amazing survival action experience, but the PC port is almost barebones to a fault. It works and plays beautifully, even if the 60fps conversion makes some of Leon's animations look hilarious (Gotta QTE fast!). There are no audio options to speak of whatsoever, and surround mixing appears limited to 2 channels. This is still a game defined by its very distinct tank style controls. A gamepad is necessary because it feels right, and because mouse and keyboard does not (as in, it tries to mimic the gamepad through acceleration and it just feels off). Texture work is cleaned up considerably and the image is properly scaled to 16:9. This is still a GameCube remaster so don't expect the world, but I've a fondness for graphics from that era anyway so everything looks fine to me. Also, turn off motion blur, because it's atrocious and not the modern, good kind of per-pixel or object motion blur. \n\nWith the tech out of the way, a couple of reasons why Mikami's RE offshoot still remains one of the greatest games ever made. \n\nPacing? Action, exploration and setpiece are carefully balanced and generously doled out with each passing moment. There is zero filler. Tension? Ever present and punctuated by moments of calm and recollection. That amazing 'Serenity' track during safe zones. Variety? You could be careening down a minecart in one moment; fighting your way out of a kill box in the next; be hunted by invisible predators down sewage tunnels; or solve any number of the simple but rewarding puzzles. There is rarely a repeated scenario, and if there is, it's subtly tweaked and inserted where you wouldn't expect it, which takes us to another point: gameplay. Though encounters are generally scripted, how they play out manages to be dynamic each time depending on your preparation and reactions. There is never an idle moment: this ain't a cutscene, PRESS A. The flow of battle is incredible too. You can efficiently shoot heads off, but the plagas that may sprout throw a wrench into your plan. You can line up a rifle shot and clear out rows of enemies like bowling pins. You can incapacitate a leg and go for Leon's suplex (still some of the simplest but most satisfying combos in games). Or you may deliberately time a roundhouse attack for its i-frames. Swapping between attache case and real-time action may seem cumbersome, but it actually affords an almost turn-based pacing to the encounters as you quickly dive into your inventory to swap for a grenade in the heat of the moment - think Parasite Eve on PSX.\n\nRE4 has it all: ageless gameplay, masterful pacing, a cast of exceptionally dumb RE villains and most of all, THE GREATEST reload animations ever. This game is preeeety good.",Recommended
"As we come closer to a decade since Resident Evil 4 was first released for the Gamecube, Capcom decided to tie up some loose ends, remaking the PC version.\n\nSince this is a re-issue and not a brand new game, I think it's better for this review to focus on the improvements and flaws this ""Ultimate HD version"" offers, rather than talking about the game itself. 9 years after its release, I think we all know Resident Evil 4 was a great game, that marked a new direction to the series, aiming towards the Action genre instead of the Survival Horror themed games we were used to back in the day.\n\nComparing this game to the original Ubisoft version is pretty much of an insult... to the Steam version. The Ubisoft version was an awful port that is hard to believe it could come into existence (at least as the status it had when released). Thankfully, there are some good hearted people who tried to fix most of the catastrophic blunders that version had so they could turn it into an actual enjoyable game while we waited for this new version.\n\nThe Steam version comes on and I'm glad to see many of the problems being solved; starting with being able to recognize which key/button to use either with the keyboard or controller, rather than patching the game. Forget about getting crushed by boulders just because you have to guess with key/button is supposed to be ""3"" and ""5"".\n\nThe lighting and shadows look way better than the patch Ubisoft released for their dreadful version. The fact that you can actually destroy torches, affecting the lighting of the ambience, is a good highlight.\n\nThe quality of the textures are good overall, although I'm a little bit disappointed since some of the textures in the fan made ""Albert Texture Patch 2.0"" for the original version looked way better.\n\nThe cutscenes are probably the best improvement in this version; while in the other platforms and versions you could recognize many differences between cutscenes and gameplay, in this one there's no such differences.\n\nThe 60 FPS mode was the hardest thing to get used to. The first times I played the game I felt the sensation that it was going too fast, but I ended up used to it.\n\nThere are, however, some problems I found in this version.\n-In first place, some enemies go crazy. Some Ganados and Garradores use to spin in the same position for no apparent reason.\n-As far as I remember, there's still a poor quality cutscene in the game, specifically one of the first ones in the Separate Ways campaign. In fact, it looks worse than the Ubisoft version ones, and that's saying a lot.\nEDIT: I'm reading some reviews here on Steam from people complaining about the whole Separate Ways campaign to have mediocre cutscenes. So, that makes things even worse.\n-Sometimes, the game drops to a barely playable framerate. It happens mostly when throwing a flashbang to the first plaga that emerges from the head of a Ganado, or during the final battle against Saddler. My PC meets the requirements to play this game with no such problems, but they keep happening.\n-What's up with gravity in this game? When you shoot say, a spinel, from a cave or a wall, it falls at a ludicrously high speed.\n-The amount of achievements in this game are poor. And most of them are so easy to get. Achievements are supposed to be an extra challenge to the player. They could have put, for example, one for destroying a certain amount of torches, or by getting a specific score in The Mercenaries.\n\nOverall, this version is worth the money. It takes one of the greatest games of the last decade and puts it into the quality that PC Gamers deserved on the first place!",Recommended

"To this day, Resident Evil 4 remains one of my favourite games of all time. The much needed evolution of the franchise as the series was becoming stale. As good as the original style games were, this new “action” Resident Evil remains at its core a member of the series. A well balanced mixture of great action sequences and dramatic fight scenes mixed with with classic close quarter “fear” gameplay. The addition of the regenerators towards the end of the game gave players that helpless feeling when facing them ill-equipt. With this game you get your moneys worth, through the length of the main story, the added extras like mercenaries and Ada's story as well as the replay factor. It's my opinion that the game really shines on the second or third play through and I myself have played through the main game 10 times+ on various platforms. My experience of the game has been on my living room TV with an xbox controller and it was the best play through on any platform so far. I'm very pleased to have purchased this game and am pleased to see capcom take PC gaming more seriously and releasing more resident evil games for download on Steam.",Recommended
Mouse support is shit.,Recommended
"An absolutely good classic game with slightly refurbished graphics.\nMost people's favourite Resident Evil game (of the more recent ones). \n\nIt took me around 10 hours to beat, which is a fair amount of hours for a main story these days.\n\nOnly annoying part is the quicktime events, which, lets face it, everyone hates.\n\nI've heard that this is a terrible port, with audio lag problems and stuff, which I can confirm, at least for my weak laptop.\n\nOn my computer however it works perfectly fine at constant 60 FPS at 1080p with all details maxed out, my specs are:\n\nIntel i7-4770 | Geforce GTX 760 | 8 GB ram\n\nAs usual, I strongly recommend using a 360 controller with this game, but I guess any other halfway decent one will do.",Recommended
"In RE4 the traits that make this game good also seem to make it bad:\n\n+ I can aim for the head! \n- It takes longer to turn left than it does to turn around. Also, headshots don't kill anything just because it's a headshot.\n\n+ Quick Time Events (QTE) add suspense and surprise to many boss encounters.\n- QTEs don't telegraph (giving you an indication of what's to come without prior knowledge) other than ""Push two buttons NOW!"". QTE window of opportunity on Normal beats a 30 year-old latency about 40% of the time.\n\n+ A game that doesn't feel like an escort mission. This is pretty substantial given it could have been a TOTAL mess if it felt like one.\n- There are two practical instances of having Ashley with you: she stays put in a hut (or a garbage bin), while you clear the area of bad guys and then call her out OR it's an excuse to have a shooting gallery where ganados (zombie dudes) approach her trying to carry her away. She's used occasionally as a delayed gratification tool where you can't get to a room or an area of the map until she's with you. So, it's just like any of the other mechanics.\n\n+ Open areas to maneuver and combat\n- Your best technique is to put your back against the end of a narrow hallway and wait for them to come to you. This works 65% of the time and will be your rule of thumb. Adding other beasties makes the fights more intense but they also get MUCH more frustrating. This is where the controls, while improved, really start to be the bottleneck between survivng and retrying. \n\n+ Puzzles that aren't [collect and combine three pieces of the key to open the door].\n- Oh wait. This is a Resident Evil review.\n\n+ Boss battles are different and a huge improvement to the genre\n- Some bosses die faster from being knifed (Saddler in ""Seperate Ways"" story) than from being shot with GRENADE ARROWS (Rambo does not approve)\n\n+ Character interactions are longer and build on their history together\n- Character interactions feel scripted by a 17 year old kid that wrote the earlier history when he was 13. Then again, it's a Capcom game so I don't know what I was expecting. Look at Megaman, Street Fighter, etc.\n\nThat all being said, if you take the game into context (or compare it to RE3) the game deserves quite a bit of merit for discarding so many tropes that it had started and still delivering a game that is solid enough to WANT to finish (although it was hard to swallow toward the end). When you do finish, the other additions to the game are a fun diversion that doesn't require the commitment of the entire game (which I'm thankful for these days) but still give a better picture of the story (which is classic RE).\n\nThere are definitely technical gotchas (HD remake using some lower res textures in the wrost places) and the story makes you laugh if you're just coming into it, but I think I would barely recommend playing this game. 3/5 by today's standards.",Recommended
"Bought this and Biohazard 5 from Steam, as I'm a big fan of the original three.  Very dissapointed in both games, they are now just generic 3rd person shooter, generic action, and not survival horror.  Didn't feel like a Recommended RE/Biohazard game, felt like a completely different series, just with old characters and a few puzzles thrown in.  The botton mashing action scenes, which only an autistic who lives in his parent's basement and for whom his video game addiction is his only purpose in life would enjoy.  I will not buy another game in this series.",Not Recommended
"This game will not work on my keyboard. It tells me to sprint with the x key but it doesn't work. It then tells me to dodge the rock by hitting the plus key which does not work. The controls are too far apart and you are forced to move with the arrow keys on the key board instead of the mouse. If I compare resident evil retribution to this game it's like playing packman. Steam is no help at all. This game is not what I thought it was, therefor I tried to exchange it through steam. I never heard from them. Don't wast your money or time with resident evil 4 and forget Steam customer service because it doesn't exist.",Not Recommended
Very good remastered version. Recommended,Recommended
"Alright let's get the nonsense out of the way first.\nAs Leon Kennedy, you have to rescue the president's daughter, kill small-time Saddler, and shoot nearly a thousand not-zombies in the face. This is one of the best games ever made.\n\nSee? Easy peasy fo' sheezy. Millions of people know that this game is totally great, and it's a waste of everyone's time for me to write a long review. Still, I feel obligated to write SOMETHING, because RE4 is that damn good.\n\nRE4 is nearly 10 years old now, and it only seems to get better with age. It's a third-person shooter that has managed to carve out the perfect identity. It's the definition of a classic. But why is that? What is it that RE4 does so well that makes it a genre-defining masterpiece?\n\nLet's start with something basic, sound-direction. One of the most basic ideas RE4 has is that when enemies are nearby, music plays. When the music stops, that means all of the enemies are dead. This is the moment when you can release that tension. RE4 is also one of those games where you're actively harming yourself by playing music over the in-game tunes. Your view is very limited, and all you really have to keep track of your surroundings are your ears. This isn't something you'll notice in RE5 or RE6 because 95% of the time you have a partner. In RE4 your ears are going to pick up every grunt, every foot-step, every little noise, and it's going to save your life.\n\nSpeaking of partners, I honestly think Ashley is underrated. Yeah ok ""LEEEOOOOOOOOOOON"" gets obnoxious, but it's to be expected. This girl is way out of her element, and protag is the only person she can trust(and vice-versa I suppose, if you don't count the merchant). There's all sorts of little moments that make her welcome company. Whenever you do something cool like shoot a hatchet out of the air, she does a little fist-pump. If there is an enemy behind you, she's going to notice. She serves as a good distraction, is quick to get behind you or duck under your gun. The most dangerous areas also tend to leave nice places for Ashley to hide. Still, I dunno...maybe I just appreciate when she's around. It's like I'm getting a psychological buff. It's easy to forget that with all the ass Leon is kicking, that the situation he and Ashley are in is well and truly screwed. Any moment where it feels like things are going right is worth holding onto.\n\nThe controls and mechanics still hold up perfectly. While having all the cool diving moves in RE6 is really nice, there's something to be said about methodically evading all sorts of stuff by walking ever so slightly to the side and/or backwards. It really gives you a feel of just how much weight goes into each encounter. Movement is just so focused and creates the right amount of context. Where you stand determines so much of the enemy's behavior.  It's like an arcade beatemup. Sure you can walk right up and punch everyone, but you're bound to take a bunch of damage in the process. The trick is to move around enough so that your foes are ""herded"". They're in the right position and distance for you to deal with them appropriately. Losing track of enemies is dangerous, because they could get behind you, approach your sides, and then it's back to relying on your ears as well as your eyes to restore some sort of order.\n\nThere's a lot to be said about making do with what you're given, which is where RE4 also shines. A lot of shooters have to push the ""variety"" angle to keep encounters interesting. There's always a new type of enemy, different victory conditions, or just some gimmick. Much of RE4 is spent in combat, and these combat situations are typically Leon in an area surrounded by enemies. Early on he has to rely on blocking doors, throwing down ladders, just to keep enemies at bay. As his arsenal improves he's expected to take fight directly to the enemy, also relying on his advanced maneuverability to stay one step ahead. When old doors close, new ones open, that's what keeps a game engaging, not doing something different at every moment. RE4 knows exactly when to create moments that are actually special, not just different. They're memorable, but unless you're replaying the game you won't have to deal with them again. Whether it's just business as usual or these special moments, the core mechanics and design of RE4 are front and center. It's astonishing just how well Capcom/Mikami gets it.\n\nRE4 also features one of the best campaigns of any time. I'd say it's at just the right length. Some would claim that the game runs a bit too long, and that some parts could trimmed or even cut entirely. This is not something I can agree with.  Nothing really feels wasted in this game. Like okay there's a kinda dumb moment where you use a crane to drop enemies into the garbage disposal. This part of the game follows shortly after discovering the regenerators and (hopefully) finding the means to destroy them. Having a goofy little moment where you toss a few las plagas in the garbage is...kinda nice. Pacing isn't always just pushing for everything to move as quickly as possible. Even very late in the game RE4 has time to throw ideas around. Unfortunately, this probably says more about the rushed nature that game development is all too easy prey for. The end levels tend to be pushed together. The only intention is that hopefully everything doesn't fall apart. RE4 had seemingly all the time in the world to get everything right and it shows.\n\nBack to what I said about the perfect identity. First off, no disrespect to RE5 and RE6. I really enjoy and love those games as well, but they're not RE4. What makes this game such a classic is not something that can be replicated. Even if you could somehow get prime Mikami and top-of-their-game-era Capcom together again and tasked them with doing a 1:1 sequel to RE4, you'd still end up with a lesser title. RE4 is a product of its time, it has limitations, and in a way it makes those into strengths. Sure I'd be curious to see how RE4 part 2 would play with RE6 controls, but it wouldn't be the same.  I guess conceptually it'd be an improvement, but in practice...I don't think it could work. Leon dashing around like he was in a zombie-infested Vanquish sequel? Yeah not feeling that either.\n\nAnyway to sum it all up, play through RE4 again. Appreciate it like you never have before. We'll never see another game quite like it.",Recommended

I really went into this wanting it to be as good/ and upgrade from the ps2 version but sadly poor keyboard controls can not make up for the increased visuals. At launch there was also incredibly low frame rate so I wont judge this rating off that since it has probably been fixed by now but simply because it is RE4 it deservers a solid 9.0 even with its few problems.,Recommended

"Just when you thought Capcom couldn't make another re-release of this golden classic from the Nintendo Gamecube, they slam it into your face again and the screeching hellish words of LEEEEONNNHELLLLLP begin to playback endlessly in the depths of your mind. \n\nResident Evil 4 is my favourite RE title. This set the milestone so high that Capcom have failed to reach the pinnacle of enjoyment that is RE4. This was the title Shinji Mikami created which added 3rd person action and action-horror, resulting in a total masterpiece. The atmosphere is tense, the enemies are confusing to understand and keep screeching at you for your death. You are stuck in place as you shoot, as it's supposed to be in a classic RE game. You are all alone in a hellish environment, forced to fend off against the evil forces around you. \n\nThe music is terrifying. The setting is very eerie. The moment I click ""New Game"" I always remember my first experience playing RE4. I was truly frightened and horrified by these enemies. They look human, act human with each other, communicate with one another, yet they are as insane and rabid as the T-Virus monsters of time past gone. \n\nGameplay doesn't feel dated. This is a title that you can hop right into and feel at home. Those ""Hardcore third person shooter fans"" won't like this at all though, ""why can't you move and shoot? this game is stupid!"" No, that's the point. Mobility was never something you were supposed to have in Resident Evil. You are stuck in place as you shoot. Sure, you have distance v. enemies in this game, yet you can't stay still because Mr. Salvador Chainsaw is running at you at full speed, you gotta move or else you're dead! That's what makes it scary!\n\nEnemy designs are at 99.9%, and as you progress through the game they only get freakier and nastier. You wait. You just wait when you come across *that* enemy. Oh, you have no idea. *That* enemy. And when it RUNS towards you, oh nope nope nope.\n\nThe game is a solid 10 - 12 hours depending on how you play it and how often you die. It's worth the money, and it is by far one of Capcom's finest. Don't expect RE5 to be better. It isn't. Don't think RE6 is better. Don't even play RE6. Don't. Please. It's a terrible game. \n\nResident Evil 4 is what you should play. And enjoy. And love. Show Capcom that this is what we as gamers want, a scary and action packed game with good characters, likeable scenes, memorable moments and frightening settings/enemies.\n\nNot a stupid clusterbuck like RE6.",Recommended

"Can't believe it took me until 2014 to play this game.  I remember reading about this game in Game Informer ages ago thinking the boss photos looked awesome.  (the bosses sure seemed large to me then they did in-game!)  I'd say it holds up well by todays standards.  Some might be bothered by the controls, but as a long time fan of the Silent Hill series I am used to clunky controls and they don't really bother me; in some cases it can actually be an additional horror element.  The story is great, The game even has a seperate storyline called ""Seperate Ways,"" which is unlocked after completing the game.  Where you play from another character characters perspective within the storyline.  Imagine that game developers!  A seperate additional story after completing the game that isn't monetized!  Even though the game is linear there is enough replayability for at least a couple runs as there is plenty to unlock along the way, a new difficulty setting after completion, and you can choose to start with your previous gear from your last save.\n\nNow I finally know why this game was such a big deal to everyone.  If you've played this game already, the PC version looks snazzy as hell, and is currently the best in terms of graphics on any system (I'd dare call it the definitive edition).  The Keyboard+Mouse controls also worked really well for me.  If you haven't played this game before, it is still worth playing in 2014.",Recommended
"With improved textures and better PC options available in Resident Evil 4, this could certainly warrant picking this version up for those who were fans of the game, but it may be best to wait for a price drop or sale, as it doesn't offer anything else new from the prior versions. Also I don't know if it is just me, but the quick-time events on professional mode are freaking impossible without some sort of hotkey mod. Still, even with its few faults, RE4 is still one of the best games in the series and this port is the best version you will get of it.",Recommended

I just love everything about this game.  \n\nIt's a 3rd person action/adventure I suppose, the horror from past games isn't really here.  There is also the Mercenaries mode, professional mode and a slew of add ons made after the original release on Gamecube that gives this game an insane amount of conrent.  The game isn't really scary like former RE games but it's so much fun to play.

"While so far I do only have a limited amount of time in the game, it has one glaring flaw that makes this game nigh unplayable for me. The slow sluggish and baffling controls of Leon. walking feels like he is a zombie with a camera that is fixed directly behind him with very little lattiude given to the right stick to make adjustments. in order to use a weapon or engage in combat of any sort you must pull out your weapon and be unable to move while you aim with a speed that feels abit like an old skill crane machine that hasnt been lubed properly. I have heard that this was to alow for ""persision"" aiming and atmospheare which I call B.S. on both things. A many other games have had more responsive aiming that required persision at the time, such as metal gear solid 2 and 3. and B if you have to handycap your gameplay in order to create atmosphear then frankly IMHO you dont know how to properly do atmosphear. Yes I know RE1 and silent hill used its tech limitations to acomplish that goal but in that case it was honist tech limitations that they had to work around. This is just forced. I will retry with kb/m and see if that improves things for me, but failing that and or a mod that alows for more sensitve movements and free camera I do not think I will be compleating this game.",Not Recommended

"Resident Evil 4\n\nDevelopers Capcom Production / Studio 4\n\nRelease January 11, 2005\n\nGenre Survival Horror\n\nI first started playing Resident evil 4 on the gamecube I was 15. I loved this game right off the bat the story, people, music and gameplay all went together perfectly. I had only ever played one other resident evil game before this one. Resident Evil Director's Cut and loved that game as well.\n\n\nSix years after the events of Resident Evil 2. You are Leon S. Kennedy, U.S. secret service agent. You just got your promotion and your first mission is to go out and look for the U.S. President's daughter who has been kidnapped. What you find in this rural area of Europe that you tracked her to will lead to you saving not only her but, the whole world from a deadly cult of parasite worshippers. It's a nice twist from zombies I liked this story it reminded me of stargate and the goa'uld.\n\n\nThe gameplay in this game is amazing. They got rid of the static camera angles and went third person over the shoulder perspective. You zoom in alittle when using any weapon and can interact with most objects in the game. You can break vases, doors, barrels, lights, etc,. You can kill fish and chickens. The Ganados (Cattle) the main enemies are slow moving pack hunters. When one spots you it will yell and any near by Ganados will come running. As you progress in the game you start to fight the parasites inside the Ganados and all of the other enemies. The Ganados are also very quiet at times if it wasn't for the music I sometimes would have not even known they were coming to get me. I was surprised and took an axe to the face a few times after I thought I killed them all but, missed that one that was sneaking around. I just love the combat it's so much fun. They're are a few quicktime events in the game mostly during boss fights to dodge attacks that adds some fun. It is possible to make though a few boss fights without taking damage if you are just good enough at the QTE's.\n\nThe graphics in the game were great even before it was remastered in HD. Now that it's in HD they are wonderful little details like the items in your suitcase look so much better and blood looks more red and definded. The main characters faces are much more detailed. Even the spiders on the walls in the village look better. They really took thier time when redoing the graphics on this game.\n\n\nThe music on this game is nothing short of a masterpiece. I love the erie music as you are just looking around the village and castle. It switchs up to a more up beat horror theme when a enemy spots you. The boss fights all have wonderful soundtracks. I can't say enough good things about the composers Misao Senbongi and Shusaku Uchiyama they did an amazing job.\n\nSome pro and cons\n\nPros\n\nGreat story\namazing gameplay\nwonderful music\nboss battles, normal battles, QTE's all seemlessly fit together.\nNo more static camera!!!\nyou can suplex enemies!!\n\nCons\n\nI can't really think of any myself this game to me is a masterpiece.\n\nMy total score for this game is a 10/10 it has everything a horror survival fan loves!

"Simply put, this may be as close to perfection an action game could possibly be. Residet Evil 4 was a game changer in the same sence that Metal Gear Solid for the original Playstation was. I owned this game when it was first released for gamecube back around New Years 2005. Having recently played through the game, I can honestly say that no game, in my opinion, has been able to top this. This game is a must own, especially for anyone who has not had the honor of playing through it.\n\nThe HD graphics aren't that much of an upgrade over the original release, but considering tis is essentially a gamecube title, The artwork definitely holds up.\n\nIf you experience slowdowns with the locked 60fps option (and you will), you should try playing at 30fps. The framerate consistency is well worth it.",Recommended
"This version of RE4 delivers on most of the promises as it can be played in 1080p and 60 frames per second with all the settings turned up to max (If your system can handle it that is!). It works great with KB+M or a 360 controller so you can use what suits you best. All is well so far but there are some problems which I have to mention.\n\n1. The textures aren't upgraded much so the visuals will not blow your mind\n\n2. When reloading the bolt-action rifle the fps had a drop (despite being locked at 60FPS) but quickly went back to 60 \n\n3. The climbing up from ledges Quick Time Events to prevent falling are almost impossible to complete on the first try (or the 10 next attempts) and could potentially lead to damaging the buttons on your keyboard or controller you have to mash to complete them (Chapter 4-3 ledge climb and the chase sequence in 4-4 are the biggest offenders)\n\nIf you have trouble with the QTEs I mentioned above, lock the frame rate to 30 via the config.ini, find the part that says variableframerate, change the number from 60 to 30, complete QTE and change it back after you've done it.\n\nThe config.ini is located at: C:\Users\yourname\Documents\My Games\Capcom\RE4 \n\nAlso the cutscene quality in the Separate ways bonus campaign is rubbish but not in the main game which is weird as several of the cutscenes are reused from the main game.\n\nDespite these issues I'd still recommend the game if you've never played RE4. \n\nPersonal rating: 7/10",Recommended

"I remeber loving this game when it came out. One of my faorite for the franchise. But trying to play it on my computer with the keyboard and mouse is pretty much impossible! Very slow and very difficult, even to manuever the character around. I give up until I can get a controller.",Recommended
"as always a residente evil game is always welcoming and even tho i am happy for this game releasing on steam there are a few things they should fix. First the game is not optimized properly both me and my friend seems to have som problems with stuttering and slowdown. i have played through almost 15 hours of this game without sound because whenever enemies enter the scene the sound bugs out and starts stuttering like my audio just took a dump in my ears, and the mouse and keyboard controls meh they are doable but i strongly suggest you get a controller. right now i think you should wait for some kind of patch or a mod that helps optimize the game so you wont run through 15 of sound stuttering if modders could fix dark souls 1 on pc they can sure as hell fix this",Not Recommended
"I expected that since I played this game on the gamecube what feels like a decade ago, it would run on my 2012 Dell Inspiron 17 with i5 processor and 8GB ram without much difficulty.

Dead Rising 2/Off The Record and now Resident Evil 4 gets poorly ported.",Not Recommended
"Resident Evil 4 is widly considered as the best survival horror video game of all time, which is Recommended the game get's a lot of things right in gameplay, design, and presentation.  The story is good too, as it does fit well to the resident evil formula and takes the series into a bold new direction.  6 years has passed since the devestation accord in Raccoon City.  Taking place at Europe in the rural part of Spain, U.S. Government Agent Leon Scott Kennedy is tasked to search for the President missing daughter that has been kindnapped.  Upon his arrival Leon finds out that the village isn't all what it should be as he attacked by not zombies, but by Ganados which are humans infected by the parasite know as Las Plagas.  Leon soon get's injected by the sperm of Las Plagas and only have a matter of time to complete his mission before he'll end up being one of them.\n\nResident Evil 4 retains the series novelty, but also streamlining the frustration that has plagued the series for awhile.  It does away it's complex puzzle, fixed camera angles in favor to a more action-oriented approach, it has the best camera I've seen in RE4 and it does a great job keeping up the frame of the action and showing it's dark, gloomy visuals the game is build upon back in 2005 when it was originally released.  \n\nYou know what, I should say this anyway:  Resident Evil 4 Ultimate HD Edition is a solid port to a great game, it's better then the 360/PS3 version in all aspects since the settings is superb in everyway, there are a huge framerate problems in some areas, but the sence of scale and fun action is enough to enjoy this already excellent game.  Don't expect much out of this version, because this is the same PS2 version you got back in 2005 since it has all the content it needs.  Capcom needs to step up the re-release of these games and give us more of it or stop doing it entirely. (They won't stop doing it thou...)  \n\nThe questionable performance is a curious one since it requires a good computer, but no matter how good your PC is, you will run into framerate issues in this ""Cough"" Ultimate HD Edition.  Still, I recommended for those who wants to experience this legendary horror game for the first time or your playing this because your a fan of the series.  Rest assure, Resident Evil 4 Ultimate HD Edition is a solid port and worth the value it's asking.",Recommended

"Brings back memories from the gamecube and the ps2. I played this game repetitively adn never got boring. It's the only single player game that I would spend a lot of time on. Very good game, even though it has some slow motion into it,  it can be fixed.",Recommended
"A solid action with occasional moments of horror, and in its own right it's a well-crafted and enjoyable game. Long-term players were divided on the change of direction we saw with #4, and I'm personally divided; for me it come down to story and realism\r\n\r\nThe original Resi's were believable, with human (read: mortal) characters who weren't roundhouse kicking or engaging in arial knife fights, they were your average police officers. The virus was a fantastic premise and the non-zombie monsters were mutations of animals or lab projects; this all added to believability.\r\n\r\nIt's a real shame that Resident Evil threw all that away for the generic, over-the-top cartoon characters we have in #4 (well, really Code Veronica onwards to be fair) as this, in my opinion, is the biggest thing that is holding RE4 back. This is more Resident Evil meets House of the Dead in terms of story and characters and would have been incredible as a seperate series from Resident Evil given how far the story has departed from its roots, and it would have been awesome!\r\n\r\nBut anyway, I digress!\r\n\r\nIf you can look past all this (which I recommend you do) you will find a solid and enjoyable action / horror with interesting enemies and combat. Ammo is plentiful and there's plenty of variety in weapons to choose from, which is good as there are plenty of enemies! There is a bit of a tactical approach to combat this time around, as you're able to shoot projectiles out of the air and shooting an enemy in the knee, arm or head will cause different reactions. To be really efficient on harder difficulties you'll want to play skillfully, shooting the dynamite in an enemies hand will blow it up and take out all nearby enemies, and staggering an enemy and roundhouse kicking them will send the group flying (sometimes off cliffs) and then there's the environment...You can baricade doors, jump through virtually any window and kick down ladders. The sense of tension as you have enemies approaching from all angles is very well done.\r\n\r\nSo would I recommend this game? Definitely. It's bittersweet as I think we all know Capcom have lost their way over the years, and this started when they lost their direction with their various series' (what are they doing over there?), but despite that here's a lot of fun to be had here. As a story it was at best a medicore B-movie, but as an action it was second to none for it's time and holds up pretty well even today.",Recommended
"Dead lord does this game have a terrible PC port. First of all when I start the game its in slow motion! I tried changing some of the options like resolution, motion blur, etc, but its not that. Its a bug which needs to be patched up. I've tried looking up how to fix this which I did, which is lowering the FPS but for some reason it wont allow it and it just pretty much doesnt exist. I cant put subtitles on just like FPS and hd mode, and the dialogue in the cutscenes isnt matched up with the animation.

"Probably one of the worst ports I have ever seen. Worse than Dark Souls 1, only because it was fixed by the mod-god Durante. The audio studders, the video goes slow-motion. What's even worse it that a developer made a forum post about it bascually saying it had to due with the graphical settings, which honestly came off as insulting to me. Before anyone questions me, yes, I have looked up multiple *fixes* and tried them all with no luck. My computer should have NO problem running this game. Another big issue I have is with the ""HD"" graphics. I honestly cannot tell the difference between the HD graphics and the original. This is hurtful to me not only because I never had the chance to play this when it came out, but because from what I hear it's the best in the series (IMO 1 and 2 were amazing) and they just demolished it. This review only gets a thumbs down because of the audio and video studders. If these problems were to be fixed in the future then disregard this.\n\nEDIT: Literally right after I wrote this, I seen a few posts about these problems coming up AFTER the latest update, so I rolled it back to versoin 1.2 I believe and everything works great. Even though it runs fine now, they should still implement alot of changes. Changes like a volume meter would be great, or a FOV changer to zoom it out just a tiny bit, as well as fixing the game to run it in 60FPS on HD.",Recommended

The HD is not a big improvement. The atmosphere is unique and well done. Perhaps some day I'll come back to this if I have an Xbox controller handy. In the mean time, it's a complete waste.

"This game holds up perfectly after all these years.  Still one of the most tense and atmospheric video games I've played — and, I would like to point out, largely because of the controls.  Many will whine, ""artificial difficulty!"" but to me they're just as they were in 2005: deliberately clunky yet stylized, oddly stiff and elegant at the same time.  It feels like there's an art to managing headshots and kicks on a crowd of swarming not-zombies, and when you have to move there's a sense of urgency and spatial consideration.  In total, it feels like something halfway between Doom and King's Field, and is quite likely the best Biohazard/RE to date.  The port here is just fine, too, though I've encountered a few fleeting issues with slowdown and stuttering.  Nothing that has kept me from thoroughly enjoying this old favorite.  Oh: the music is really something, as well.  (01/22/15 edit: There are some issues with QTEs tied to the framerate, sometimes leading to issues where QTEs are either too easy or too punishing.  QTEs were the worst part of the game to begin with, aside from a slight decline in the quality of the environments around 2/3 into the game, but they're even worse/weirder here and it does mar an otherwise solid port — albeit one I would still recommend.  Just be forewarned.)",Recommended
"If you don't remember, back in 2005 the Resident Evil francise was pretty niche and regarded as a bit of a fad from the previous console generation. That was until Resident Evil 4 was released that year for the GameCube, blowing everything and everyone away with it's incredible story and mix of Survival Horror and Action/Shooter gameplay.\n\nX-Play (the game review show on G4) went apeshit for RE4, I remember them specifically because I watched that show every night, and rightly so. Its won numerous awards from pretty much every major award giving body in the industry, and has settled at a near perfect 96/100 on MetaCritic (for what that's worth). Now the Resident Evil francise is known as an action oriented horror series, but this game is where it all got started. \n\nI've only played about the first hour of the game, but thats enough to tell you that this is just as good as the original version in performance, but with the added bonuses of the later versions and new ""HD"" textures.\n\nThe controls are exactly like the GameCube's, which some people seem to be complaining about. This game was made for these controls and they only take a second of gameplay to get used to. If learning the controls to a game are going to keep you from playing it, then why do you own a steam account?\n\nThe ""HD"" textures are just ok, they make it look as good as it looked back in 2005, but on your 1080p PC, which is great. Some textures even look better than they used to, but its kinda pick and choose.\n\nOverall, if you've never played this game before, make sure to pick it up now that this is probably the final release of the classic game. If you have played it before, buy it again to play through all the new content! This game will never dissapoint.",Recommended

With a story that both terrifies me and makes me want to keep playing, linear gameplay that still encourages me to explore and has almost seemless chapter transition, an arsenal of weapons that makes me feel badass at one point and barely strong enough at others, and a lead protagonist who screams complete awesomeness, Resident Evil 4 is, for me, the highlight of the franchise as well as the highlight of my entire gaming career.",Recommended
I have never written a review for a game on steam before but felt i needed to with this particular title.

"RE4 is a classic. It is a truly brilliant game in the Resident Evil series that remains unique by mixing horror and action together (can't say the same for its sequels, though). By no means am I giving the game itself a negative rating, but this shoddy PC port gets my thumbs down.\n\nWhen playing the game at first, everything moved in a slowed-down manner (my PC system is above the recommended system requirements, BTW). I looked up the forums to see how to fix the problem, and I altered the game options in accordance to suggestions (keeping anti-aliasing off, switching to 30 fps, turning off motion blur, lowering shadow quality, and turning off HD). The game now runs fine, just as smooth as the game originally did on GameCube and PS2 although some of the graphically busier moments still go rather slow.\n\nThis is a 9-year-old game, and even then it lags at certain moments. Capcom seriously needs to make a patch to fix this problem. Considering it's an HD release and is supposed to run fine at 60 fps, it's pretty sad how many people aren't able to play the game at its maximum settings. If you have a GameCube, a Wii, or a PS2, or X-Box 360, go ahead and play the game on its console format. This PC port has too many issues.\n\nIn short...\n\nPROS: Same great RE title released 9 years ago, now includes achievements, includes all extra features that weren't in the original GameCube release.\n\nCONS: Shoddy PC port with major unresolved issues, doesn't include English subtitles in spite of what the store page says, retails here for $20 yet the game is nearly 10 years old ($15 seems more reasonable), PC controls feel clunky compared to smooth feel on the GameCube and PS2 (I've played those two versions before, but not Wii or X-Box 360).",Not Recommended

"As a veteran of thr classic Resident Evil's, I suggest you buy this. I have been playing this series since 1998, and this one is still by far the best mix of the modern industry Resident Evil, and the older industry Resident Evil. This game has only a few puzzles compared to the originals, but they are very complex and are lengthier than the older ones. The gameplay mechanics are very solid, but they feel nothing like the older games. The only things I have to complain about are the QTE's, those in general have only been a cheap way to kill you quickly, and plus, they don't seem to be that optimized for 60 FPS. And last, the Seperate Ways cutscenes are not in HD, which is killer on the eyes if you had gotten used to the main games HD scenes.\n\nThis is one game you have to have on your bucket list if you haven't finished it. But please check out the originals as well, sure they are clunky, but hopefully you will have a new found appreciation to what the classics did to the survival horror genre.\n\nPros:\n-Great gameplay that holds well after all these years.\n-It has a great feeling in terms of survival, it makes you feel panicked when you don't have any ammo for anything, and there's a Regenerator around the corner.\n-The movement feels very fluid in 60 FPS.\n-It has a great atmosphere.\n-The music can make you tense (well, it does for me anyway).\n-Puzzles that will make you think for a while (can also be a Con).\n-Dr.Salvador is love, Dr. Salvador is life.\n-Great ballistics on Ashley.\n\nCons:\n-The graphics are decent in HD, but I think they could've done a little bit more work.\n-There was a time where I had to switch to 30 FPS, because of the QTE's not being optimized for 60 FPS.\n-Seperate Ways cutscenes are not in HD (what the hell man?).\n-WAIT.

The Remake brings back old memories and brings in some new ones, now that I'm playing it on PC. It is an old time favorite, and in my opinion, the best Resident Evil game in the series.",Recommended

"A wonderfully tense game, Provides a great atmosphere. The mechanics are detailed in that the game has many Hidden ways to accomplish things that you wouldn't expect due to restrictions usually in games. I won't spoil too much.\n\nOne thing to note is that the Controls are Very difficult. The aiming is slow and jittery, But they are supposed to be this way. The game would be a lot less tense and scary if you could Kill all the enemies in 10 seconds with Pinpoint accuracy. \n\nI highly recommend it, especially with a controller. If you can not get used to the slow movement and aiming then i recommend you do not as the game will just become a nuisance to you.",Recommended
"Bit of a let down to be honest.\n\nI mean... whilst I'm sure the gameplay is good and the metascore is definitely decent; a port that was promised to live up to the best version, sadly... just doesn't. Keyboard and mouse controls could have been a bit more refined, but they seem to have been implemented in the cheapest, easiest and most convenient way possible and I could say the same with the 'HD' graphics. Everything about this port just seems rushed, budgeted and minimalistic.\n\nStill, I do recommend it for people that have never played RE:4, but if you already own any version; save those pennies.",Recommended
"This game right here...I first played RE4 on the system it was originally released for (Nintendo Gamecube) and it became one of my favorite games of all time. I have beaten this on many of the other systems as well for the gamecube countless times thats when you know you have a great game.\n\nWith this new release it looks outstanding and better than any of the versions before this. As you could probably already tell I LOVE this game,I know what the characters are going to say before they say it..thats how much I LOVE this game. If you have never played any of the Resident Evils but wanna give it a chance I think you will like this one.",Recommended
"When released back in 2005, Resident Evil 4 was the first in the series marking a shift away from the Survival Horror genre to a more Action-oriented style, with an over-the-shoulder perspective. Whilst this game retains a haunting soundtrack and fear inducing moments of its predecessors, some ' Old Skool ' fans of the series will miss the older pre-rendered backdrops and thought provoking puzzles which made the first 3 games genuine classics. This 2014 HD-remastered version has been polished and boasts a smoother 60fps framerate. Resident Evil 4 was originally released for consoles, so you'll get the best playing experience using an Xbox 360 controller. My only gripe with this port is the audio during weapon reloading is out of sync, and more effort should have been given to keyboard & mouse support.",Recommended
"Resident evil 4 is a complete Gem. I love this game to death and I always will. The story is outstanding and rather fun once you've done your first playthrough. Then the game drags you back in due to new costumes and weaponry that are able to be bought with your peso's. Although the game itself can get a little bland after 3 -4 playthroughs. although gaining money and buying the Infinite tommygun and infinite RPG are a rather hard goal to acheive as is getting the Smith and wesson 500, but once the goal is acheived the game becomes fun again due to literal killing of everything. No matter what it is. I haven't played much on pc due to issues with the game itself, but I have played it significantly on xbox and ps2. I enjoy my time with it and I will continue to play it as if it were brand new. There's always something to do in RE4. I recommend this game very highly.",Recommended

"TL;DR\nPretty good, slightly overrated I think. 8/10ish\n\nDefinitely a good game, even a great one at points. The few final chapters began to drag and the atmosphere shifted dramatically at points and rather than being dark and foreboding it just felt like I was playing a military shooter. It's definitely not as guilty of it as it's sequel, however I feel RE5 did it better, with better controls and the help of a partner to divide the enemies and manage them better. Allows for hordes of enemies to be difficult but never too overwhelming; seeing as at a lot of points in RE4 they sent dozens of enemies at you alone and the difficulty was coming mostly from the sheer number of things trying to kill me.\n\nThe majority of the boss fights were challenging to an extent, however none of them ever felt REALLY satisfying as a result of the clunky controls. It basically came down to \n\nLots of ammo and health? If yes, defeat boss. If no, lose continually until you get lucky or make no mistakes. It just felt ad though it had a lot to do with reservation of resources up to that point and less to do with player skill or input. It never happened to me, though I combed every area for ammo and resources, I could potentially see someone getting to a difficult boss and running out of ammo entirely.\n\nOverall the characters were at best OKAY at worst, obnoxious, stereotypical and cheesy. Some of the best storytelling for me was just reading the notes left throughout levels. Most of the worst involved Ashley or overly dramatic death scenes relating to characters I felt no attachment to.\n\nMy favorite characters were definitely Ada and Luis (despite how short of an appearance he made.)\n\nMy least favorite being Ashley and Saddler.\n\nThe history and setting are arguably more interesting than what is actually occurring in the game, but I think that's always been common in the Resident Evil series, the focus is broad and the story as a whole continues through all the games, I find the whole ""get the president's daughter back!"" thing to be kind of pathetic considering it's basically the main focus and Leon never wavers to remind you of that, despite the fact the picture is much larger and the rest of the picture is a lot more vibrant and interesting to me.\n\nOverall a very solid game, started feeling like a task in the latter half and the design seemed noticeably more rushed, this game's story was rather boring, however the story of the whole series is pretty interesting.\n\n8/10ish in my opinion.",Recommended

Sure it is not a very scary game (until the player arrives at ""the island"" and meets certain creatures) but it doesn't mean it's even remotely worse than it's predecessor. This game influenced the way modern shooters, action games and survival horrors are made. No wonder it is one of the highest scoring games in history. I highly recommend it to everyone who is looking for some fun!

So, here I am, 80 percent of the way through the game and stuck in the castle room with all of the armor knights. After checking the system requirements, i spent 20 dollars on this and cannot even get to the multiple play throughs that i love so much. Thanks for putting potato system requirements Steam.

If you want to use mouse and keyboard fine but, you are adding more challenge If you do so.",Recommended
"with this HD re-release of re4, you can finally experience the classic horror all over again. that is, you can wrestle with the horrible controls (experience the tension of not being able to move like a normal person!), the terrifying gameplay (each enemy still requires a minimum of five headshots to kill - face the existential dread of unending tedium!) and of course, the spine-chilling story (by which i mean the two or three kinda funny cheesy one-liners that leon say. the actual story still isnt very memorable). in this game you will do battle with countless undead monstrosities... by which i mean the gameplay elements, which were already dead and buried when this game dug them up straight outta the ps1 graveyard! much like a zombie, this game hasnt aged gracefully.... and also like a zombie, it really bites! zoinks! and of course, like all RE games, this game has a lot of challenging puzzles... the first of which is ""where is the uninstall button""!",Not Recommended

"I bought this game for GameCube back when it first came out. I've also owned it on PS2 and now through Steam on PC. All-in-all, I can tell you that this is a very good game - the fact that I've bought it 3 times should tell you something. This is by far my favorite of the Resident Evil series games, after playing all of them, minus Code Veronica. The story is very well thought through and to back it up, it takes a solid 12-15 hours of gameplay for a seasoned player that knows all of the tricks in the game. There are 3 main areas in the game, starting in a Village, progressing to a Castle, then onto an Island. (Each takes several hours to complete.) This has always been among my favorite games ever since i first played it 7+ years ago, which is why i was thrilled as hell to see it remastered and put onto a PC version. Controls are easy to configure/get used to wrether you're using a controller or the keyboard/mouse. If you're not new to this game, but worried that the remastering of this game changed it too much - don't be. There have been zero glitches so far for me and the graphics didn't really change that much tbh, other than removing some pixel blur here and there, which adds up for a better visual experience. It's just as I always remembered it when I was a little kid that dumped his birthday money on this game for the GameCube. Overall, I would gladly go out of my way to recommend this game. It has great replay value, due to higher difficulties, game-modes, and bonus weapons/costumes unlocked through beating it in each difficulty. A solid 9/10 from me overall - even in today's standards. Well worth every penny, and long enough to justify $20. To be honest, I'm surprised that Steam didn't charge more due to it's remastered version.",Recommended

"Resident Evil 4 is one of my favorite games of all time, and the PC controls make a good game better. Playing with a mouse is a great improvement over a thumbstick. \n\nThe QTEs (Quick Time Events) have been made easier. In previous versions, the QTEs would involve a random set of buttons each time you faced a QTE event. This meant that, if you missed one input while running from a boulder and were then curshed by the boulder, you would have no idea what buttons you would need upon respawn to succeed, and might die agian to the same QTE. For RE4 on Steam, however, the QTEs have been adjusted to be the same for each singular instance. There is no way to eliminate the QTEs from the game, however.\n\nThe RE4 options menu is surprisngly basic, but if you have a low-end machine you should be able to manage 30fps with ""classic"" textures (the same way the game ran on the Gamecube).\nGameplay:\nhttp://youtu.be/lfs85XRMC6Y",Recommended

(Once you've beaten the game) My only gripes are that I wish Mercenaries Mode had an online leader board, the cut scenes (especially during Ada Wong's campaign) were updated along with the rest of the game so they didn't look so blurry and pixelated, and that the controls were a lot more stable and cohesive. The keyboard controls are fine, but the xbox controls are way off and really hard to grasp and not intuitive at all.\n\nOther than that, I look forward to the HD texture mod coming out soon, and for the price, if you enjoy the nostalgia or you just want to add this to your collection, I think it' a great buy.",Recommended

"My first experience with Resident evil 4 was with the Wii edition which included all the extra content from the PS2 and I simply had a blast with it. This port kinda resembles the Wii version with all the extra content and some slightly improved graphics. I say slighty because most of the other textures still look blurry but we're talking about a 9-year old game here. \n\nStill, this is by far the best port of RE4 and you should pick it up if you haven't done it yet.",Recommended
"I've played and owned this third-person shooter/survival horror masterpiece countless times before. I have some complaints, all of which are very minor:\n-I could only run this game efficiently at 30 FPS, windowed, and with low shadow quality. This of course may vary based on your own set-up.\n-I still have to open my inventory every time I want to switch weapons.\n-Lack of new content. This can also be a good thing. After all, if it ain't broke, don't fix it.\n\nNow the good:\n-Even at 30 FPS, windowed, and with low shadow quality RE4 still looks FANTASTIC. Honestly, the differences I saw between HD and Standard are so slight they may as well not exist.\n-Keyboard/mouse controls have that 'getting used to' phase, but quickly become very easy to use and responsive.\n-It's Resident Evil 4, need I go on?",Recommended

My first time ever playing this game was here on steam and I admit it needs a couple adjustmants here and there to get it to play correctly but in the end once you've got your specs and changes right the game is fun as hell! Only drawback is that you need a good graphics card and a high resolution to play this beast of a game. I'd recommend this game to anybody with a computer that can play it.,Recommended

"I'm going to discuss the quality in this purchase in two ways: in the first paragraph I'll talk about how it is as a port, and on the second I'll talk about how the gameplay stands up.\nIn case you don't want to read the full review, I'll just come out: It's a bad port to a good game\n\nSo why is this a bad port? Well first of all, the automatic framerate is set to 60 fps. Now I run a good computer (flawlessly playing skyrim with 70 mods good) but when I played it with that setting the whole game slowed down. I felt like I was watching a slow-mo replay that never stopped. There really is no excuse for that from a ten year old game. I changed it from 60 to 30 fps, and it worked perfectly for me. HOWEVER, I noticed on the reviews some complained about headaches from the jumpiness of the framerate, which they say must have been below 30. Honestly, I didn't notice. I felt fine. So, if you're sensative to that kind of thing, be wary. But like I said, I didn't feel a change. The aiming also can get a bit janky, but honestly, the fact I can use the mouse made up for that. The other thing is that the controls can be REALLY weird. They were already weird on the gamecube, but hell: if you want to rotate an item in your inventory you have to use the ""delete"" button. And they never tell you. And you can't change it. (I'd be angry at Capcom for this impossible to guess choice of button, if it wasn't for the fact I was legitimately concerned with Capcom's mental well being. xD) Then there is the promise of HD textures. HD?! More like Hardly Different! AM I RIGHT, FOLKS?! But no, seriously, there is nothing HD about it. (That being said the standard graphics really aren't bad, so eh.)\n\nSo does this game hold up today? YES. Is it fun? YES. Does the poor quality of the port get in the way of fun too much? NO. Really, if this port is the only one you can get your hands on, you should get this (unless, of course, the headache issue above may be a problem for you). I was told that some of the later Resident Evil games (that I didn't play) became repetative and boring. Resident Evil 4 doesn't, and it does this a few ways: There is a constant difficulty, you always have to worry about a zombie flanking you, or just about the sheer force of the enemy; the enemies are often varried, not excessively, but enough that things are spiced up, and the level design is just really good. There is a section where you're in a castle for a long time, so the game designers are like, ""You know what be cool... A room full of lava... And there are dragon flame thrower things... Bro... That'd be so cool."" and then they did. And it was. (to be fair, this probably should have broken my immersion. It didn't. But it should have.\nIf a survival horror game has a lava-dragon room, you know repetitive environments are NOT an issue. xD\nThe shooting itself is a bit weird, only allowing you to move or shoot, not both. I feel like this is actually a really good choice, it makes it so where you position yourself is more important (Tactics!) and it means you have a steady enough aim to get proper headshots (Gore! Sometimes!). Ammo conservation is also a big deal if you're not careful, it can get really tense when you realize you don't have many shotgun rounds to fall back on.\nThe dialogue is literally the cheesiest thing I've ever heard, but it's one of those ""so bad it's good"" situations, and the story itself is... Okay, I suppose. You're certainly not going to be playing it for the story, anyway. You'll be playing for the gameplay. DID I MENTION THE GAMEPLAY IS GOOD? YES? AT LEAST FIVE TIMES? GOOD. LET ME TELL YOU A FEW MORE. This is a good game, it's just good. I had fun. It was a fun time.",Recommended
"What can I say.  This is hands down one of the best games ever made.  The mechanics might seem outdated, but that's one of the best parts about it.  It seems like the only way for a shooter to avoid being a CoD clone is for it have been released before CoD became be!  11/10 if you like games play it.",Recommended
"\nIf you've never played a RE game before then I suggest you give this one a go. \nI use to play this one on Gamecube all the time when it was first released so playing it again now after so many years feels like I'm experiencing it all over again which is a very rare feeling to get from something thats been out for nearly [i]ten years[/i].\n\n\nCompared to the rest of the series this one out shines the lot. [u](Avoid 6 at all costs)[/u]\nThe only issues I've noticed with this port is the occasional slow down due to it being locked at 60fps.\nAlso, for anyone wondering, the keyboard and mouse support is much better compared to the original pc release so fear not. \nAnd the controller support is alright, but after ten minutes using a mouse I'd rather stick to K+M.\n\nReally good game, if you see it on sale I highly suggest picking it up.",Recommended

"To those who dont know about Resident Evil, it is a third person survival horror game which originaly started with the eponymous first game back in 1996. I have previously played all of the resident evil games, bar this one, the 6th one and any of the spin off games (eg. Racoon city) Many people dont like anything post Resident evil 4, beacause they believe that after the 4th installment, they started to drift away from survival horror and  more into generic shooters. I totaly agree with this statement, but even though this is the first game in the series that started to drift away, it is still a very solid game in the series and one of my personal favourites.\n\n This version of the game compared to the console versions, is by far the best. It allows you to Switch  between the old textures from the gamecube for example to the new HD textures. It also now runs at 60 fps for the first time ever.\nIt also has an amazing story that also keeps you intrested and many things to keep you intrested even after you finish the game. \n\nSo in conclusion,\n\nPro's-\n-amazing story\n-Brilliant graphics\n-Plenty of Replay value, Extra game modes Etc.\n-Incredably cheap price for what you get\n\nCon's\n-The first game in the series that started to slowly drift away from Survival horror\n\nI would give the Game itself 10/10, One of my favourites if not my favourite in the series. Only complaint is the fact that it began the slow drift from survival horror, but that doesnt make it a bad game. Also the PC version is undoubtably the best version of the game, is you are looking to buy it make sure you get it on PC.\n",Recommended

"I played Resident Evil 4 obsessively back in college, with friends and most often with alcohol. We never got tired of one-upping each other's Mercenaries high scores and trying to see how far we could get on Professional mode without dying. When I saw there was an HD port of it, I couldn't resist. So how did it stack up to the memories?\n\nFor starters, it looks beautiful. It struck me several times while playing how much creepier some of the enemies were (the dogs, the Regenerators, etc.) with the graphic overhaul. It also played great on my cheap little Logitech gamepad, no problems aiming or controlling Leon at all. It was also...well, let's say extremely reasonable when it comes to getting achievements. The hardest is beating it on professional mode, and while no small feat, I appreciated the dearth of BS ""would never do this in a million years if it weren't for a cheevo"" type accomplishments.\n\nThe biggest con would be the occasional slowdown. I usually got this when exiting the merchant's shop and once in a rare while after closing my inventory. It's not a deal-breaker, but it was a bit annoying.\n\nOther than that, if you were a fan of the original, get this one as well! Running through one of the best games in the series is a real treat.",Recommended

"Probably one of the best games ever made. \nGameplay, pacing, graphics, all of it still the pinacle of what an action game should be. \nIf you have the GC version, this one has all the extras the PS2 version had, but without the crappy graphics. \nOptimization is ok, you can now play at 60 fps, with little to no slowdowns. \nDo yourself a favor and buy this masterpiece.",Recommended
"Ultimate HD as a port:\nResident Evil 4 is a game that has been ported nearly as much as Duke 3D at this point\nResident Evil 4 Ultimate HD Edition (or as steam calls it resident evil 4/biohazard 4) has a dislike by purists calling the Wii version superior and the this port awful.\nWhich is pretty harsh considering RE4s last venture to Windows.\nI can't help but disagree though as my experience replaying this game was much better than playing on the previous console versions.\nIts nearly identical to the Wii Version in terms of content featuring all the modes and costumes.\nThe differences really come down to the speed and look of the game, which has changed in this port\nUltimate HD really pushes the fact that its now 60 fps, and thats mostly Recommended excluding a fair amount of animations that seem unoptimized for the transition (Granted the game still allows a fixed 30fps for those who want a more vanilla experience). \nAnother thing HD has is 'HD' textures, which is a stretch being only some of the games textures are actually given this treatment, and as with any makeover it changes some of the original look. Its also somewhat jarring to see some of the HD textures next to clearly unchanged texture. I can't justify complaining too much about this either as the original textures are still an option and there is already a fan made one up for download. \nThe color looks warmer but there are 4 color filters, the last looking more similar to the Wii/Gamecube version and there is a fan made color filter made to emulate the Wii/Gamecube look. \nI hear some people having issues with quick time events and other button prompts at 60 fps, but having played this with the current patch with a 360 controller I have had no issues.\nI also have heard of slow downs and crashing, and I haven't had those either.\nThe one thing I can agree with is poor keyboard and mouse controls, having played this with a 360 controller though, I had no issues with the presets given. \nAnother small quip is that you there is no quit to desktop from the game pause menu, as its set up similar to the console version.\n\nI really only have 2 complaints aside from K+M controls:\n1. No English subtitles, which is a real bummer for me as the option was in all previous versions and I generally have difficulty with dialogue.\n2. The Steam overlay has some sort of issue with this game, it really doesn't work.\n\nThe game is only slightly taxing to my PC at max settings giving me no problem performance wise, I really think most the complaints come from the port upon launch.\n\nIn short: This isn't The Silent Hill HD Collection, pretty much all of the changes can all be reverted and there is a purpose to this port as the last Windows port was pretty much garbage without fan mods/patches. All the content is here and I would argue that its the best version of Resident Evil 4, even though its mainly just because it contains the same game, ready to play on PC without the ABSOLUTE NEED to mod but still the ability to.",Recommended
"If you like resident evil games (OLD STYLE) this is the game for you. The controls are old school and will feel weird at first. The game has no strafing, so to turn you need to stop and use keyboard or joystick. LIkely a conroller is best for this game.\n\nOnce you get past the controls (they are not bad, just based on old gaming styles) the game is really tough and cool. \n\nGraphics might make a difference as this game is old as hell. I would watch some gameplay videos to make sure you would enjoy the style. Having top stop and slowly turn to kill zombies is annoying but also gets your heart racing. Several times I had to pause the game because my chest was pounding.",Recommended

"Resident Evil 4 is the game the franchise reinvented itself with. Gone are the static camera angles, the ""high-mid-low"" aiming system, and the puzzle-focused and ammo-starved trappings of its forefathers. In its place is a comprehensive melee system, precision aiming, weapon upgrading and a behind-the-back third person camera. Many will argue these are improvements, and I largely agree, but Resident Evil 4 also crystallized the downfall of the series. It's a trend that arguably started in Resident Evil 3 and Code Veronica, and by this point, more games have been made in the relatively newer style of Resident Evils then the old ones.\n\nSo what is this game, exactly? A third person shooter with horror trappings and plenty of enemies to fight, with a few puzzles and explorable regions for good measure. Resident Evil 4 is one of the last installments to feature back-tracking, and even then it has it in very limited amounts. Instead, you find yourself almost always pushing forward. Rarely are you truly strapped for ammo, as you can carry an expansive arsenal. It also doesn't feature inventory management for puzzles, and the puzzles themselves are straightforward. There are very few secrets to be found in the game, as well. Still, the rewarding gunplay mechanics, the weapon upgrades, the fresh direction for the story and the solo focus are hallmarks of the game. Let's not forget the numerous memorable bossfights, the iconic merchant, the weapon upgrade system, and the animations and sound work.\n\nOn replay, especially after so much time, this HD re-release of the PC version will show its faults. The castle segment remains goofy and out-of-this-world, and the later ""tactical zombies"" that start showing up cement its transition into action-comedy, though the breath of fresh air that is the regenerators steals back some of the atmosphere. Some bosses are rather simple, others are exciting and interesting, like the Verdugo and Krauser. The story is thin and entirely new, with Umbrella's defeat being proudly announced at the start of the game.. this has the result of making the game's plot feel like a side-chapter, which it honestly is. The game is however a classic, and greater than the sum of its parts. This is easily a 9.5/10 game. However, it's not survival horror, and this is the game that forever changed the series. All games that come after this--especially Resident Evil 6--have completely lost sight of the franchises roots, and are so busy that they make Resident Evil 4 seem flawlessly elegant. If you're looking for a solid but (by today's standards) aged third person shooter with a creepy vibe at times, and an 90s action movie vibe at others, this is a worthy investment.",Recommended

"As i look through all the other reviews, this game gets really hit hard on the controls of the game. As i played it (way back when the PS2 was big (and beating it 6+ times)) i remember the controls being just as, in my opinion, good. Yes, they are not what RE6 is (which i  agree that i like being able to move and shoot, and dodging too). However, this game would be overly easy if they were to put these controls into the game. Thus, though only playing the game 5 hours, this is still just as good of a game as it was when it came out. The only thing that i could really say bad about the game is the random crashes (which irritate me to no end).",Recommended
"I've been playing Resident Evil since RE2 on PS1 and I think it's been one of the most enjoyable video game series ever, with the exception of RE6 which I did not like due to all the cut scenes.

If you haven't had the chance to play RE4 and you like 3rd person shooters with achievements, then you should definitely play RE4!\n\nA few things I like about RE5 that should be on RE4 would be the system for buying and selling weapons and the chapter select playthroughs. If those were in RE4 it would be awesome, so that's something I think the creators could come out with in the future for RE4 and maybe some new add on modules to go with it\n\nMy only other wish now would be to have the original RE creator redo RE1,2 and 3 in HD :)",Recommended

"I remember vividly the first time I ever got Resident Evil 4. It was a midsummer day when I was 13. At that time i had finished laser tag and was stuffing a bunch of warheads with my friend. When my mom drove me home I anxiously gazed at the mailbox, waiting for my copy of Resident Evil 4. I opened up the box expecting no copy of the game or just a lousy famiy letter that reminded me of that wedding I dreaded to attend. But oh fuck I was wrong. There sat the face of Leon S Kennedy, with his emo haircut and the chainsaw guy in the background. Holy shit. This was thr first time I was allowed to play a violent video game. I ran right out of the car about to scream in excitment but I had the candy in my mouth. I choked and had to have my mother pound my back untill the 5 warheads were shot out of my mouth. I barely had any oxygen and if my mom didnt come i might have died, but I was so happy. Afterwards I took that disk and shoved it into my gamecube. I got into the farm and my head was chain-sawed off. My mom saw it and freaked out. She was wondering wether she should let me play those games. But she saw how happy I was and just said to herself: ""that boy will someday realize how stupid video games are"". Hell no! I stopped at the castle when my dad pulled me out of the game and my friend got scared of the game.\n2 years later and i see Resident Evil 4 on steam and i was eating a sandwich, I choked again but this time while I was choking I put my credit card information on it and bought it.

It was like DLC's, but console in consoles till i get this reworked PC version. Should you get it? Of course, if you don't you'll probably be missing one of the greatest games from the 6th generation of gaming consoles. Whatever the graphics, modeling and animations.

Although the pace and setting are different, the survival horror elements mix amazingly well with the action-shooter elements.\n\nPlaying this game at 60FPS is its own reward, and the updated graphical textures on some objects still holds up today. Sadly, the game's water physics are horridly outdated, giving water effects an almost cartoony, rubbery look. Regardless, this is something very minor and does not detract from the absolutely solid gameplay presented in this title.",Recommended

"First time i have ever played resident evil 4. So i was expecting to really enjoy it after what everyone said, the problem is that the port is so piss poor that it ruins the experence. The game suffers from bad fps drops and audio lag in cutscrenes. As well, the game seems to drop to 10 fps on 60 fps when i look at water. However on 30fps it seems fine. I will say that my computer isnt good by no stretch of the imgineation. I can play most modern games on medium to low while games like Watchdogs and Arma 3 i can't play with more than 15fps. But this is a 10 year game, as well, an updated version of said game. I wasn't expecting it to look good but at least not have the problems that i currently have. There are work arounds but even then. BUY AT YOUR OWN RISK!",Not Recommended

"A wonderfully HD version of the very satisfying installment to the Resident Evil series. The new enemies the protagonists face are differing from the usual zombies, they are somewhat intelligent and capable of operating devices and weapons. Although they are much slower than the average human being they are also much more durable. This creates a fresh form of antagonist that allows for a much more diverse array of scenarios and battles beyond shooting at copy-pasted hordes of unintelligbles. It is also a much more enjoyable game than Resident Evil 5 for the average player as it does not force the individual to rely on rather clumbsy A.I. or the unreliable online partner or restrict you to playing co-op with a friend. On its own Resident Evil 4 shines.\n\nAs for a Gamecube to PC transition the graphics are well remade and the controls to a 360 controller are wonderful and smooth .",Recommended
"An old classic. There isn't much to be said about it that probably hasn't been said before, so I'll just strongly encourage you to buy it. Sure, it's a little dated, but it's a decade old. RE4 is by far the most fun of the entire franchise, and some parts still give me goosebumps. The only downside is, of course, the gameplay mechanics that plague (ha!) Resident Evil. It's clunky on purpose, to drive up the stress you feel during combat. But RE 4 takes what should be frustrating and turns it into a rewarding victory when you do succeed. Most of the game is an escort mission, but Capcom even managed to make that seem fun too. Your charge is smart and durable. She makes her way to safety and fights to keep from getting caught. Just don't try to look up her skirt. Yes, I'm serious.\n\nYeah, sometimes the dialogue sounds like someone put a bunch of lines into a hat and just drew them at random, but the story still progresses with the help of the stiff but somehow likeable characters. The action more than makes up for canned conversations. You'll fight your way out of gloomy castles, rained out villages, and the obligatory Resident Evil laboratory. The puzzles aren't really demanding, but you're not here to play Myst, are you? \n\nBottom line: get it even if RE4 is the only RE game you'll ever play.",Recommended

"Let me just say at the top of this review that I think Resident Evil 4 is a fantastic game. My playtime at the time of the writing of this review indicates that I haven't played this game all that much, but I should point out that I have beaten the game twice before in a different version of the game. Highly recommended, I say. \n\nNo, this is more of a review of the port rather than the game, and perhaps you may want to consider looking at a version of the game that isn't this one.\n\nCapcom clearly didn't put forth a ton of effort into the PC port of the HD version of Resident Evil 4, originally released last year for the Xbox 360 and Playstation 3. One could be forgiven for thinking that the delay was likely for the purposes of optimization    and the inclusion of standard PC options, but Capcom will occasionally pull an Ubisoft and delay PC ports for aribtrary reasons, just for them to end up performing suboptimally (see also: the kerfuffle going on about the upcoming Dead Rising 3 port).\n\nThey did at least put in a handful of the standard PC options, so it's not entirely bad news. The list of options includes fairly standard anti-aliasing settings, anisotropic filtering, and turning off the godawful motion blur. Allegedly you can turn off v-sync in a config file that I have yet to locate on my computer (for some reason it doesn't exist in the location that I've heard it's supposed to be, so either that's just a problem on my end, or I'm working with outdated information), and sweet, sweet 60 FPS (unfortunately capped at that or 30, but acceptable for a port of a 9-year-old game). What they get wrong, however, are a couple of key factors that keep me from recommending this version of the game. The aformentioned 60 FPS option is quite the boon, but it does run into some issues that are largely attributed to dodgy optimization. The game speed tends to slow down as the framerate chugs, which can be very distracting. I wasn't experiencing too much of this after turning down a few settings, but your mileage may vary, as is the nature of PC gaming.\n\nThat first issue I could probably deal with, but it gets worse. Usually I don't tend to expect a field-of-view slider in a third-person game, but dear God this game in particular needs one. The over-the-shoulder camera angle in games like this or Gears of War I feel lends itself to the problems of a low FOV in a first-person game a lot more than in games like Max Payne or Grand Theft Auto, where the camera is farther away from the player character. It's arguable that such games should possibly include one anyway for accessibility's sake, however I do understand why Capcom might not have considered it since most people likely played this game originally on a TV at a farther distance than one would be playing the game from a desk. There does technically exist an FOV mod, but as of this writing it doesn't work on the current version of the game. \n\nEven that I could get past by taking a break every half-hour or so. It's not ideal, but not a deal-breaker either. However this game commits what I consider to be a cardinal sin for a PC port of a shooter. This game has built-in mouse acceleration. Highly noticeable and affecting mouse acceleration. And there's no way to turn it off. No fix currently exists. This makes aiming in this game far more difficult than it has any reason to be. A lack of consistancy in the mouse sensitivity makes the case that the Wii version is BY FAR the most well-controlled version of the game. Comparing it to PC...that just shouldn't be the case. This issue alone I think makes it difficult to recommend this version of the game. I just don't see myself being able to put up with this nonsense throughout the entire game, and I'd imagine others would feel the same way.\n\nThere are a couple other issues the port has, such as some very noticeable audio de-sync going on in some of the cutscenes. I think I heard that this might be less of an issue depending on how well your machine runs the game, but I think it still bears mentioning, as the delay can get to be embarassingly large. One cutscene in particular had AT LEAST a full second of delay where the visuals were behind the audio. Still, issues such as this one are pretty much nitpicks compared to the awful mouse acceleration.\n\nIf this game gets a fix in the future, even if it's just through mods, I may revise this review and possibly give it a recommendation simply because the game itself is just that damn good. As it stands, I just can't recommend this right now. If you see this game on sale in the future and are tempted to buy it, I'd check pcgamingwiki.com or the Steam forums to see if the major issues have been resolved. If so, go for it. Otherwise, just pass, even if the price is attractive to you. If you're looking for another version of the game to play, I'd personally recommend the Wii version due to the controls actually working pretty well if you're willing to put up with a bit of waggle during the QTEs (to those who argue that the more precise aiming ""throws off the balance"" and makes the game worse, all I have to say is we'll have to agree to disagree on that debate). Otherwise, pick up any of the other console versions that exist as I'm sure they're all just fine and dandy.\n\nJust don't pick up the original PC version. Just...don't do it.",Not Recommended
"Oh the nostalgia I get when playing this game.  I had it for Gamecube back in the day, and absolutely loved it.  It and Wind Waker were my two favorite games for the ol' GCN back in the day.  Playing this game just sends me right back to my room or my buddies house where we would stay up into the wee hours of the morning playing RE4.  Great times.\n\nThis remake (rather it's just a retexturing) to me stands Recommended to the original.  I will admit, it took me about an hour of gameplay to get back in the control scheme, as it is very different than any game now a days.  You have to think though, not many games rocked the 2-stick movement and aiming combo back then as pretty much all games do now.  I remember CoD 3 on PS2 being the first game I ever played with those ocntrols, and I loved it then and do today.  So, just take some time with the controls, eventually they'll start to feel more natural.  I cannot vouch for M+K control though, as i feel like this game is meant to be played with a controller and that's how I play it.\n\nOverall quality of the re-texture?  I think it looks pretty good honestl.  It's not mind-blowing by any means, but it's enough for me to not feel like I'm playing a 10 year old game.  It's certainly no Skyrim or modern day visualy appealing game.  Everything is very dark and gritty and I think these re-texture works with that fine.\n\nNow then, I'll get back to reliving my childhood here soon via this game.  If you liked the original, then I think you'll find everything you want in this game.",Recommended

"This is an absolute gem of a game that ports unbelievably well to the PC. Its smooth, fun and whats more, it actually improves upon some elements of the game. \n\nIf you haven't played it before, you're in for a treat. It is a survival horror game, but rather than a run and hide type game with limited weaponry, you are relatively well supplied. There is a bevvy of guns and, so long as you aren't a retard, enough ammo to go around. The challenge lies in the games aspect, easily allowing for enemies to sneak in behind. The panic and sense of doom exist as they do in other games, but if feels less like being a deer in the woods with hunters than it does feel like being a hunter hunting man. You can come out on top, but only if you really keep your wits about you, because a slip up can cost you dearly.\n\nThe controls can be a bit of a bitch to figure out at times, as they aren't particularly well documented. For instance, managing the case involves arrangement to accomodate all your stuff. However, it never tells you you can move stuff by using backspace to pick it up and pg down and del to flip it. Its a bit frustrating, but once you work through the kinks its a blast.\nContrarily, the control scheme for combat feels much more logical with the keyboard and mouse. I started playing with an xbox controller but gave it up to play with KB&M. \n\nIf you liked this game on the previous gen systems, you will love it here. I don't think I would say its worth 20 dollars, but if you can pick it up for 10 or less, its a wise investment.",Recommended

Leon is a likeable protagonist and the story does a good job of keeping you interested, but it's nothing world-shaking. Unless you're a resident-evil-veteran(or if you played this game as much as I did) there's always a sense of dredd and mystery about what's around the next corner. The guns and weapons are all very memorable and fun to experiment with.\n\nPositives:\n+solid mechanics\n+great leveldesign, fun bosses, interesting world that rewards exploration\n+Average playtime for a first try: 12-14 hours WITH added content like the mercenaries, Ada's assignment and other fun stuff to unlock\n\n\nNegatives:\n-Why the hell do I still have to beat game on normal before I can play on professional? This really annoyed me in previous ports/versions and I really hoped it would be fixed in this iteration/remake\n-Keyboard/mouse-controls are managable, but controller-use is still recommended/necessary for the best experience(in my opinion)\n-HD remake without adding any content to the ps2/wii-version. Would it have been so hard to add some behind the scenes/making off videos?\n\n\n",Recommended

"One of my favorite games of all time gets a lazy port. Since this game is almost ten years old I won't review it as a game, but solely as a port. \n\nMinor graphical upgrade at best. It looks more like an upconvert than an actual remake. There a few extra textures thrown in here and there but if you were hoping for a complete graphical overhaul you will be disappointed. Don't get me wrong, it is nice to play the game in 1080p 60 fps, but I expected more in 2014.\n\nThe gameplay is where the real disapointment comes in. Resident Evil 4 just doesn't play well on a mouse and keyboard, which was the main selling point for me. I was hoping this would control similar to the Wii version, and to an extend it does. Aiming with the mouse is smooth and accurate and superior to a controller (although still not quite as intuitive as a Wii remote). But moving your characters with the wasd keys never feels natural. At first I thought I just needed to adjust to it, because it had been so long since I had played the game, but after I plugged in my 360 controller, everything controlled the way I remember it on the gamecube. Now if your intention is to indeed play it with a controller than maybe this game is for you, but after playing it on the Wii, it feels like a step backward to use a traditional controller. Capcom should have updated the controls to modern conventions so that turning left and right doesn't feel so clunky and awkward using the keyboard. On top of that I couldn't figure out how to rearrange my inventory using the keyboard and I googled the problem and never found a solution. Rearranging your inventory with a controller is simple and easy. \n\nAnd then there are some sound issues when using 5.1 surround sound. Sometimes I cannot hear Leon walk over certain terrains. And sometimes when I opened a door there was no accompanying sound. I easily fixed this problem by reverting to stereo sound, but that's something I expect from the woefully inadequate sound settings in Deadly Premonition (still love that game), and not from a veteran video game designer like Capcom. Next time I hope Capcom takes a que from Nintendo on how to do a proper remake (Wind Waker anyone?). \n\nResident Evil 4 is not a bad game for the PC platform, but I was hoping for the definitive version considering this is 2014 and while it may be the best graphically speaking, I would rather play this game on my Wii, because of the superior controls. I do not recommend picking up the PC version unless you have never played it before, because outside of the minor graphical upgrade there is nothing new to see here. 6.5/10",Not Recommended

worst. already owned this on ps3 but i bought it again to take advantage of the mouse for shooting but it's so poorly optimised i've ended up using my 360 controller instead. the character can't straife using (a) and (d) and can't move at all when aiming. i know it's an old game but don't bother porting it to PC if it's going to be this bad.,Not Recommended

"This rushed port would have been acceptable if they at least had the courtesy to optimise the game to run at a decent speed. Aiming is atrocious thanks to the game converting mouse inputs into analogue x/y (controller inputs), leading to a ridiculous amount of negative mouse acceleration leaving me to fight with the controls. The Menus and general user interface remains almost untouched from its roots  yet  this is on a PC now, using wasd to manage my inventory is very tedious when I have a perfectly good mouse (added convenience from a mouse interface would be a grand selling point). However the greatest failure is the slowdown, the moment I walk into the opening village the game begins to dramatically chug as though Leon is walking on the surface of the moon, I look away from enemies and instantly the game pics up. This is unacceptable for a full released game costing £15 and renders the experience sickening (The option for 120 fps would be appreciated considering vice city had it back in 2003).\n\nIt’s still Resident Evil 4 and that fact is what truly makes this so heart breaking, I would love to be able to just play this game in all of its chainsaw fleeing monster freezing glory but seeing it in this state is truly pathetic.

If you want to know which version of Resident Evil is the WORST, it's the PS2 version or the original PC version (Again, the Steam version is not that PC version, this is a safe buy).\n\nAlso, keep an eye on this project; It shows a lot of promise. http://www.re4hd.com/",Recommended
"Probably one of my favorite Resident Evil games in the series along with 2. Amazing game, can be slightly laggy at times but worth your money. :)\n\nEDIT:\n\nSo I've played a lot of the game and as enjoyable as it should be. The one thing that kills it for me is the massive lag that should not exist to begin with. Lagging simply for having enemies in the area is terrible. There should be a patch to fix the slow down issue but given that this game was released on Steam a good while back I doubt the patch will ever happen.\n\nWhile I continue to love a majority of the game (playing with a controller is a good idea, I don't mind a slight change in controller setup for the PC) the main issue that ruins it for me is the lag. The lag goes as far as ruining entire cutscenes. Audio will play 6-10 seconds before the action in a cutscene happens. Also, in rarer cases, the game will lag so bad with cutscenes that the cutscene plays 10 frames per second for absolutely no reason and can cause some things to fail to load in a cutscene.\n\nIf it was not for the lag, I would absolutely love to recommend this to all my friends who want to play it.\n\nFinal EDIT:\n\nAppears lowering my FPS to 30 fixes some lag issues but I have to stop playing at the King's Grail room. The lag there becomes so terrible that it took around five minutes after I pressed the menu button for it to come up. Reading the forum as well, seems Capcom does not care in the slightest to fix lag issues despite plenty of complaints (even from a user like me who has all the right setting set up to make the game work as good as possible). No future patches to be expected, Resident Evil 4 - HD Lag Edition is a more fitting name. Cash grab indeed, poor play Capcom, poor play....",Not Recommended

"Resident evil 4 is one of those games that I have fond memories of playing when I was younger. In my opinion, this is the best out of all the Resident Evil games. Maybe it's the nostalgia, but I just can't stop playing it. \n\nThe first thing you need to realise, is that this game uses a 'tank' control scheme. What I mean by this is that you cant move while aiming your gun. You cannot side-strafe like in the 5th and 6th games, making it very awkward to play without a controller. That being said, the controls are as good as they can be on a keyboard and mouse, but I would still recommend using a gamepad.  I think these controls actual help the gameplay in several ways. First off, the game is in third person view, which obscures a lot of your view to begin with. Second, not being able to move or see at wide angles really helps the atmosphere. It makes you feel anxious in battles, especially when you know something is creeping up behind you. \n\nThe gameplay is challenging and fun, but it may seem a bit repetitive at times. You will battle many bosses throughout the game, but they will all have a different style to them. Some bosses will have you running around enclosed spaces, trying to avoid their attacks, while some others will have a mostly stationary boss that sends in minions and hits you with powerful slow attacks. There are many weapons you can unlock and buy, including a rocket launcher (which can be used to cheat through some of the harder bosses.) The inventory system is one of my favorites in any game. You have to fit all of your guns, ammo, grenades, rocket launchers, and herbs into one tiny briefcase by roatating and organzing each and every item. Just picking up items is a puzzle! \n\nThe graphics are nothing to write home about, and this particular port has bunch of framerate problems, but it isn't anything I would regret paying for. In the end, I would recommend this game over any other Resident evil game. \n\nAnd as a side note, the games' title is all lowercase letters in your steam library. This is a minor flaw, but when you have over 500 games like me, having only ONE lowercase steam title is irritating. Unfortunately, no amount of bitching will get this fixed, as it is a copyright problem.",Recommended
"OK, so I'm guessing you've heard about this game. How it's so important, it changed third-person shooters and survival horror forever, yada yada yada. But is it really still worth playing today?\n\nHell yes.\n\nAfter a disappointing experience with RE5, I had just assumed Resident Evil wasn't for me. I could not have been more wrong. This game is amazing. The combat still holds up. Although it might look boring since you can't move and shoot, it's actually one of the most intense games I've played. A single mistake can ruin everything, but you can always recover through a bit of luck and careful shooting. The AI isn't brilliant, but it's still really good, better than many modern games I could name.\n\nThe HD visuals look really nice. Each weapon is well balanced and serves it's own niche. There are a couple issues, of course. You need a big CPU if you want to run at 60 FPS, and not all the textures have been updated, leaving some rough patches in the scenery. And the cutscenes in Seperate Ways haven't been changed at all. The voice acting and plot are hilariously bad. But all in all, this game is incredibly fun. It's aged surprisingly well, and this edition puts an extra coat of polish on an already fantastic purchase. Even if you don't consider yourself a survival horror fan, you will probably enjoy this game.\n\nWhat are you waiting for? Buy it now!",Recommended

"(Quick verdict at the bottom)\nScore: 4/5\n\nResident Evil 4 is actually the fifth game in the main series, and definitely the most popular. Critics and gamers alike heap praise on this title like there's no tomorrow, and you can't blame them, because the game really is incredible. And although it's set some questionable trends, like the hideous and cheap quick-time event, or the genre shift from horror to action that it's successors unjustly receive criticism for, the game holds up incredibly well today. Thus it should be no surprise that it has been released on basically every platform in one way or another; this one is the second PC version. We're talking about [i]Capcom[/i] here, people! The master milkers! This review will be mostly a comparison between the original (abysmal) 2007 PC port and this re-release.\n\nGraphically, this game isn't a remake but an HD overhaul, so don't expect it to be amazing. The new textures look great in comparison to the old ones, but still kind of washed out and muddy. Animations are exactly the same, but no complaint there, as they're extremely fluid and, well, kick-ass. There's a new lighting engine and it looks good, but still not great. Far better than the original 2007 release though. There's also a variety of video options to tweak, which, while standard, weren't there for the original, so it's a nice addition. 60fps looks great if your PC can handle it, but the option to stay at 30fps is still there for lower-end machines. I've heard complaints about how the game runs, but I haven't run into anything major so far, so I assume they've patched a couple of things. Monster design is unique and some of the best in the series, for sure. Regeneradors/Iron Maidens still scare the piss out of me, and they look even worse now in HD. Menus are crisp and finally the cutscenes are in real-time, which is so much better than those eyesore FMVs in the 2007 version.\n\nSound-wise, it holds up well. Being the middle point for the series, the voice acting sort of follows suit; it's like halfway between a B-movie (from Resident Evil 1, 2, 3 and Code: Veronica) and a Hollywood blockbuster (Resident Evil 5, Revelations and 6). Still camp, but in a good way. Music is phenomenal, very appropriate and moody depending on your circumstance in the game. Enemies sound chilling (again, the Regeneradors scare the piss out of me) and just damn cool a lot of the time. The bosses especially provide some traditional Resident Evil-style mutations. I do have an issue here though; every now and then the game will just stop playing all sounds, only for them to all play at once after a couple of seconds. It doesn't happen often but it is kind of annoying nonetheless.\n\nStory: typical Resident Evil. As in, it's just all over the place and weird. Kind of a mixed bag. One thing I never liked about the plot in Resident Evil 4 is how radically different it is from its predecessors. [spoiler]If you ignore the fact that Wesker, Ada and references to Umbrella's downfall are in the game, it really doesn't have anything to do with previous entries.[/spoiler] It's pretty much entirely self-sufficient. The fact that the gameplay changes radically as well further alienates it from the earlier games. But the story has never really been a drawing point for me in this series, and it's not too complicated and gets the job done, despite some cliches here and there. Leon S. Kennedy, from Resident Evil 2, is tasked with rescuing the President's daughter, who's been kidnapped in rural Spain. He interacts with a cast of mostly interesting characters, there's a couple of plot twists, and there's some nice political stuff thrown in.\n\nThe gameplay is where this game shines, and it's easy to see why it's renowned as a classic and one of the best games of all time. Gone are the fixed camera angles, pre-rendered backgrounds, solving puzzles, zombies, and avoiding enemies. Resident Evil 4 is pure action, but this isn't a bad thing, because it's done so well. Setting the trend for basically all future third-person shooters, Resident Evil 4 is played in an over-the-shoulder view from Leon's perspective. Tank controls are far less restricting when the camera moves with you, and aiming is now free, allowing for precision, which you'll definitely need. Enemies react incredibly well depending on where you shoot them, or what type they are. No, you can't move and shoot, but you get used to it quickly (especially if you've played the earlier games).\n\nIn the place of zombies are Ganados (Spanish for ""cattle""), humans who have been injected with a parasite which makes them all hive-minded servants, hell-bent on slicing you open with a scythe, or rake, or hatchet, or kitchen knife, or chainsaw. Shoot them in the arm and they'll drop their weapon. Shoot them in the leg and they'll drop to their knees, allowing you to perform a crowd-clearing and oh-so-satisfying kick to the head. They're relentless, smart and they greatly outnumber you, and they're always getting stronger and more intelligent, which keeps them from being boring and keeps you on your toes. Their human qualities and behavior makes them all the more creepy too. And there's far more than just Ganados, too. There's tons of different enemies to kill, all requiring different tactics and weapons.\n\nWeapons are now acquired (mostly) from a travelling Merchant, who is simply the greatest Resident Evil character of all time. Not really, but he's cool. You can also upgrade weapons, find and sell treasures for more money. Your inventory is now an attache case with a grid-based spacing system, meaning items such as herbs take up a mere two slots, whereas rocket launchers take up a huge a mount of space. You can rotate items to allow for more space, or throw stuff away. Pretty much everything is upgradeable, and the sense of progression is really, really satisfying.\n\nResident Evil 4 is also perhaps the only game in existence to have an escort mission that is actually ENJOYABLE. For about half of the game you have to escort Ashley Graham, the President's daughter, to safety. If she dies or gets captured, Game Over. Thankfully, her AI is actually pretty good, and the fact that you can tell her to stop and hide rather than having to constantly be on the lookout makes the game much less of a hassle.\n\nIt controls well, although they definitely haven't aged as well as everything else. This port allows for much greater compatibility, either with a 360 controller or keyboard and mouse. Nothing astounding, but when you consider that the original 2007 release miraculously didn't have mouse support, it's a nice touch. And there's a slew of extras after completing the game. Tons of content to unlock, to keep you going. Sure, there isn't anything new in this version that you haven't seen since the original came out, but at least it's all there!\n\nIf there's one bad thing I can say about this release, it's the fact that it's basically a giant middle-finger to the awesome modding community of the original 2007 version. The people here: http://z6.invisionfree.com/Resident_Evil_4_PC/index.php?showforum=10 made what was one of the worst ports in history into one of the best through their hard work and dedication. I'm assuming Capcom either saw what they transformed this game into, or given that it's easier to port nowadays and that there's already a PS3/360 HD version available, decided that they'd just re-release it for some quick cash. However, there is a new modding community for the HD re-release, and if it picks up even a quarter as much as the original community, I'll be really impressed. After all, I did support Capcom and their money-grubbing ways by buying it again.\n\nVerdict: Buy it if you haven't played it before or in a long time. It's definitely the best version. Otherwise, stick with whatever release you currently have. There's nothing new here. But that ain't a bad thing!",Recommended

"Okay, so a little history. RE4 was originally released for Gamecube only. This was a time when Nintendo owned eclusive rights to sell Resident Evil games. It was AMAZING! The game had some amazing features for its time, and utilized all of the GC's special shaders and effects. Even on a fat old SD tv you felt SO there. Capcom saw the sucsess of RE4 and saw many PS2 gamers wanting to play it (Remember, Nintendo had exclusive rights, but only to the MAIN series. Spinoff titles like RE: Dead aim and RE: Outbreak could be released on the playstation, only if they stared no characters from the main series. These events are still cannon though)\n\nSo then came RE4 for PS2. Being port of the Gamecube version, things like those special shader effects for fog and textures just couldnt be emulated on the PS2 hardware. To make up for the lackluster visuals (and because it had already become a trend, even in the Resident Evil series) Capcom added costumes and weapons not previously availible to the Gamecube version. This pleased PS2 gamers, but as a young RE fanboy, i felt a bit cheated. I knew i had the superior verson, but you couldn't convince ANYONE there was a difference between the two versions visual quality and atmosphere.\n\nThere was also an iPhone version....and my eyes bled just looking at it.....the iPad version was even worse!\n\nThen Nintendo had launched a new console, the Wii (or if you ar as stuck in 2005 as i am, the Reveloution, which in many ways it was) and rumors of a motion-controlled version of RE4 began to circulate. Naturally i was pumped. I owned a Wii (and many of its dissapointing titles) and couldnt wait to see RE4 in full glory, on nintendo hardware....problem.\nSee the gamecube was a BEAST it could go toe to toe with both of its competitors (the Xbox had nearly double the CPU clock and double the graphics chip speed, than the GC. PS2 was slower than the GC at both, but made up for it with almost 9 times the storage per disc). The Wii however, well it abandoned the specialized things that made the Gamecube special. In short, once again a straight Gamcube port of RE4 was impossible. So they used the PS2 version, which could easily be moddified since it didnt have any of those special things either. What we were eft with is an ugly (albeit, fun) version of a once visually stunning game.\n\nFastforward, the 15th Anniversary of Resident Evil, its announced that HD versions of RE4 and RE: Code Veronica X were coming to PS3 and 360! I was PUUUUMPED! I decided on the PS3 version, since the D-pad is far superior. However HD is a very, VERY loose term for the way these games looked. Code veronica looked okay, but really much like the RE4 GC version, the Dreamcast version of CV will always be superior. RE4...well they just took the Wii version, ported it back to PS3 and Xbox 360. \n\nYou might be asking; ""What's your point? All youve done is complain about the GC and preached how it was better than sliced bread. It isnt!"" Fair enough, but my point is this. Have you ever had to photocopy a photocopy? I have. Back in school, music teachers would Xerox sheet music to save funds. Sometimes the last copy, would itself be a photocopy of the original. Then you would have to Xerox that Xeroxed page , resulting in a 2nd generation batch of copies. By the third or fourth time, the image had degraded to the point where certian notes or staffs of the music would be illegible. I believe the same thing applies here. \n\nEvery time this game gets ported, the quality degrades. So don't expect a Recommended HD version of RE4....ever! It would require a complete rebuild of all maps and textures. This is more work than Capcom wants to waste on a catalog game. If you want my advice? Emulate the Gamecube version. The Dolphin emulator has options to display a game at much larger native resolutions. Is it complicated? Yeah, but i dont think any of you will know just how good the Gamecube was, and why RE4 was MEANT to be played on that system. Or maybe you will call me a jackass. Either way, i hope you now know a bit more about RE4 and its post-release history. For more info, or to tell me i messed up some random fact i spewed, message me.\n\nBottom line, it IS still RE4, and it contains all the bonus content from all ports of the game. I am glad it has been digitally preserved, but i SOOO wish HD meant ""All New Textures, with original GC fog effects and bumpmaps"" but it aint gonna happen. Buy it!\n\n",Recommended

"After the abysmal port that was the PC version of RE4, this new release is fantastic. Customizable keyboard controls as well as controller support with both 'classic' and 'modern' sensitivity modes make the gameplay easy for veterans and newcomers. Constant patches from the devs keep the game improving, and the updated HD looks incredible. This game merges shooting tons of enemies with a huge amount of unlockables. No DLC here; all the content is in the game already, waiting to be unlocked. This game was and still is the prime example of a good video game: great gameplay and great replayability. Buy this if you've beaten it 15 times on previous versions like myself, or if you have never played it before. It will reinvent what you think a video game should be like.",Recommended
ten outta ten JUST for the reloading animations. one of my favolrite games ever!,Recommended
"Resident Evil 4 is one of the greatest games ever made.  It rejuvenated the series as it was slowly becoming stagnant.  RE4 didn't kill the series because it was bad but rather because it was so good any further sequel would be worse no matter what.  It's a flawless mix of survival, horror, action, a pinch of puzzle solving and a huge amount of camp.  I love that this game doesn't take itself seriously like 99% of games these days.  RE4 practically invented the set piece action sequences seen in most modern games but it also features plenty of ""meat n' potatoes"" gameplay in between the set pieces.  The environments are incredibly varied and it's simply a blast from beginning to end.  Perhaps controversial are the QTE's.  While I don't particularly enjoy QTE's I can appreciate their usage in RE4 for heightening tension and not going overboard with them as some games do.  I could go on and on, but these are all points shared across all versions of the game.  The most important thing this PC re-release provides is mostly functional 60fps support.  Playing this at 60fps is a revelation; there is absolutely no going back.  It's so much easier on the eyes and plays much better.  Aiming is smoother, even with a controller.  I've been gaming on a 120hz monitor for a few years now and even though the game is capped at 60fps it feels smoother than most games do at 60fps.  I think because the animations are keyed to the framerate is why it appears this way.  For example, Wolfenstein: TNO feels downright choppy at 60fps whereas this is absolutely butter smooth.  Mouse and keyboard support is present but not quite as good as I'd hoped for.  The mouse is a tad wonky even with the ""modern"" aim setting.  It feels like there is a slight amount of dampening but at least it seems as though the negative acceleration is gone.  It supports key rebinding but the defaults were just fine IMO.  Overall, M+KB is definitely usable but not necessarily ideal.  For a game like this, it really was intended to be played with a controller and it plays very well with a 360 pad.  If you're a huge fan of RE4 like myself, you need this version for the 60fps alone.  Sure it has some minor bugs and glitches but it's still by far the very best vanilla version of RE4 available and it'll only get better with further modding.  I wish this had had a higher budget internally at Capcom.  I'd gladly have paid a full $60 for a flawless re-release of RE4 with a more moderate graphical overhaul, perfect M+KB controls, no bugs or quirks, etc.  RE4 really deserves better than these budget re-releases Capcom's been doing, but overall it's hard to complain.  This release feels 90% finished for $20 which is still much, much, much better than the craptastic Sourcenext original PC release.",Recommended

"Lots to say about this masterpiece. First of all Resident Evil 4 is personally ranked as my #2 favorite game of all time. It is also my favorite Last Gen game. I have beaten the game more than 10 times due to its high replayibility and unlocks. I have played the game on gamecube when it first came out around 2004ish, then on my Wii, xbox 360 HD edition, and finally the Ultimate HD PC Edition. I am here to say without a doubt that the PC port is the best version of them all for many reasons. The HD remake is absolutely gorgeous and feels very smooth with its 60FPS option. For a game that has been out for a decade now it still makes some current gen games look older. Not only are the graphics good, but the gameplay is what makes this game such a gem. Its original third person over the shoulder combat style aiming revolutionized the third person gaming world today. This is the kind of game that gets better the more you progress, making replaying on higher difficulties worth it for its rewards. You play as Leon S. Kennedy who is a familiar Resident Evil Character first seen in Resident Evil 2. A ton of other characters make small cameos that I do not want to spoil. You are tasked with finding and rescuing the President's daughter, Ashley Graham, from a group of cult like crazies called Los Illuminados. Without giving away too much, the game follows that story pretty well. \n\nAside from Story Mode, the player can then play a mode called the Mercenaries and other game modes that open up a new character's storyline. All in all there is TONS of stuff to do in Resident Evil 4 and with only 25ish hours in I still have stuff to do in this game. Like I said earlier, I have played this game numerous times and still to this day I enjoy every bit of it. Fantastic masterpiece of a game - 10/10 Masterful",Recommended

Moving on to the actuall gameplay it is just as great as I remeber it playing on the GameCube , great levels , cool enemies , and great action mixed in with a little survival horror elements. great game a must buy for pc owners",Recommended

"The fact that this game has been ported a ""god knows how many"" time hasn't changed my opinion of it one bit. When it first hatched in 2004, I've spent a straight 10-hours grinding at it and a few (dozen) more playing it again and again and again, simply because I love it and its so enjoyable.\n\nThe graphics are a big step up from the Wii version, which was already so good I could not put the controller down, but for first-time launchers on the PC, it really needs some simplifications. Some people, like me, had to fiddle with the options menu for 10 minutes just because Leon refused to move faster than slow-motion. In fact, the game isn't friendly with high-end players at all, and the grapple breaking controls are not very good, I had to plug in an external controller for the sole purpose of shaking. The obvious fact that the strict, unchangeable control schemes for controllers have really frustrated me at times, and what is it good for if Subtitles, while cannot be toggled ""On"", has its own respective corner in the Options menu?\n\nBut putting all things aside, this game is still one of the best ports/remakes I've ever played. My $19.99 have not gone to waste on this bet I've made and, after all reconfigs and settings are over, it really is something to kick back and relax every now and then.\n\n9/10",Recommended

The story is well written character`s conversations are very interesting to watch, and trust me you will be looking for lore as to how this land became to be because this game does collectable notes GOOD.\n\nNow combat goes like this: Each part of the infected has its own hit box and animation, And trust me knowing what each hitbox does and when to use them is VITAL to your survival. Because trust me you cant plow through the game relying on headshots only. Because yes this does to the most damage (via gun) but your ammo will swiftly run out and that isnt going to help slowing down the horde coming towards you. Oh yeah and by the way your aimer is a laser and you cant move while shooting.\n\nNow this game is a giant escort quest but WAIT. It isnt as bad as you think, Ashley can take damage and in most games that sucks arse but here her AI is pretty well done. \n\n-If you shoot while she is beside you she will always hide behind your back and will move away from gunfire when you go to turn around.\n-If she is within the line of fire she will crouch down allowing you to shoot at your enemies clearly\n-she follows you around without a hicup and if you dont want to deal with her you can always tell her to wait or hide her in a container which will essentially render her invisable to the infected.\n\nAfter the amazing combat you have the large sprawling open ended levels and trust me they are a joy to explore, My favorite being the village not to mention you are rewarded for exploring by finding extra ammo, cash, treasure and the very interesting back story notes. Trust me for those who exclusivly buy open world games get this because its easy to call this game map an open world.

"Steam's UHD Version of Resident Evil 4 was ported to PC from the XBox 360 version.\n\nNot going to talk about the game itself because you know it very well. I'll just make some comments on the UHD version for Steam, in case your thinking to buy it:\n\n\n[b]1 - HD Textures[/b]\n\nThe Village textures looks pretty much HD, but we can´t say the same for the rest of the game.\n\nSome ""Casstle"" textures (just a few) and a lot of textures from ""The Island"" chapter, look like the SD versions. Besides, weapon's textures are pretty awfull (that's what bothers me most :P).\n\n\n[b]2 - 60 Fps[/b]\n\nSome animations (like rifle and bowgun reloads) were not ported to 60fps. Also some animations like ganado's exploding heads, etc.\n\nSometimes, 60 fps brake the game (it's VERY RARE tough). Sometimes it makes enemies run in circles and stuff like that.\n\nFalling objects drop at double speed (U3's cages, spinels, etc). This is a minor detail, but it's not very neat.\n\nBesides all the ""downsides"", playing the game in 60 fps is awesome. And a Feature of this version only.\n\n\n[b]3 - Mouse & Keyboard support.[/b]\n\nAfter 6 game patches, controls work great.\n\n\n[b]4 - Vissual FX[/b]\n\nNothing to critisize in this aspect. Altough the GC version is still superior (DOF, multiple screen filters, etc), the UHD port is VERY decent (everything important was included).\n\n\n[b]5 - Real Time cutscenes[/b]\n\nCutscenes are real-time, except the ones of ""Separate Ways"" mode and ""ESPECIAL 2"" custome in the main campaing (since this costume wasn't included in the GC version of the game).\n\n\n[b]6 - System requirements[/b]\n\nThey are quite HIGH for a 10 year old game. I own a Phenom II X4 955 with a HD Radeon 6870, and I have to disable AA in order to run the game at 60 fps and 1080p.\n\nAlso played it at 60 fps 800x600 on a Nvidia 8600GT videocard.\n\n\n[b]Conclusion?[/b]\n\nVery good port (FAR better than the 2007 one) but it still needs polish. Not better than the GC, but pretty close, with the addition of HD textures (65% of them), 60 fps, and of course: the K&M support (this alone makes it worth for any PC user)\n\nThe game is super FUN.\n\nHope my review will be usefull to you.\n\nRegards.",Recommended

I can't explain why a game that runs at 1080p/60fps on a powerPC Xbox 360 machine runs like crap on a PC - obviously it's the advanced FXAA and such - but it's pretty ridiculous. Any time the particle effects become intense on the screen (So, basically, the entire last half of the game when you are being shot constantly and things are always exploding) your frame rate is going to drop into the single dgits. Better yet, the game doesn't even look noticeably better on PC at max graphics than it does on console. Other than that there are some occasional, weird glitches where if you use a controller, it will occasionally display the QTE prompt using the keyboard bindings instead of the controller, but that's the only technical problem I ever encountered. It also lacks the option to adjust your controller sensitivity, but that isn't a major problem that will stop you from beating the game.\n\nNow, with a GTX1080, the game runs fine on ultra. But don't try to run this game off a USB 3.1 drive, and definitely don't do so with the Ultimate HD mod, or you're going to get massive frame drops, almost all the time.\n\nAs far as the game, it's RE4. Same stuff that was all in the PS2 port except it actually looks like it was meant to, like GameCube.You know, remember the PS2 port, and the original PC port by Ubisoft - el terriblay). Unfortunately, that isn't saying much because if you actually look at the resolution of the textures vs the original, they still look terrible. The only way to enjoy this game, graphically, is to use the HD mod which is still in progress and only covers about 50% of the game right now.\n\n RE4 ultimate edition comes with a PDF artbook and a 2 disc soundtrack, inherent controller support and the same achievements found on the console release. You can use XB1 controller, PS4, XB360, and USB controllers from what I've tested.\n\nIf you're a collector or completionist, I'd get this game, but just make sure your machine can run it.",Recommended

"What i can say about this RE game.....hmmm. Its not bad but also is not a survival horror like the old ones. But still have some of this little taste of ""survival horror"" (compared with 5 and 6, RE4 still have many factors that make this game a ""little"" survival). \n\nOther good point of view about this game is that now you can play it at 60 FPS (the old one was only playable at 30 FPS). So, is much better for your eyes (the human eyes can only see 60 frames per second. More FPS is nonsense)\nAlso, it have HD resolution, some post-procesing effects (light) and new textures.\n\nI really recomend this game. For 2 reasons: Is one of the newest RE games that keep that survival horror taste. And second, becouse i am a big fan of this saga (attention, not confuse with a fan boy :))",Recommended

"An amazing game on it's original release and it's stood the test of time!\n\nResident Evil 4 broke the mould for the series, moving away from tank controls, pre rendered backgrounds and fixed camera angles, going with an over the shoulder action camera, with a mostly real time environment.\n\nNo prior knowledge of the series to date is required to enjoy this game, but, if you have played the previous entries in the series you will get more enjoyment when certain names and events are mentioned.\n\nThis game is a great entry point in to the RE series - with several unlockable costumes and game modes upon completion, this game will last you a good while.\n",Recommended
this game sucks..dont bother,Not Recommended
"Even though it's been years since the original came out, RE4 is still just as fresh, scary, and replayable as it was on consoles.  It will take a bit to get used to the controls and if you have a controller I would recommend using it, but do not let that deter you from picking up this classic.",Recommended
"Resident Evil 4,\nor,\nEvery Time a Parasite Pops a Gamer Screams in Rage\nReview by Nikolas Dennis\n\n     Resident Evil 4 is a game that’s been out for almost ten years now. Originally published in 2005 for the GameCube, Capcom has released an HD Ultimate Edition for the PC. This game’s screenshots in old video game magazines were something of nightmare fodder for me, so, me being my older self that actually enjoys horror, I decided to pick it up. It would be a great chance to see where some of my other favorite games got their inspiration, such as the Dead Space series. So here’s what I’ve learned in two playthroughs of the game, not touching on the additional Ada Wong missions.\n	Capcom’s Resident Evil 4 is a third person survival horror shooter where your goal is to rescue the president’s daughter from being held captive in a small rural village in Spain. You do this as one Leon S. Kennedy, a survivor from the original Raccoon City outbreak in the Arklay Mountains who shortly after those events was recruited by the president as part of his special protection squad. Nobody knows why Ashley Graham, the aforementioned daughter, has been kidnapped, but it’s all up to Leon to get her out. Shortly after reaching the outskirts of the village Leon finds himself in a situation that can only be described as more than he bargained for. Facing hordes of “Los Ganados,” parasite infested villagers and believers in the cult behind the kidnapping known only as “Los Illuminados,” Leon will have to face the organic monstrosities with Ashley by his side, avoiding traps set by the leader of the cult, one Ossman Saddler, and his subordinates. Armed with only a pistol and a shotgun at the beginning, players will need to use carefully placed shots and quick reflexes if they want to make it back to the states alive and parasite free.\n	One of the first things you will notice about RE4 is the fixed camera angles, specifically the fact that there are none. That was a defining characteristic of past entries to help push claustrophobia and the fact that you were in an environment that was out to get you. You have to stay still while take aim and line up your shots, but there is a run button and a quick turn functionality that makes the environments easily maneuverable. This doesn’t take away from the horror aspect, as the hatchet and sometimes dynamite wielding villagers will lumber after you no matter where you go, forcing you to climb or dig out of your encampment as to not get overwhelmed. You cannot move while you are taking aim, a feature that adds new strategy into how you will clear rooms, serving as a balance to your newly gifted degrees of motion. The quick turn and draw is something that will save your life over and over again as you outmaneuver slashing chainsaws, swinging axes, and whip slashing parasites.\n	The controls in the game are very tight, very one to one, and the game is fantastic at providing feedback for everything you do and everything you should have done. Split second quicktime events and knowing when to reload is what draws the line between life and death, and the game always gives you knowledge when something like lasers are going to shoot out of a wall or if your clip is empty. Interpreting all this hectic information is incredibly possible, but it takes some practice. The fair checkpointing and spaced save points all make it so any mistakes resulting in death don’t set you too far back, but they also show you exactly what you did wrong so you can learn from it and evolve the concepts you’ve learned to adapt them to the next room or upcoming boss.\n	Running through all the different environments, you’re going to be picking up a lot of items to help keep you and Ashley alive, from ammo to health replenishing herbs to grenades. The place you’ll be storing all of them is in your trusty attache case. Each item you possess takes up a certain number of slots in the case, and you need to arrange them all so they fit nicely. It gets down to a point where you’ll be playing tetris with your inventory screen, but there are case upgrades spaced throughout the game to give you more room and, as a result, you’ll be spending less time organizing your inventory. Except for the treasures, though, and all the keys you get. Leon has pockets for days for things like collectible bottle caps and forgotten treasures like solid gold lynxes and butterfly lamps.\n	The three different environments you will go through and their sub environments all have unique enemies that you will have to deal with. The enemies are tailored to the space they are fighting in, so prepare to feel outmatched and outgunned; you’re not the one with the home field advantage here. Instead of zombies, it is Las Plagas that you will be fighting, villagers and cultists with a fully grown, insectoid parasite attached to their nervous system. Remember how headshots put zombies down? Not with these guys. Once you hear the *pop* that comes with their head exploding, you’ll have to wait a few seconds for a second one or rather hoping you won’t hear a second one, indicating that the parasite has sprung up through their neck and now has more health than the beginning enemy and can rinse you in one hit.\n	Resident Evil 4 is a game filled with verbose villains and naive heroes, with the latter trying to figure out why they’ve been thrown into this maze of horrors and the former having fun poking at the newest members that have fallen into their trap. The villains are grandiose and verbose, just as their plans are, and serve as great motivation to keep going in the story in the hopes to get them to shut up, or wipe the smiles off of their smug faces. It’s a game where the tiniest mistake can have you writhing in agony as you try to complete a section for the fourth time over but keep getting stuck on those guys with the damn catapults! It’s a game that has endless replayability because of how fun it is and tacked on are things like bonus costumes and hidden weapons only unlocked after beating the game. It’s a most enjoyable on again/off again escort mission filled not with zombies but something that will satisfy that zed hunting itch if you have it. And don’t forget: Pack that sweet herb, you’ll need it.",Recommended
"This game has kept my attention and entertained me since the PlayStation 2 version. The HD Graphics make it look better, but the gameplay didn't need to be rebuilt because it's so great.. This is one of the times nostalgia won't screw you over..",Recommended
"A masterpiece in general, Residnt Evil 4 has everything anyone could ever want from a survival horror game. The game basically puts you in the shoes of government agent Leon S. Kennedy who is sent out on a mission to retrieve the president's missing daughter, but stumbles on something more dangerous than what he originally thought. For $19.99, you get a lot out of this game. You get an amazing story that is well worth your time, additional modes to play with after you beat the game, a great combat system with unpredictable enemies, and some fairly challenging boss battles that should keep you busy for a while. In general, Resident Evil 4 / Biohazard 4 is one of the best video games I have ever played in my life, and I'd recommend it to anyone who likes horror. \n\nThe Verdict: 10/10 Definetly one of my favorite games of all time. One of a kind, and cannot be redone.",Recommended
"Played this game on the Playstation 2 and was blown away, played the HD version on Playstation 3 and still loved it, and the PC port is no different. With the introduction of 60fps and another visual upgrade, this game is a must buy if you loved the original! However i would recommend using a controller, the keyboard and mouse are very hard to move and shoot with. Overall 9/10.",Recommended
"One of my favorite vidya games from my past as well as, in my opinion, one of the best games ever made.. it revamped the entire RE series as well as laid very efficient groundwork for future games to use..

"Oh the nostalgia! But let me be quite honest in this review, Resident Evil 4 is a game that revolutionized survival horror and will provide you with hours of fun. If I may dare to make an analogy, the average price for a movie ticket to a 2 hour showtime at night is about 15 USD, and if you want concessions add about 20 USD on top of that. Add together the 2 hours of entertainment, 3 hours for the quality of the entertainment, and 5 hours if you went with friends or family or someone special and continued the night after the movie. That's a wopping 10 hours of cummulative entertainment. At the time of this review I have logged 33 hours on this game for a total price of 20 USD. \n\nIf you have never played RE4 before, buying this game would be treating yourself to hours of entertainment in the survival horror genre. If you played this game on Gamecube or PS2, or even the older 2007 ""revamped"" PC format (I'm dreadfully sorry if you did because you practically wasted your money if you weren't involved in the modding community) than this new HD version won't exactly blow your mind; but, there is still major benefit to purchasing the game. The HD textures are very much noticeable during combat and overall gameplay. The characters look amazing, the explosions and bullets look wonderful, and the merchant's blue torches have never looked creepier. The updated smoothness to your FPS makes movements and actions seamless and much more realistic. \n\nI really have enjoyed this game thoroughly and have no doubts in my mind that I will continue to play despite clearing the main campaign three times so far and the subcampaigns once each. I highly recommend purchasing Resident Evil 4 to anyone who is a fan of the survival horror genre.",Recommended
"It was a very good game, but slow, I'd like a normal speed, and there is going to be very slow. the question arose as to whether the slow podcasts.

"Resident Evil 4 was one of the greatest survival horror games of the Gamecube and PS2 era, and still greatly holds up to this day.\nWithout going into too much detail, it's your standard good vs. evil story line, with a few twists and turns along the way.\nThat being said, there were no real plot twists that really left my jaw on the floor.\nBut most people, including myself, don't play the Resident Evil games for the story. We play it for the fun, survival horror style elements , and decent gunplay. The lack of moving and aiming certainly feels dated, but this revolutionized the over the shoulder Third Person shooter. As I said, the game feels dated, but the new HD makeover looks pretty good.\nFinally, we have a Resident Evil game that runs at a constant 60 FPS, and it looks very fluid. That being said the framerate drops for some reason when reloading any sniper rifle. Note: You will need a pretty powerful PC to run this game on max settings.\nThe dated feel and tank controls may turn off some ""newer"" gamers, but by itself, it still remains to be one of the greatest survival horror games in existence , and should be checked out by any fans of the the Resident Evil series, or survivial horror fans who missed it when it first came out.\n8.5/10\n",Recommended
HEY! if you do not have a Nivida Graphics card Not even worth buying! because it only works for that type of graphics card. If you do buy it with a Radeon (Which is what i got) You will suffer from lovely Desyncing issues and Countious slowmontion.\n\nHonestly What was the point of making a port if only one kind of brand which i know so far can work for this game.

"Resident Evil 4 is a classic!  I was stoked to find out that there is a third control option for the xbox controller on this pc version, allowing the player to aim with the right joystick.  One of the best games i have ever played for sure.  Note that this game is very difficult and is hard to get good at.  Only one problem, which is with my computer compatability, gameplay becomes slow when looking at a large waterfall or something else that takes a lot of programing.",Recommended
"A fine port. Runs perfect on my computer at 60fps with no slow down like other people are saying they get. I play with the M&K because I have no controller and even though I find playing with a controller more comfortable, the M&K controls are fine except for the quicktime events (I found it difficult to react quickly enough to press the X and C keys at the same time) and the controls for organising your inventory are a bit weird. \n\nI've completed it three times already and I'm now trying to beat professional difficulty. It's one of my favourite games of all time and you should play it if you haven't already.  Just be wary of the spec requirements as apparently people get slowdown and stuff.",Recommended

"This game is awesome! RE4 is my favourite game of all time.\nYes, the controls are a little clunky, you can't strafe and you have to stand still to shoot, but each of these factors add to the tension of the game. They make things a little uncomfortable and a little more dangerous... (In a lesser game, no strafe movements and having to be still to shoot would be deal-breakers for me, but I got the hang of them quite quickly and haven't really missed them at all).\nRE4 has fantastic atmosphere, challenging bosses and even the QTEs aren't nearly as frustrating as most other games I have played. \nI was initially concerned about having to babysit an AI character (Ashley) and though (in a few of my other-console playthroughs) she caused me to die more than a few times, her presence added to the 'danger' of the game. (I know a lot of players hated Ashley, but I thought she could be fun to protect).\nSo whether you play this on one of many consoles, I recommend it! Give it a shot!",Recommended
"I highly reccomend this game, regardless of your pc settings. If you can't run the game with that many frames per second, you can always lower the settings (I was too derpy and probably angry about something else at the time when I first wrote this review.) Anyways, the story is full of cheese, the dialog can be silly too (maybe not as much as with the predecessing games), and they (the enemies) aren't zombies. Another thing is that this might be a good one to try, if the earlier Resident Evil games were too hard for you. In this one, have no fear of losing ammunition as you'll always find it on every other enemy. Never fear for limited saves, IT'S UNLIMITED :O. Seriously though, this game is cake. With enough practice, you'll be saying you're a resident evil god, and then you'll cry in a corner when you fail at Resident Evil 0-3 (Code Veronica Included).\n\n\nStuff below is mostly my bitching from a transition of how I first played Resident evil four.\n\n\nI'd actually recommend the Wii Edition. I've played the pc, Xbox 360, and Wii versions. To my surprise, the one that I keep returning to is the Wii version. The ability to actually see where I was aiming was the greatest strong suit. Graphics for the game (though a stupid gimmick) were outstanding for its time. The replay ability was due to the multiple unlockable weapons. With the Wii version, the character is able to quick knife with the shake of the Wii remote. The problem with other versions involved the impossible task of being able to aim. One con of the game though has been the voice acting. Just listen to the preview. With the Wii, I felt like I was in the game. There were creatures that were actually terrifying, one such is called the reanimator, it was difficult to kill, made eerie noises and even had its own song. I would reccomend this game only if you have a Wii. If you disagree, then you must understand. You're wrong. The laser sight is barely visible, Leon's shaky hands don't help either when combined with the barely visible sights. Another faulty thing is the controls for Leon. It takes a lot of time to correctly move without accidently turning around and the camera may work against him.",Recommended

"don't buy this crap! I thought with the HD remake that you could control the gun with the mouse instead of what capcom/UBISOFT did in the original boxed pc version of the game where there was no mouse control and all was controlled by the keyboard. All they did was allow you to do with the mouse is move the camera around (not a head or gun camera like re5 and re6, more like a free floating camera) which screws you up if you are used to the mouse being head/gun control like re5 and re6.",Not Recommended
Very akward to control. I fight the controls more than the enemies.,Not Recommended
"I was actually shocked to see this announced. With a terrible and hopeless port of RE4 being released years ago, I thought this'd never become a reality. I squealed like a weeaboo teenage girl when I saw the pre-orders in the steam updates popup.\n\nUpon release my heart was broken, as was the game itself. The aiming went all over the place and made the act of playing the game stressful as all hell, and I'd realised that I'd given all my hopes up for something that was probably asking too much in the first place. There would be no perfect edition of Resident Evil 4. Such is life, such is the way of porting games from nearly ten years ago...\n\nBut then, to my surprise, they came out with a patch not a week later. A new aiming mode? All the aiming issues are fixed in both modes, you say? I was so genuinely surprised that in one simple patch they managed to fix every single issue I encountered. Pure ecstasy, and all my friends who were put off in the beginning were once again interested. But then I started encountering new issues with the game, for instance 'struggle' QTEs were hard as balls to pull off like I could in the console versions. Suddenly, here come the beta patches. Pretty much any issue I encounter gets targeted and I'm very grateful for that.\n\nHonestly, I'm sat here still letting it sink in that one of my favourite games got a successful makeover for current operating systems. The game looks and feels fantastic at high resolutions and framerates, although I had to turn motion blur off because it's not the best kind of blur. Only thing I could say is that I'm disappointed that it doesn't have the crosshair aiming system from the PC version of Resident Evil 5, especially since that functionality was in the Wii edition, but you can easily look past that and in the end it's still easily the best version of RE4 on the market today. \n\nThank you Capcom! This is easily the happiest I've been with a release in a long time. And I hope you continue to support this game and hopefully allow some form of modding community access to the game, just to keep breathing life into it.",Recommended
"Why did I get this game? For some reason, the frames are sooooo bad! And it's not like my computer is crappy, I can play Resident Evil Revelations without any problems.

The eyes are defined to where you can really see emotion through them (Which in my opinion makes the game so much more real), the water, blood, trees, wind, everything is so much more improved. There are a few issues here and there that will need patches to clean up but they are VERY minor. Resident Evil 4 is still an amazing game and worth the buy. HOWEVER if you are having slow motion problems, go to the main menu and lower your FPS from 60 to 30. Just a minor problem that shouldn't impact your gaming experience. Hopefully there will be a patch coming out to fix it but for now that's all you can do. I hope this helps and game on!",Recommended

"“what are you buying?... what are you selling?.. is that all stranger?, he he he…. is that all stranger?, he he he… is that all stranger?… is that all stranger?… is that all stranger?… is that all stranger?… heh he he, thank you.”\n\nAh… I never thought I’d hear those words again from our friend the Merchant. Coming back from an eight year Resident Evil hiatus and playing this game again was a refreshing treat. I will also say that I enjoyed it on the PC much more than PS2 or even Game Cube. I really liked the direction Resident Evil 4 shifted towards… and not just because I liked Ashley Graham’s jugs. I’ll admit that it was a big adjustment getting used to RE4 at first. When the game was first released back in 2005, I was whining and crapping out bricks when I got my pre-order copy on Game Cube and played it for the first time. I was upset because it didn’t have any zombies, and I didn’t think that the old men with rakes and pitchforks at the beginning were very menacing foes. But playing further into the game and encountering some of the tougher enemies and intimidating bosses along with the really captivating level designs… this game turned out to be a real gem and became my favorite of the RE series. I even liked it more than Code Veronica X where I was obsessed with Claire Redfield’s jugs… and then before that where I fantasized over Jill Valentine’s awesome jugs… a rack worthy of resting my joystick on / or I should say in between. Sorry, I got lost in the moment thinking about all those gorgeous jugs and giving Jill Valentine a pearl necklace with extra Big Mac sauce… anyway back to my review. I have not Played RE 5 or RE 6, but if they are half as good as RE 4; then they will be well worth playing. I’m really down for playing RE 6; that Helena Harper is one fine piece of ass and she has got a phenomenal pair of jugs – and Juggerdan likes his jugs. Seriously though… Resident Evil 4 has got my seal of approval at 10/10. Get this game if you haven’t played it, or missed it to play the newer ones… It’s a classic. Oh and just in case I forgot to mention, that Ashley Graham has got a fine pair of jugs! :) \n",Recommended

"Keep in mind that this game is the first Resident Evil game I've played.  Ever.\n\nI can't speak for how different this game is from the past instalments.  However, this game is fantastic and I find that it's succesfully managed to get me hooked on the entire franchise; I'm a picky bastard when it comes to the games I like/craft the badges for nowadays, but I just had to do it for this game.  It's fun, satisfying and well worth the money I payed for it.\n\nThe story is summed up like this; Leon S. Kennedy is sent to a rural Spanish village, where it is most likely the President's kidnapped daughter will be.  As you can expect, things go wrong [i]very quickly[/i] and Leon is forced to fight his way to the President's daughter and fight his way out.  Not completely original but still not executed poorly; whatever story was there was enjoyable to follow and I feel like it increased how much I liked the game.\n\nAnybody who is accustomed to modern third-person shooter controls will find these ones stiff at first; you can't run and shoot, you can't run and reload, you basically can't run while on the offensive.  That being said, this feature makes Leon feel more helpless, making the atmosphere and the environment of the village-gone-wrong even more effective.  Going up against a mob of people and being forced to run away so you can regain your composure and reload is something that is key to the game and I actually think it's a good idea it's there.\n\nA problem that I faced, however, was a good amount of framerate issues.  At first these really weren't that prominent; however, when you get later in the game this just seems to get far worse than before.  Since I was already hooked on the game I didn't quit after this, nor did I find it to be a gamebreaking issue, but it still really affected how immersed I was with it.  I'm not sure that this will be fixed entirely; this is a Capcom game and to be truthful they aren't exactly amazing with their fan service (GFWL not being removed from most of their games, apparently ruining this franchise with Resident Evil 6 and Raccoon City, DLC that's completed and on the disc yet still charging customers extra for it, managing to bury my favourite Mega Man spin-off franchise).  That being said however, it isn't a MAJOR MAJOR issue and you could easily look past it with how much you're getting.\n\nTo sum it up, I had and am still having a lot of fun.  Pretty much at the last parts of the game at this point and I hope that the ending will be a satisfying touch to an already great game.  I think Capcom really did justice to this instalment.",Recommended
"Old but very good, this game is one of my favorites.\n\nO Resident Evil 4 PC antigamente tinha em tamanho aproximadamente 4G, este aqui está com 9.1G, é mais que o dobro em tamanho para tão pouca diferença em qualidade.\nEstou jogando ele em 1920x1080, com texturas e anti-aliasing bem altos e pouca coisa muda. Aliás, muita coisa continua com as texturas antigas, como solo e alguns detalhes.\nAlguns locais o solo está melhor, porém na maioria das vezes, é a textura antiga.\nO Jogo está muito pesadão, tenho um PC gamer muito bom, porém ele está sofrendo para rodar este RE4, acredito que usaram muitas firulas para conseguir pouco resultado melhor.\nRecomendo aguardar o RE4 entrar em alguma promoção no Steam, pois R$39,90 hoje 26/04/2014, acredito que não vale.\nO jogo em si é muito bom, a série pra mim só foi boa até este RE4, o resto perdeu a linha.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9oudq5Dxr0",Recommended
One of the most undderated titles of all time. Resident Evil 4 is one of the best resident evil games ever made and the first resident evil game I ever played. The controls are great and responsive and the story is cheesy as all get out but entertaining and actually can be genuinly scary at times. A great game for people who are new to horror video games and are just looking for a fun experience.,Recommended
A wonderful game with fire that looks like magic.,Recommended
"I won't waste your time with the obvious: RE4 is amazing. The gameplay and atmosphere are solid throughtout and the story is typical Resi B-movie nonsense with hilariously bad writing, but the characters are lovable enough. Although you may want to leave Ashley to the monsters at times...\n\nThe ""HD"" textures seem to be hit-and-miss. The character models look good but some of the environment textures look straight from 2005. The new 60FPS mode is so smooth, I don't think I could back to 30FPS, although it did give some problems on some of the climbing quicktime events (be sure to switch to 30FPS before the minecart section).\n\nFor £15, this is certainly a must-have for Resi fans or anyone who didn't get round to finishing it first time around (me).",Recommended
"Looking back at Resident Evil 4 it's almost startling how good this game ended up. It was in development for a really long time, shifted between completely different concepts and almost ended up scrapped a few times.\n\nYet it pulled through, and became one of the most notable action games of the 6th generation. I say action game because that was what made Resi 4 so good. \n\nResi 4 does not take place in the 'states like it's predecessors. Nor do you ever fight zombies. Instead you fight infected villagers. The dev team actually did this in a very unique way. Because of how the game employs a manual aiming system, firing at different body parts produces different reactions from enemies. Like you can stumble an enemy running at you by shooting him in the legs. This provides immense amounts of strategy to fighting enemies. Adding to that enemies will work together and use the environment against you.\n\nThe atmosphere was extraordinary, the enemies were engaging and the combat was slick and new. Resi 4 might have not aged very well in the last 10 years, but it still leaves an impact that lasts a long time.",Recommended
Cutscenes are utter crap. I shouldn't have to buy a game thats been released multiple times only to see that i can't enjoy the story(One of the most important details in video games) if the characters move their lips like it's a Bruce Lee film. Should have expected this from a large company like Capcom.,Not Recommended
"Basically if you haven't played Resident Evil series before, game may seem a bit clumsy. Well that's obvious. It has been released 7 years before and people in nowadays rather spend money on new battlefield DLC than on old singleplayer shooter. However I enjoyed every second of it. It's combination of FPS, strategy (more or less), and the best thing ... Zombies. Cool missions, secrets, bosses and main character is Leonardo di Caprio. What could be better?\n\n So would I recomment it to you?\nThere are many kind of people and I'm quite sure 50% of them won't understand meaning of it so better watch some gameplay videos if your really decided to buy it.\n\nI find this game addicting and it's my 3rd favourite game after Metro 2033 & Last Light.\n\n8/10.

One of the best games for the Gamecube becomes even better with the Resident Evil 4 Ultimate HD port on PC! I have to say i'm impressed on how good this game is on PC. 60fps is like night and day and the PC controls while akward at first feel natural after an hour or two.\n\nI'm also glad that Capcom updated the textures as it makes the game look really good by todays standards. The only complaint I have is that the Rifles reloading animation is stuck at 30fps and not 60fps. but it's a small price to pay.\n\nI give this a 9/10,Recommended
"The new HD texture package is quite neat, but nothing beat the classic game (Gamecube edition in my case).\nThe controls are quite retarded at times, but that isnt gonna change and when/if you get used to it, you can still play the game without being dragged down by it :-D\nIf you like RE4 its almost a most-have for another playthrough, but if you have your old PS2, Wii, GC, you´ll be better off",Recommended
"RE4 is easily one of my top 5 games of all time, so it's great to see it on Steam as probably one of the best HD remakes I've ever seen. I can't say much about it that hasn't already been said. It's fun, visceral action that lets you have your murderparty, but makes ammo and health just scarce enough to make each murderparty feel like it had an actual cost. It introduced the world to quicktime events (for better and for worse), blew our minds with its diverse cast of monsters to mow down, and gave us weapons-grade B-movie dialogue to make endless fun of. I'm almost certain I've finished the game more than fifteen times over, but somehow, I still have just as much fun now as I did my first time through, and that's an accomplishment. I rarely consider a game perfect, but this deserves the label.",Recommended
"A long and challenging game that provides a lot of action. Although it is an action game sooner than a horror one, it is the calculated kind of action game. You have to think through what you're doing, and luckily the professional difficulty is only unlocked when you pass the game at least once on normal difficulty so you will already know what you will be facing and what you're supposed to be before you choose a dificulty that's actually very challenging. \n\nTo play this game you need [b]skill and a lot of patience[/b], as well as quick reflexes. The QTEs can sometimes be pretty annoying.\n\nThe game still has some bugs, but updates are constantly being released and there is even a public beta that gives you the newest patches before they are officially released, and the game looks a lot better than the original.\n\nThere is a lot of content in this game. It starts out slow, you will probably be wondering how this is a Resident Evil game, but trust me when I say that it gets a lot better later. The enemies you face are completely different later on and the bosses are unique and offer great boss battle experiences.\n\nThere are a lot of treasures and secrets in each level, and by the time you finish the game you will most likely want to play through it again! The game offers huge replayability! When you finish the game you get a cleared save, which lets you start a new game with the same difficulty as the cleared save's difficulty with your entire inventory from the end of the game, and you even unlock new things you can buy in shops by completing the main game as well as the DLCs. It's also important to note you unlock new costumes, not just for Leon but for other characters as well, and you can choose which to use when you start the game.\n\n[b]The downside[/b] for modern gamers is that it's not a fast-paced kind of shooter. It requires a lot of concentration and sheer willpower to beat some levels and if you never played classic hardcore games before you will probably not like this one either. The aiming feels awkward, your enemies come in large numbers and deal a lot more damage than you do, so you will have to skirmish and play safe a lot in this game. The graphics, although greatly improved when compared to the original, still have that classic look and if you're used to playing games like Crysis or the new Call od Duty games or similar, you will probably not like this game's graphics. It's an excellent game, but you have to have a certain appreciation for old-school titles.\n\nIt is a difficult game. Maybe not Dark Souls difficulty, but by the time you face some of the end-game enemies, you will probably be praising the Sun with each victory.\n\nTo sum up, a must-have for fans of classic games and the Resident Evil franchise!",Recommended
This game is not small time.,Recommended
"Resident evil 4 is a sequel that changed this franchise for worse, however this is a really good game. \n\nThe story is that the president’s daughter: Ashley graham is kidnapped and held in a rural town somewhere in Europe, most likely somewhere in Spain where everyone is infected with the plagas virus which involves and an evil cult who wants to take over the world. The story starts off trying to be grim, disturbing and serious than halfway through the game the story decides to become completely ridiculous and not take itself seriously. \n\nThe gameplay is a significant change from the previous games: you now have a third person over shoulder view point with precision aiming though you still control like a tank, (moving forward and backwards but turning left and right) there are a lot more enemies this time round and they are basically piñatas and drop health items, ammo and money, there’s a currency system where you can by weapons and upgrades from a merchant and you can also sell treasure to the merchant, your inventory system is now a suit case with a grid and all of your times are now represented as diagrams varying in size from the smallest being an egg and the largest being a shotgun or a sniper rifle, typewriters are much more common now and you can use them how many times you want now instead of having limited saves on ink ribbons, you also have quite a varied enemy roster from snakes, to your standard human enemies, to the heavies, giant bugs, dogs and the infamous man with a chainsaw aka Jason Voorhees from part 2, and the gameplay itself usually shifts and changes quite a lot. There are still boss fights and puzzles but for the most part this is a third person shooter more than anything. Oh yeah and you have to escort Ashley for half of the game. \n\nThe things I don’t like about this game are:\n\nThe quick time events. Sometimes you’ll just be watching a cut scene than all of a sudden QUICK TIME EVENT and then you die and have to watch the cut scene over and over because you weren’t quick enough the first time it the buttons to press change each time. \n\nAshley graham: one you have to escort her for half of the game which is bad enough (luckily if there’s a dumpster you can just throw her into it and clear the area first) but also she’s really annoying, how many times did you want to twist her head of her shoulders every time she says: “LEEEEOOONNN, HAAAAAAAAALLLPPPP!!!” “HALP ME LEON!!” and every time she screams…ughh… \n\nEven when you’ve upgraded the handguns its random of how many shots it takes to blow someone’s head off. \n\nThis game can be quite frustrating at times but it’s not all that bad. (Resident evil 5 gets the crown for being the most frustrating and annoying) \n\nBut for the most part this is a fun game to play, it’s the only third person resident evil game that I would say is definitely worth playing.",Recommended
Not Recommended HD textures but a nice upgrade from console versions. Not much better though in detail. Still fun to play and its best looking version to date but again the textures are still blown out and not Recommended HD. Wish they improved on textures a bit more and field of view before release.

"One of the greatest horror games of all time. If you consider yourself a fan of the third person shooter genre, the horror genre, or video games in general, you are doing yourself an immense disservice by not playing this game. The PC controls are a little odd at first, but once you get the hang of it they feel great. Tons of replayability. Runs great, and the graphics have held up pretty well for a game of it's age.",Recommended
"Worth getting on a console, but Recommended to Capcom's greed, this is little more than a poor port. I'm guessing by 'HD', they mean they have 720p textures, because they still look very poor on the same low-poly models. Capcom simply made the game in a disrespectful money grab to the PC community. The game is a legend on consoles because the controls are centered around those. This port does a horrid job accommodating PC gameplay mechanics. Don't be fooled into thinking that your pin-point mouse precision is going to help you here, because the game's camera and gun controls are loose and floaty, making it a chore to do things as simple as aiming.",Not Recommended

"This game brings back a lot of memories for me, and good one's at that. Some people say it's the game that ruined the franchise of Resident Evil by introducing action elements to a survival horror game. Other may say it's the best Resident Evil game there is. I stand somewhere towards the middle, leaning to the best game in the series side. I can agree with the action elements getting out of hand with 5 and 6, but this game balanced the action and the horror pretty well. I like this game in the series so much mostly because it's a very tense and nerve wracking game. Anyone who's played it knows that when you hear that chainsaw revving up, your heart will skip a beat...just me? I doubt that. ;)\n\nAnyways the game's features include:\n*3rd person/over the shoulder point of view\n*Many guns (if you're into that type of thing)\n*A pretty great main protagonist\n*A lousy side character, but adds to the tension definetly\n*Many great modes, not just a story mode\n*Story that's okay (looking for grade A story, this isn't your game)\n\nOverall, I'd give this game an 8/10, and I definitely recommend it!",Recommended

"This game is just simply put great. I'll try to make this review as understanding as possible and clear out what I like and dislike about it. Please be warned that I may include some spoilers here.\n\n\nSo to start off, I haven't played much of the Resident Evil games. In fact, the only ones I ever played were Resident Evil 2 and this back in the day. The fact that this game also looks back at the causing events of Resident Evil 2 just amazed me, but it was kinda wasn't necessary considering the game was a whole lot different and had nothing to do with the plot of those past events.\n\nI used to own this game back in I think.....I'll take a wild guess and say 2009 or somewhere like that and I used to play it at least 15 hours a day. It was that addictive. Yes, I eventually got bored of it and gave it away with my PS2 and other games, but I never thought I'd replay this game again. Once I saw it was in the store, I got my credit card and bought the game as soon as possible. Why? Because I know, for an opinion, that it was worth it. I was pretty inspired by how the game has been altered in this PC version, a bit different from the console versions but even better. The game kinda slows down from time to time but I won't count that as a con, considering it may as well just be my computer...ha! Back on topic, I know I haven't played this game too much and the fact that I'm writing this review only after playing a bit of it from the PC version barely passing the first part makes me sound like I'm not one to talk....or review. The plot itself is a major development for the game and I loved it. The weapons and combat within the game were also appealing, yet amazing. I truly enjoy it. The fact that the enemies were challenging from the very beginning and got even better as I played through the game was truly a sight! The gameplay is pretty great.\n\nNow as for the cons, not too major. Also, this paragraph will be filled with spoilers so read at your own risk. For one, this game really kinda....well.....how would I say it.....did a bad part on including past characters such as Ada Wong and Jack Krauser. The fact that Ada Wong appears out of nowhere on this secret mission and how she ended her mission by betraying Leon was really pathetic in my opinion. Also, what's even worse is how Krauser, Leon's old comrade who used to be partners, friends that had a great relationship, survives the wreck and is all OP with the zombie plauge. Really left me with that phrase, ""Are you kidding me""?, from time to time. Also, the fact that the enemies aren't really.....zombies that deal damage by biting your neck like in RE2 really made the game less scary and horror like in my opinion. See, when I hear the word, ""Resident Evil"", the first topic that comes to mind is zombies. For one, the enemies aren't zombies and are just infected with a plauge. The way they act and the sounds they make is disgusting, kinda annoys me but I can deal with it.\n\nOverall, the game is pretty fun. Every game has its pros and cons but one will eventually dominate the other. Despite the cons I saw within the plot and the enemies, I still recommend this game as it'll take quite the while to get bored of and I ain't gonna get bored of this game any time soon. So make the right decision and buy this game if you are looking for appealing action and a great plot along with its challenges ;)\n\nRating:\n8/10",Recommended

"Resident Evil 4: Ultimate HD Edition,\na scare from the past or a ruined childhood?\n\n--ABOUT--\n\nResident Evil 4 was originally released on the GameCube back in 2005,\nand claimed high critics and overall top scores.\n\nYou play as Leon Kennedy, and your mission is to rescue Ashley Graham,\nthe president's daugther. She's been kidnapped and brought to a village\nsomewhere in Spain. And Leon soon realizes not everything is normal in\nthis village.\n\nThis Re-release of Resident Evil 4 has been given the name Ultimate HD Edition,\nand features revamped textures, all of the bonus contents previously released\non other platforms and improved PC controlls.\n\n--RREVIEW--\n\nFirst off I will start by saying that Resident Evil 4 was one of my favorite games\nduring my childhood. I loved the hell out of that game. Unfortunately\nI sold my old GameCube system many years ago, so when I saw\nthey were going to release it on Steam, I was genuinely happy,\nI could finally play it again, and it was the Ultimate edition.\n\nWe need to understand that we're talking about a 8-9 year old game,\nand think back to when this game was released, this game\nbroke bounderies for graphics and gameplay back then,\nand there's actually a limit to what they really can do with\nthis re-release. This is not Resident Evil 4 with Crysis graphics,\nit's the same good old engine as the original.\n\nThe textures has been improved slightly, but there are HD\nmods out there that gives you even better textures.\n\nThe gameplay is same as the original, clumsy-tank controls\nwhich adds the feeling of claustrophobia and panic when the\nzombies (Los Ganados) surrounds you.\nIn 2014, we're used to tight responsive controls for the PC,\nso many will not like these old'days tank controls.\n\nTank controls means there's a design aspect where you\ncan't look or turn around using your mouse. To turn around\nand change your walking direction you need to use your\nA and D keys. For many this will bring frustration and agony,\nfor others it's perfect game design which improves upon\nthe scare of the game.\n\nThis is still to-date (based on personal feelings) the best\nResident Evil game made, and this Re-release stays Recommended\nto the original game mechanics and controls.\n\nIt took me around 12 hours to finish this game, after completing\nthe game once, you unlock 3 types of mini-games, ""Separate Ways""\nwhich lets you play as Ada Wong and see her side of the main story\nspanning 5 stages, ""Ada's Assignment"" is a small minigame with\n1 stage only where you need to run around collecting stuff and\nfighting the Los Ganados, and then there's the ""Mercenaries""\ngame which is a type of enemy-wave mode where you need\nto kill as many Ganados as you can within a time limit.\n\nThe objective is to get the highest score possible, and based\non your completion and glory you get to unlock more\ncharacters to use in that game mode, this game mode\nalso features 4 different stages.\n\nCompleting these mini games will award you with\ncostume unlocks for the main characters during the\nmain story game. After completing the game once\nyou also unlock the New Game option, where you\nstart over again but with the equipment, ammo and weapons\nyou had from your previous playthrough.\n\nThe game did have problems at launch, several performance\nproblems, basic elements in the game menu was missing,\nlike Audio Options, unlogical PC control layout for\ninventory management and Quick-Time-Events.\n\n---CONCLUTION---\n\nThis game will easily provide you with 17-25 hours\nof enjoyment (main story + mini games), and even\nmore hours if you decide to do a New Game playthrough.\n\nThe game is a classic, and the game mechanics and controls\nis not like the new modern games. If you're a veteran of\nRE4 and have played the original releases, you will\nmost likely love this new re-release, but if you're new\nto this game, you might find the graphics and\ngameplay disappointing.\n\nThe asking price is 20€. I think it is a tad too high\nfor a 8-9 year old game. So you have to decide for yourself\nif the price is worth it. For me it was.\n\n---SCORE---\n\nI feel it's unfair to compare the graphics up\nagainst today's eyecandy games like Metro: Last Light,\nCrysis and Battlefield, so the graphics score will be\nbased on how good it is compared to how good it COULD\nhave been for this re-release.\n\nBecause of a troubled launch, and some major\nunlogical PC control decisions, this takes a big negative\nhit on the Gameplay score.\n\nGraphics: 7/10\nStory: 7/10\nGameplay: 6/10\nValue: 8/10\n\nScore: 7.0/10",Recommended

"What can I say about this game that most people don't already know?  It was the first over the shoulder attempt in the Resident Evil series and without a doubt the best of the three.  RE5 had the co-op to hold it together, and RE6 was just a joke.  RE4 pushes the limits from time to time, but Leon still feels vulnerable enough to leave a sense of survival behind -- unlike RE5 and 6.  Both difficulties, if played in order, give the player an extremely well balanced game.  Get your knife ready, because you are going to need it!\n\nThe game-play in RE4 is awesome; however, if the player is stepping back from RE5 or 6, then the character will feel a bit clunky at first.  The enemies are also a bit more responsive than in RE5, which keeps the player on his/her toes.  There is a good variety of enemies for each section of the game, and the progression as well as the pacing is spot on.  This game also has better exploration than its follow-ups. Some parts actually require the player to back track in order to acquire certain weapons if he/she does not want to buy them from the merchant.\n\nThe idea of a giant escort mission can sometimes turn people away, but this game creates the perfect setting for such a task, and it also paces the escorting so that it does not become repetitive or annoying.  The escorting brings a feeling of co-op from time to time which helps keep the game interesting.\n\nThe inventory system in this game is hands down the most enjoyable of all the RE titles.  Leon is given  an upgradable backpack that the player can organize to the way he/she sees fit.  The weapons are also upgradable and numerous -- for an RE title.\n\nOver all, this game is well paced, action packed and well designed -- occasionally a little cliche or cheesy.  The PC version doesn't offer much beyond a sharper resolution and better controls for those that prefer a mouse and keyboard, but the game is still worth $20 in my eyes.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=236890077",Recommended

"I played the original GC version, the PS2 version, the Wii version and the horrible original PC port of RE4. This one is by far the best. They really did a good job addressing fans request and redeemed themselves with this. It has everything you come to expect in a PC game. Multiple settings, keyboard and mouse support with ability to change keybindings. So far my only complaint is not being able to map my 360 controller to what I want instead of having to use the default. Granted, there are 3 types of controls for the pad to chose from but all are worthless besides the original. I'm not sure if you can even use another gamepad with this game as you can't rebind keys but I'm gonna hook up my original xbox huge controller to it and see if that works. I hope it does, \n\n I would prefer to use one of my other controllers than the 360, sometimes it feels kinda slow when you aim and I have not noticed a setting to adjust the sensitivity. I also noticed in the options menu things like locked FPS, subtitles and some other things are greyed out. It might be because you can only change those before you are in game. I will test that soon.\n\nIt also takes a bit to get used to using the KB/M, sometimes it is jerky. The game looks fantastic and runs at a smooth 60fps - however that screws up some of the things in the game like enemies moving a bit faster sometimes and so on. I think they addressed this in a recent patch but I just locked my FPS to 30.\n\nIt's only 20 bucks and you just can't go wrong with this if you are a fan of this game. I will update my review the more I play it and upload screenshots. My pc is sorta dated and I'm using a cheap Nvidia 430 GPU and it runs perfectly. I can't wait to get my new GPU so I can crank everything up even more. I highly recommend this game. Worth the money even if you already own it on consoles.\n\n\n[edit] I restarted the game and was enabled to get to the options you can't change during gameplay - except subtitles. It's still blacked out. I'm not sure if it's implemented yet. Hopefully that will be fixed soon or maybe I'm just doing something wrong. Anyways, good hunting!",Recommended

"This is a wonderfully creepy game, with fantastic pacing and a decent enough storyline to keep things interesting. On startup I disliked the controls and camera angle, but as you play you realize the game is very specifcally designed around the controls and the speed of the game suits the actions. The game also supports multiple playstyles--you can succeed as a bull-in-a-china-shop player, or as a more patient player. The game does contain some surprises and shocks, but I didn't encounter any overly cheap tricks. The best part of the game is how terrifying it can get--I jumped and screamed numerous times, and if you really get into it (sound up, lights low) I think you'll find this a good RPG/shooter with fantastic atmosphere.",Recommended

"Trying to decide whether or not to recommend this game is a difficult one.  However, since Steam says I have to pick, then I choose to not recommend it.    My decision to not recommend this game will not be a popular one.  It is based on several factors, the biggest of which is the archaic design choices that artificially increase the difficulty of a game that is fairly difficult on its own merits.  It's not uncommon for older games that get the HD make over to fix design choices that at the time make sense, but have now become out dated for one reason or another.  Or simply update the game based on the current technology available.  The reason why nothing was done in an attempt to fix the lingering issues that plague this game through the design choices boggles my mind.  I understand that ""it was designed intentionally that way"", however that doesn't mean they were good choices to begin with.\n\n  The tank controls might work for an isometric view, however for the over the shoulder third person view, it makes controlling Leon a frustrating chore.  Which in the end is slightly ironic because the stiffness with which Leon moves makes it feel like you are navagating the entire game with a tank instead of the supposedly extremely nimble STARS officer.  The camera movement is just as stiff as Leon, making looking around without aiming your gun virtually impossible.  The natural camera postion is only useful if you are Leon's proctologist as it likes set itself low and looking up Leon's butt.  The inventory has zero mouse support, which I still cannot figure out how that happened.  I can only guess that it was something that was overlooked.\n\n  The game features numerous QTE's, most of which require lightning quick reflexes as they tend to be blink and you die situations.  The fact that most of the prompts are only on the screen for less than a second and a half is only compounded by the fact that they change on repeated attempts.  Which is THEN made even worse by the issue of the game not registering the command imput.  More than once did I find myself in an instant death situation because dispite my furious pounding of the X button the game decided I wasn't pushing the button.  Sometimes the game can't even decide which QTE it wants.  More often than not, it'll tell you to push one combination of buttons just to switch it to a second combination a split second after the first set pop up.\n\n  The bosses run the range of frustrating bullet sponges where you're not entirly sure you're doing the right thing because the boss barely reacts to the damage you're inflecting; to cleverly designed bullet sponges that partially a puzzle to figure out and require paying meticulous attention to the tells that let you know it's safe to attack.  Unfortunatley, the latter is far and few between compared to the former.\n\n  I found this game to be an absolute chore to play.  Everytime I started to have fun, the game would then punish me for trying to find something I enjoy in this game.  Ultimately, I find this game to be a poor PC port of a game that is almost 10 years old.  Funnily enough, 2 years after the initial release, the game recieved a poor PC port.  So what we have here is a HD upgrade to the poor port of a poor port.\n\n",Not Recommended

"Absolutely breathtaking. I sadly never owned GC, PS2 or any console except for PC so I was never able to truly experience this game in its full glory. I´m rather not going to to talk about the absolute travesty that was the original RE4 PC port, because that was one of the worst ports of any game on any console of all time (arguably). But this game is a totally different story. If you played RE4 before, there really isn´t much here for you, because this really is just a remastered version of the Xbox 360 version for PC. Calling this game an ULTIMATE HD EDITION is kinda a stretch. Graphics are certainly good but it isn´t anything incredible. I found controls very intuitive and although it took some time to get used to, after about 30 mins I had absolutely no problems with them. Framerate can be set to ""Fixed 30 FPS"" and ""Fixed 60 FPS"". 60 FPS is smooth and awesome, however there are a few issues with QTEs when playing on 60 FPS (some people experience them, some don´t), so 30 FPS although not nearly so nice, is probably the safe way to go. Alot of people were talking about crashing. Even though this game crashed on me 2 minutes in, I already have more that 8 hours in it and it didnt crash since. Bottom line: Did you already play this game on another console? - don´t get it unless you really want to play it on your PC. You never played this game? - GET IT NOW!!",Recommended

"As an audio enthusiast, this game blows chunks. It's not that I'm an audiophile, it's just that this game has no positional audio and all NPC sound effects seem to be one volume (loud) regardless of how far away they are. The sound effects are MONO and DO NOT PAN based on an NPC's position. Positional audio is not some mystery Dolby proprietary technology. Dolby is mostly used as an audio codec like people use MP3 to compress WAV files. This game utilizes XAudio2 to process audio and can do positional audio, but implementing just the most basic audio features that we take for granted (stereo, surround sound, dynamic volume levels, spatialization) seems to have been completely ignored.\n\nMusic and some environmental effects such as crickets are stereo, but that's because they were encoded that way. Any sound data that is mono, is played back in either the front center channel or the front two speakers simultaneously.\n\nI'll change this review if the issue is resolved, but until then, I can't consider this game ""ultimate"" until the audio is given proper attention.\n\nUpdate: Come to think of it, the ""ultimate"" edition of RE4 should be based on the Wii version of the game, not the 360 version of the HD version.\n\nUPDATE: Beta 1.0.5 has some positional audio corrected so it seems that the audio problem is being worked on.\n\nLikely final update: They implemented some positional audio as if they were testing the issue but never completely went through with it so it's hit or miss.",Not Recommended

WIth over 100 hours logged on this game i would be lying if i said i dont know about this game. To start out, the game is a must play - but i want to focus about this release an ""HD RE RELEASE"". \n\nI own Resident Evil 4 on the PS2, Gamecube and the WII - and i also own the original release for the Computer. I have to admit -  the original computer release is best played with mods loaded to the brim. There's alot of HD Texture mods, HD High Poly Models, and everything that makes it look so much better than this so called ""HD Version"". HOWEVER - this version is made for the computer - with Native high res support for 1080p, Native mouse and keyboard support and the game runs at a very steady 60fps. However, this is a complete rework of the game, so for me - that means all of my awesome mods that ran on the game before the HD Verison release - will no longer work. \n\nTo get to the point, This HD version release is great, if you want RE4 in 1080p, 60fps greatness, with leaderboards and slightly updated textures to boot.

"What can I say? It's the classic, with some revamped textures. Now, before I continue, let me warn you that I'm about to dump a lot on this release... not to say that I don't like it, nor that I don't recommend it (quite the contrary, if you haven't picked it up on steam yet, do so!), but Capcom's had quite a while to work on this release and yet they've only come up with something that's slightly better than what modders had already achieved on the first PC Port.\n\nFirst things first: control scheme. This game was designed to be played with a controller, and it can only really be appreciated by being played on a controller. The keyboard+mouse support is no better than the old PC Port with the fan-made mouse support mod.\n\nSecond: the textures aren't [i]that[/i] great. Basically, it's just a more polished official version (but nothing that the fan-made mods didn't do for the original PC port).\n\nThird: what really sets it apart is the dynamic lighting (really gives a more realistic feel, since the night is darker and the torches/lamps really contribute to the lighting). But other than that, it offers very little improvement in regards to visuals. It sports 3 post-processing effects which are nothing more than glorified color filters... And it also ""sports"" full 60 frames per second capabilities, which happen to be very dependent on rig specs (and this doesn't mean that by having the latest graphics card you'll pull it off without problems, since the engine is very finnicky and only plays well with certain setups), and the game engine isn't really prepared to run at 60 frames per second (some animations, like falling debris after an explosion, play out rapidly... like twice as fast... coincidentally, the game was designed to be run at 30 frames per second).\n\nFourth: one of the last weapons you obtain (after finishing pro mode) is the version present in the Wii release (multi-target). So YAY!\n\nBasically, that's all I have to say. I know it sounds a bit negative, but that's just to warn you that this isn't like the Resident Evil 1 remake at all. This is just a facelift to a game that's already dated... but a really fun and worthwhile game at that. The story is great, the pacing is nearly perfect, and all the elements come together to make it an experience you certainly won't forget. And one which you'll definitely come back to later. Personally, it's better than both RE5 and RE6... but that's just me.\n\nSo is it worth it? [b]Heck yeah![/b]",Recommended

Unfortunatly the game turns into a third-person shooter towards the end and is more of an action game than a survival horror, but I still enjoy it. This is a great game if you are trying to get into the Resident Evil series and I will definatly buy the next one (As soon as I have money).",Recommended
"There's always that one game you pretty much know inside out, for me it's Resident Evil 4.\nThat being said, I am by no means a professional player here. I'm still scared of levels, I still dread encounters I know are coming, and I still end up missing a great deal of my targets - but it's fun.\nINSANE fun. Try using one gun, or only eggs, or using no health or upgrades and just running away.\nThis may have lead to the decline of the series but at least it set a noteable benchmark.\n\n\nMonsters, Guns, Upgrading, Headshots, Horror, Cults, Inventories, Attractive Girls and plenty of Gore. \nI think that equals a well earned: Heck Yes!",Recommended
"This game is the BIGGEST disappointment! \n\nThe actual game is a Recommended classic and there would be so many RE fans that, like me, were really looking forward to this PC release. \n\nAll I can say is the mouse controls are attrocious! \n\nThere is no defending it either. Even with settings maxed out and using a topline gaming mouse with fully adjustable dpi as well as tweaking windows settings, and using a very good gaming rig this game has a useless mouse support coupled to a dinosaur of a gameplay engine for todays PC's. That is the most disappointing aspect about this release and the sad thing is that the game itself is worthy of so much more.\n\nAll continuity in the game is lost and you just cannot move the character around as easily as you should be able to. When in melee and combat situations you may as well just give up as the controls really need to be more responsive and user friendly. I guess if you like a challenge and have the patience of a saint and don't mind being killed time after time then this game is for you.\n\nA total letdown especially when you consider they have the RE5 game mechanics they could have used to improve the gameplay systems in this game for PC  ....  a patch is badly needed and its a ripoff in my opinion!",Not Recommended

"When I heard my favorite Resident Evil game was coming out for PC, I was pumped. Now that I have it, I'm extremely disappointed. The game is unplayable for me. The talking animations and voice audio don't match up, aiming is messed up, and worst of all, the whole game moves a long as if in slow motion. My running speed is slower then walking speed, no joke.

"This is both a really short review and a recommendation for those who are having the slow-motion cutscenes and slow-motion in game problems.\n\nThe Review: I loved this game when it came out on Gamecube and PS2, and am loving it now that its on PC. By far my favorite Resident Evil game in the franchise. 9.5/10\n\nNow, for those who are having the aformentioned problems above, I found a solution for my computer (I will list specs at end of review.) \n\nWhat I think the problem is (at least for my computer) involves the two options for Frames Per Second in this game. My computer couldn't handle the game constantly trying to get itself at 60 FPS, thus causing the ""slow-motion"" effect. What I ended up having to do was turn my frames down to constant 30 FPS instead.  I also lowered the resolution down from 1600x900 to 1280x720. Both of these things can be done in the in game options/video options menu. This fixed slow motion problems and now my game runs just fine. \n\nIf you continue to have these problems after lowering FPS and the resolutions (try experimenting) then you probably either have to slow of a computer, or something else is wrong. \nThis is just a quick fix guide that happened to work perfectly for me and took like 2 minutes of experimenting to find my ideal setup.\n\nNow for my specs: AMD Quad-Core Processor A6-5200\n\nAMD Radeon HD 8400 Graphics Card\n\n6GB DDR3 Memory\n\nI use Windows 8.1 (sometimes can affect games)\n\nHopefully this helped anyone who was having these ""Slow-Mo"" problems, as I saw many people asking why this was happening in forums and on Steam.\n\nPS: Almost forgot, if you want to improve performance, right click on RE4 in your Library go to ""Properties"" then ""Set Launch Options"" then put in this: -high -cpuCount= -noSplash -maxMem=\n\nNow for cpuCount, put in how many cores you have for your computer, for example it should look like this: -cpuCount=6 \nif you have a 6 core processor.\n\nFor -maxMem, put in the number of Mb of ram you have (there's 1024 megabytes in a gigabyte) so if you have 6 gigabytes of ram then it would look like: -maxMem=6144              because 6X1024=6144Mb. \n\nSo now my first example would look like this with those specs: -high -cpuCount=6 -noSplash -maxMem=6144\n\nThat's what it should look like when you type it in.\n\nAs a last note, make sure all of the little dashes ""-"" are in front and there's spacing between each command            \n""-high -cpuCount"" etc.\n\n\nHopefully this helped those that were having these problems and the last bit helped those that just needed a little bit of help making the game run better. This is NOT a fix all, be all guide, it's just a little bit of help for that extra oomph and for those who were having the ""Slo-Mo"" problem.\n\nCheers,\nTiny Box Tim\n\nPS: My computer is not the highest end as far as computers go (most who view my specs can probably tell), but I can run the game just fine after these changes. Also, apologies for this being kind of an essay. \n\nPSS: Also, ignore what Steam says about me not playing this game, it may say around 0.0 or 0.1 hours, but I've played at least 3 hours of the game.",Recommended

Very nice port. Was one of my favourite games so was a pleasure to play through again. Would like to see them do this with Resident Evil 2 and the outbreak games though. \nDuring points this game had massive slow down and unsynced cut scenes...

"Ahh this game was great back in the old days, still is to this very day actually, the port isn't THAT bad at all, which is really weird, but I shall explain.\n\nPROS:\n\nFramerate/HD version: Yup this game is now even MORE high res than the PS3 and 360 versions, and to cap it all off you can pick the settings to 30 frames or 60 frames, why you would put it on 30 is beyond me though.\n\nNothing has changed: From what I can see nothing has really changed, then again I didn't get THAT far in the console version, since the Wii is utter s%$t, and the aiming on that console was terrible, especially the castle level.\n\nInventory: You can get a HUGE inventory in this game, and I love it, although at times it's like a game of damned tetris since you have to move everything around where you want it/want more space, and the fact you have to pause the game to get your gun out each time, it's not annoying though, nice for a second of relaxation.\n\nAshley: I may or may not get hate from this, but Ashley is the ONLY AI character I enjoy having, mainly because you can hide the b#$ch in a dumpster and she won't leave until you say so, nice since you don't have to worry about her all that much.\n\nKeybindings: When I played this I was a little scared cause I didn't know what the key bindings would be, but they are kind of simple really, except for some button pressing sequences anyway, those can be a hassel 1-2 times.\n\nThe Beginning of the end: What I mean by this, is that this game was the point of ALL Resident Evils, and after this they dropped pretty damn quickly, cause 5 you had annoying sheva and the GOD AWFUL inventory system, Yes Sheva I know i'm hurt and I see that you care, but seriously, I ONLY LOST A PEG OF HEALTH DONT BE SO DAMN MOTHERLY.  And don't get me started on 6 or Racoon City, cause Racoon city was just terrible, and 6 was a little better but still awful.\n\nAmmo and health: When I started this I got a HUGE ammount of ammo and health, and I thought ""Man I wonder if I should have put this on a harder difficulty..."" Then later I barely had any ammo left and a crapton of healing items, seriously RE4 you could be a LITTLE more forgiving, yes I know the enemies drop stuff but it's mainly money, give me some damn ammo or something.\n\nBosses: Some of the bosses are a total challenge to fight and some are just really simple, like the lake monster you fight all you have to do is avoid him running you into trees and just start throwing spears at him the whole time, don't even have to waste ammo.\n\nThe ""Merchant"": I still don't know why this guy is here, or why i'm buying/selling stuff from/to him, but atleast he's not a a$$hole or anything, but DONT KILL HIM, or you won't be able to buy/sell anything ever again for the whole game, but the one thing I REALLY hate is that he doesn't sell ammo or grenades, WHY?! When I go to his big shops I can SEE ammo and such in the back behind him, what, is he hoarding it or something?\n\nBlock doors/windows: In certain areas like the town you can block the doors or windows with bookshelves and dressers that are nearby, it's nice to barricade a part of the room, atleast for a bit till they end up breaking it down, that way you don't have to worry as much.\n\nCONS:\n\nMouse aiming: The aiming with the mouse is a little weird, but it's not bad, it's a little slow behind you're actual movement but i'm sure if they would have made it like a actual aiming mouse it would have made the game WAY too easy, so i'm glad they didn't change it.\n\nAmmo: Ammo ends up being VERY scarce later on in the game, I recommend trying to keep ammo of a certain type on you at all times and using other guns instead, I made the mistake of wasting some on downed enemies when I should have knifed them.\n\nKnife: Yes it is useful for breaking barrels and crates but I never really used this thing other than that, I did start using it later when I was low on ammo, I would shotgun the guys down, run over there, and just start knifing them, actually did more than what I thought it would, I wish they would have made the knife abit more obvious or maybe something that got peoples attention, cause I rarely use it.\n\nDogs: THESE mother f#$kers are the most annoying enemy out there, if they jump on you they can take a good 1/4 or 1/2 of your health away in just one pounce, REALLY?! I like challenge but when a enemy is heavily overpowered it gets really tedious to fight them.\n\nSome bosses: Some bosses are a total D$#k half the time, later you have to fight these 2 giants in a boiler looking room, you can make one fall into the lava to die so you will only have one left, the problem? If you get too close to the edge of the one that fell in the f#$ker grabs you and pulls you in with him, one time I was in there and made the guy fall in, then I went around the edge, he popped OUT OF THE LAVA and pulled me in, seriously?  Hell a button pressing sequence would have been PERFECT there.\n\nNo subtitles: There is a option but it's not accessible, which is really annoying, there may or may not be a fix for this, it's just a little thing I hate, I like to read what they are going to say most of the time.\n\nThe god damned Rail sequence: At one point you go into a tomb and have to ride a railcar to get to the other end where this key is at, now enemies can drop into the carts with you, but you can shoot them off before you get to them and make them fall, but it's a total b#$ch to hit them, and even the quick time sequence at the end killed me about 5 times, I am glad I don't have to deal with that again.\n\nWHAT I THINK: I think that CAPCOM had actually done something good apart from the other hideous Resident Evil games that have been made, i'm looking at you 5 and 6, and you too racoon city.  I am really glad they brought this to PC, because I loved this game so much back in the day and I still love it to this very day, it's one of the actual good games that is still entertaining.\n\nOut of all it gets a good 8/10, there are some things that still annoy me but once you get past them atleast you don't have to worry about it again, unless you decide to do another playthrough.\n\nIs this worth it on it's current price? YES. On a sale? YES.",Recommended

"Well, after playing through the game several times, unlocking all the achievments, and doing more research into this, I've come to the conclusion that I cannot recommend Resident Evil 4 to everyone in its current state. \n\nElaborating on that, I CAN recommend it to you if you have a very high-end PC. I mean higher than the Recommended specs listed on the store page, because this game is poorly optimized and will cause lag even if you have a decent computer that can run other high demand games at fair settings and a steady frame rate. Even setting the textures to SD and locking at 30FPS can still cause slowdown in some rooms.\n\nSlow down problems aside, the game is also moderatly buggy. Nothing game-breaking I've noticed so far, but after an event that takes the camera away from Leons back (such as being grabbed by an enemy), the camera will glitch out and be stuck in the position it took when you were grabbed until you move your mouse/analog stick around. That will most likely be fixed in an upcoming patch, and I haven't noticed any other horrible bugs.\n\nBut the second biggest problem I have with this port is the extremely lacking texture quality. Promising ""HD textures"" was a flat out lie. The game does have some slightly upscaled textures, but it mostly feel like they took the models, items, and about 50 of the most common assets and polished them up a bit. So I hope graphics aren't a big deal for you, because you certainly won't be getting your moneys worth there. Some guy took it upon himself to make his own HD textures for the Wii version using Photoshop and his textures look BETTER than what people at Capcom are being PAID to do! And he's doing it by himself! Utterly disgraceful.\n\nSo, in review:\n\nPros\n+Good gameplay\n+Decent mouse support \n+Achievments and Leaderboards\n\n\nCons\n-Limited graphics settings\n-Subtitles option is displayed in the graphics menu, but cannot be turned on (WTF)\n-Poor texture quality \n-Locked at either 30 or 60 FPS, no in between or above\n-50/50 chance a QTE will use the X and C keys, a very strange choice considering most QTEs are instant death and people would not be prepared to reach down and hit both X and C (it feels like it doesn't even work sometimes)\n\nIf this game is availible to you on another medium (Wii, Gamecube, PlayStation 2, or the other HD versions on 360/PS3) I'd recommend those over this half-baked port.",Not Recommended

"Resident Evil 4 took the franchise to a different level of survival horror and action. The campaign itself is relatively long and features Leon Scott Kennedy, a fan favorite character from Resident Evil 2. The gameplay itself was a drastic improvement from previous titles in the series, abandoning the fixed camera angles and switching to a 3rd person view. Another feature added into the mix was a grid based inventory system, which sometimes forced the player to make some decisions when it came down to being low on space. Aiming a weapon is easier than ever thanks to laser sights, and becomes more challenging as you progress farther into the story. Ammunition can be scarse during the beginning, but becomes more available later on. Your mission is to rescue the president's daughter from a mysterious group, and survive the nightmare that awaits you. Not only will you need to protect yourself, but also Ashley from the hordes of enemies you will face. Along the way you will collect gold which can be used in exchange for weapons and upgrades that will greatly help you get through the whole story. Resident Evil 4 is by far a masterpiece, and still shines after its original release on the Nintendo Gamecube. If your a fan of survival horror, and have yet to play Resident Evil 4, what are you waiting for? You know what your buying next, and certainly not at a high price, for $19.99, it's a wise chose.",Recommended
"What need be said? Resident Evil 4 came out in 2005 on the Gamecube, and eventually landed on PS2, XBOX 360, Wii, probably PS3 and original XBOX as well. Now, it's been released on Steam 9 years later, and it's selling like hot cakes for a reason. This is the FIRST Resident Evil game I ever played, and I originally didn't want to bother with it. ""What? No zombies? Screw that, sounds lame, it's not even FPS!"" I said, but my good friend told me ""Nah man, you have to try it. I know what you mean, but here I am, RE2 is my favourite in the series, but I still love RE4 as well!"" So I tried it, and of course, it has become one of my all time favourite games. I've since played the first Resident Evil, Code: Veronica, Outbreak File 1 and 2, RE5... and that sixth one... ugh... and well, RE4 is my favourite, with RE5 probably coming 2nd, and the original at 3rd. I'm sure if I played through the RE2, it'd probably come in at 3rd or maybe even beat RE5 for 2nd.\n\nIt's truly unfortunate that RE5 has become more of a 3rd person action game rather than a survival horror, and RE6 was just... blegh... HOW DO YOU SCREW UP ZOMBIES?! Anyways, I find RE4 still retains much of the survival horror that the more recent releases are lacking. It has a decent amount of firearms (Not as many as RE5, but there is still a nice selection), I love the inventory system even if it is outright unrealistic, and the characters are very well rounded. Voice acting, atmosphere, good puzzles, the only things I can say that I hate about the game is some of the Quick Time Events. Also, some of the firearms in the game don't shoot the ammo that is given, however that can be overlooked.\n\nI do like to pay extra attention to realism in games, however RE4 is so much fun, I easily look past the few unrealistic qualities it has. Even if you're a diehard FPS gamer like I am, even if you're really anal about realism like I am, even if you think RE5 and RE6 are leading to the death of the series (IMO, RE5 was saved by the co-op gameplay, interesting inventory system and selection of firearms, however RE6 is outright disappointing), I believe you will still find some fun in RE4 if you haven't yet tried it out. The replayability is amazing, there's LOTS of stuff to unlock, and there is most certainly a challenge if that's what you're looking for. Especially when you unlock Professional mode. There are many memorable scenes, characters that you will genuinely become interested in and come to love or hate, and there are a multitude of ways in which you can approach a situation instead of just go in and start shooting.\n\nOh yeah, in this rendition of RE4, they really went all out with how the game looks. If you have a high-end computer, you can have 60 frames per second, and HD quality visuals. I have a tower that's about a year old and doens't have anything special in it, so I had to bring it back down to 30 frames per second (You can change it in Options on the main menu), and I also turned off the Anti-Aliasing... which I'm not gonna lie, I have no idea what it does in the first place. All I know is when I tried to play it at max settings, the game was basically stuck in slow-mo. Quite annoying. I just turned down some of the graphical options, and it runs almost perfectly :) ... wow, 4 paragraphs. Sorry for typing so much, I hope this helped you decide whether to pick the game up or not. In the end, I can't think of very many reasons NOT to get it lol Like I said, the replayability is there, and if you want to unlock everything, you'll get over 40 hours worth, minimum. \n\nLike I said, there's challenge there if you want it, but if you're more casual and just want to experience the story, or if you're just not used to the unique controls of Resident Evil, then easy mode will be a good way to get past the learning curve without too much hastle.

"You're looking at one of the greatest games ever made and the one game that revolutionized third-person gameplay. Whatever common mechanics you see in third person shooters these days, this game was their inspiration. RE4 is now back on PC as a proper Game Cube port with (some) updated visuals, 30 more frames smoother, and an online leaderboards for you to compete who beats the game the fastest.\n\nNew gamers will find the tank controls and the inability to move while aiming annoying, but you'll get used to the controls after a few minutes of play. Once you do, it's one hell of a ride. Varied environments, weapon customization, areas that are actual obstacle courses, interesting enemies and great bosses. It's lengthy too. One could clock in around 18-20 hours on their first run. After you beat the game, you unlock a new difficulty and three new modes. At best you can complete the entire RE4 experience in 50 hours.\n\nResident Evil 4 is one of those timeless games that you will never get bored of. Want to play one of the greatest games of all time?

"Although not my favourite Resident Evil title, I have been thoroughly looking forward to this release; especially since switching to PC gaming has sadly caused me to miss out on classics such as Metal Gear Solid, Resident Evil etc.\n\nThe store page on Steam states that resident Evil 4 features the following:\n\n-Stunning HD running at a smooth 60 frames per second for the first time. \n\n-A complete visual overhaul has been performed to bring this revered title to the highest graphical quality ever. \n\n-Fully optimized for the wide screen, texts have been sharpened and textures have been upgraded on characters, backgrounds and in-game objects. \n\n-Steam platform support with Steam Achievements, Steam Cloud, Steam Trading Cards, global leaderboards, and full game controller support. \n\n-Native keyboard and mouse support with customizable key binding, mouse sensitivity, and mouse acceleration settings. \n\n- This new PC version will include everything from the prior iterations including subtitle support in English, French, Italian, German, and Spanish as well as previously released bonus content such as the Separate Ways epilogue.\n\n\nNow, I personally would not call it “stunning” – the new textures are okay but nothing to write home about. Yes, they are an upgrade from the original’s blurry, illegible textures (some of which still remain) but they still look dated and fairly low resolution; not to mention some of the old broken-down and dirty textures have been replaced with much cleaner, out of place textures. Luckily, for some users, Capcom offers a choice between original and “HD” textures. On the positive side, the user interface and text do look much sharper and easier on the eyes – far superior in quality to the original game.\n\nThis isn’t helped by the “Motion Blur” setting. Usually I am a fan of such an option, but I know many people love it or hate it. Sadly in RE4 it’s a very low quality blur, almost giving the impression of a lower frame rate. Luckily this option is completely optional, as Resident Evil 4 does a good job of allowing users to change texture quality, shadows, anti aliasing etc.\n\nA comparison between the “HD” and “SD” textures can be found [url=http://www.capcom-unity.com/xantista/blog/2014/02/26/resident-evil-4-ultimate-hd-texture-slider-comparison] [HERE] [/url]\n\nIt is far from a “complete visual overhaul” – especially when compared to games such as Final Fantasy X | X-2 HD Remaster, which not only reworked textures, they improved pre-rendered backgrounds, completely replaced low poly LOD meshes with higher polygon versions and even went the extra mile to completely re-arrange the old MIDI tracks with a full orchestral sound track.\n\nOn to the “Native keyboard and mouse support” - Sadly this is where things get more disappointing. Although Capcom have added the ability to turn mouse acceleration on or off, it’s rather moot as the mouse aiming feels like it’s just emulating  XINPUT commands, causing floaty, clunky aiming that feels far from “native.”\n\nThe most irritating issue regarding controls is that mouse support is completely absent from menu screens, such as the inventory management. Instead, you must use WASD to move the cursor around the grid based attaché case, press E to select it, Page Up and Page Down to rotate and E again to place back down. This is vastly disappointing, I would have expected to simply have a drag and drop system where I can freely move objects with the mouse.\n\nThe game is fully compatible with an Xbox 360 controller, so at least that’s an option if the mouse issues are too much, and unlike the original PC port – This version correctly displays newly textured prompts to correspond with using a controller. No more “Press Button 8 to dodge”.\n\nI must admit, however, even on controller, the control-scheme has not aged well. Like most people, I’ve been spoiled by modern systems, fluid 360-degree motion and 3D camera systems as opposed to Resident Evil 4′s tank controls. I don’t remember the original being so clunky but I’m quite certain that’s due to the system being fairly good for it’s time back then. I wouldn’t class this as a negative, however. It uses the same controls as the original, and if I enjoyed it so much back then I’m sure I just need to get back to grips with an older style of play.\n\nComplaints aside, running Resident Evil 4 at native 1080p at 60fps is a great thing. I cannot imagine myself going back to the 30fps version, and I would go as far as saying, despite its flaws, this is the definitive version of Resident Evil 4. Especially when compared to the original PC port.",Recommended
"Capcom, you did a really good job here. Realtime cutscenes are awesome. =)\nPlease continue adding more features though because there's still some missing stuff:\n-The glowing lights system. If leon overlaps a lightened torch or candle, the flare goes away.\n-And the specular maps on Leon's weapon holders.\n-I noticed two pre-rendered cutscenes throughout Leon's path. One when activating the gear room near the castle.\n and the other one when encountering the predator cinematic. (2nd one where he flies fast at you.)",Recommended
RE4 is the best Resident Evil game period. The HD is a plus. Looks really good. I use a Xbox 360 controller. Feels better than keyboard and mouse.  Buy this game its great.,Recommended
"Resident Evil 4 has been showing its age for some time now, but Capcom has put a solid effort into making the Ultimate HD Edition a must-buy for fans of the genre, as well as those who are itching to return to it or anyone who missed it the first (second, third, fourth, fifth…) time around.",Recommended
"This game is about survival from start to finish. It's a legendary adventure, very worthy of your time.",Recommended
"First things first, people need to start this game with the mentality that this is a 2004 Gamecube game that inspired many of the tropes seen in Third Person Shooters made today. Given that, it's also an incredibly unique game in its own right. This game was designed around controversial ""tank"" controls, and many people who are well adjusted to today's run of the mill TPS may be surprised to find that this game does not allow you to aim, shoot, or reload while on the move. Fear not, for the game has been from start to finish balanced and designed around this fact -- many encounters are designed such that you need to learn when to be shooting, and when to be moving to avoid enemy attacks; in this game they are two distinct actions that you need to constantly evaluate throughout a fight.\nThe game mechanics are top notch, from satisfying melee's (Can you imagine suplexing someone so hard it blows their head off? It's amazing.), to an inventory system that will bring out the OCD in all of us. While it is Recommended that one of the greatest games of the 6th generation is missing some of the current lineup's bells and whistles, if you go in with the right mindset, you'll find that Resident Evil 4 is impeccably paced, balanced, and thought out.\nThe story is right about what you'd expect out of a Resident Evil game; it's a cheesy B movie, filled with memorable one liners (I see the president has equipped his daughter with... ballistics) and villains you'll remember far after you've disposed of them. If you like cheesy, this is the game for you. If you like games full of pretense of greater meaning, you'll need to look elsewhere.\nAnd finally, the game as a PC port. As a long time fan of Resident Evil 4, and a purist, the PC port is everything I could hope it was -- controls are intact, the sweet deadzones left untouched from the Gamecube version, and minus a specular effect here and there, uses the (at the time jaw dropping) assets from the Gamecube version. Textures might stick out to people accustomed to newer games, and yes, you're right, there are no fancy lighting effects, but the game has a clean aesthetic that doesn't blind you from the love put into the game's visual design. There is an HD texture pack available in the menu, however I've found that many textures fail to be consistent, from overly clean wood in some places to the old SD textures in others. Many find them an improvement, while I personally stick with the SD textures, because they are more consistent.\nThe 60 FPS feature is... rushed. If your computer can handle it with no problem, 60fps is a beautiful sight to behold in this game. However some animations are still keyed to 30fps (A result of the game's Gamecube heritage) and can be jarring at times. Also, if your computer cannot run this game at 60fps for any reason, you will experience slowdown due to the way it is coded -- be aware you may need to set the game to run at the original 30fps to allay this.\n\nAll in all, I would recommend this to ANY fan of Resident Evil 4, as this is so far the most complete version to render above the original 480p, and the few hiccups present in the porting are mostly limited to the new additions, and a patch is sure to clear most of those up. For people just getting into it, be ready: This IS NOT A NEW GAME. Keep in mind that it's a Gamecube game that, at the time, revolutionized the TPS genre, and that it will have its resultant quirks, and you're sure to have a good time with this masterpiece.",Recommended
"I couldn't get it to play smooth... Not until i've read a couple reviews had I found out about the changing of the framerates. I already had it uninstalled by that time. I will try it in the future. I still highly recommend this game, Resident Evil 4; the most memorable of Resident Evils' that I will forever cherish.",Recommended

"Resident Evil 4 on Steam is still the same fantastic game it was on the Nintendo Gamecube almost a decade ago, albeit with a couple of technical quirks. \n\nThis mostly has to deal with the new option to adjust the game's framerate from the previous 30 to a silky 60 frames per second. While this works fine about 90-95% of the time, due to the game originally being coded to run at 30fps, cutscene dialogue will de-sync, some particle effects will disappear early, and most damning, timing for the game's many QTEs (notably the ""mash"" actions) are adjusted significantly. Again, the rest of the game is fine, but if you're looking to sit back and watch the cutscenes, or you're stuck on a QTE sequence, you might be better off leaving that setting alone.",Recommended
"Loved this game on Gamecube but this PC versions is yet another lazy port. The ""Ultimate HD"" is hardly noticeable. Perhaps in another 10 years we can get an anniversary edition Super Turbo HD that's actually worthwhile D:",Not Recommended
"It's Resident Evil 4.\n\nMy only real gripe with this version is the mouse controls. It is WAY wonky, to the point where Leon will sometimes flail all over the screen if you turn the mouse too quickly while raising or lowering your gun. You'll inevitably run into this problem at several points in the game, and you WILL die at least once 'cause of it.\n\nOther gripes include: no ability to legitimately exit out of the game once in one, you have to Alt+F4 to exit out. Seriously, this is a thing. No real audio options. No English subtitles (except for some cutscenes). No new content. Except for the single player story, cutscenes play out in hilariously grainy and poor quality movie files.\n\nIf you haven't ever played Resident Evil 4 (though considering it's been on pretty much everything ever; I'm waiting for the Atari 2600 version, myself), this is a good pick. If you haven't played Resident Evil 4 in a long time, this is a good pick. If you want a reminder of what the only good game in the series was, this is a good pick.\n\nOtherwise, this is pretty much just another obligatory Capcom cash grab.",Recommended
"i must admit i can into this game with open eyes not knowing what to expect from it, the game control using the keyboard is clumsy until you get used to it, the xbox controller support is a little better, the graphics are ok by todays standards but having a hint of green through the stages is kind of off putting, gameplay overall and length of game including all extras is definetly worth the £14.99 tag.",Recommended
"They missed many opportunities for the HD textures as they only did it for objects which you barely notice unless you're a hardcore RE4 fan. I don't know if it was just me but I barely got any handgun ammo, instead I got sniper rifle bullets up the ass! Was low on handgun bullets for most of the game, but then again, I don't know if that's just me. Great for Resident Evil 4 fans who just want to play the game on the PC.",Recommended
"One of my all time favorite games. I used to play this game when I was a kid all the time. I've beaten this game around 13 times, and I still love playing the game. The game has a great story, and an amazing Resident Evil addition back in 2006. This is my favorite Resident Evil of all time.\n\nThe game is worth getting and playing.",Recommended
"So many people have probably already played this, but it is still so good. So tense and challenging, while still being fun. Hilarious and over the top melodrama in the plot, but if you know Resident Evil, you expect that and probably love the silliness of it all. My only gripe is the Quicktime events. I HATE THEM. Not just in this game, but any game. There are some things with the controls that feel super dated, but once you accept that it is part of the challenge, it's not hard to get past it. It is so worth playing again.",Recommended
"Still the Great RE4 we've all come to love, there has been small missteps in this release but nothing that should hold anyone back from wanting to RE-experience (get it?) re4.  I went through most of the game pain free but i do have 2 complaints.  The game will randomly ""chug"" after exiting the inventory screen sometimes but it's easily fixed by going right back in and out of the menu.  The mouse controls are not the most refined, it's not like re5's.  Played the whole thing with a controller and it was fine.  There is some terrible gamma problems too but it only was blarringly obvious like 3 times throughout the whole game.  Still a great game for the noslagia kids out there, i was for the msot part always at 60 frames with minimal graphical errors.  Get it!",Recommended
"A great remake of the best selling title. Although the game isn't fully in high-defination, the game still looks phenomenal. The gameplay is all the same. My only concern is the mouse support. The mouse function isn't as great as I thought it would be. But regardless, still a good game to play. I definately recommend this game.",Recommended

"Resident Evil 4 is a great example of a survival horror game, mainly because it takes a slow and steady approach to combat instead of throwing waves of zombies and mutants at you.  the pacing of this game is excellent, as soon as you feel like you have a good thing going, shit hits the fan, and you find yourself low on herbs (health packs) and ammo.\n\nthe backpack where you store you weapons and ammo feels like tetris; it has limited space so you'll always need to be switching stuff around to get the max carrying capacity.\n\nthis game relies heavily on ammo conservation, you cannot buy bullets, so you should really limit yourself to one bullet per enemy. shoot them in the face, roundhouse kick, then knife em while they are down.\n\nthis game won game of the year, and i consider it a must play. bosses are too easy though.\n\nFLASH GRENADES ARE YOUR BEST FRIEND!!!!! no really they make any enemy stumble, so you can get some cheap shots in.",Recommended
"OK, first off --- IF YOU'RE USING A MOUSE AND KEYBOARD YOUR GOING TO HAVE A BAD TIME.\n\nAt first I was disappointed because the pc controls were very poor. Luckily I had a wired xbox 360 controller around and used that. If you use a controller you shouldn't have any problems whatsoever. \n\nI Beat this a bunch of times and unlocked everything on the PS2 back in the day. If you never got around to playing the Resident Evil franchise, you should probably pick this one up. This is one of the good ones. It looks pretty good for how old it is, and the plot is solid. For some reason, there are only 12 achievements for this game. As a regular CS GO player, this is quite weak considering CS GO has 167 achievements. Also I forgot how annoying Ashley is when she screams ""LEON!"", and the merchant only has a handful of sayings.\n\nOverall it's good. I'll admit that $20 is a bit steep for a 10 year old game, but the price will drop with time.\n\n8/10",Recommended

"Resident Evil 4. One of my favorite games and one of the best games of all time. Perfectly paced, tight controls, brilliant story and excellent characters. Needless to say, when I saw this was coming to steam I preordered it on the spot. I have the game on every other system it's come out on, so why not the computer. I mean what could go wrong, it's just a port to the pc. \n\nWell, I would say something major went wrong. They locked the fps at 60.\n\nthe game runs fine, perfectly even, I'm getting the sixty frames per second as advertised. However the cost of this is that the game runs in bullet time. I get to see every frame of every animation in the game. Unless it decides to stop doing that at random intervals which result in the el gigante puching me in my face and/or smashing me into the ground. To be honest if this was just in the gameplay segments I wouldn't have a problem with it, but it's in the cutscenes. Every signle one of them. \n\nThis issue may seem to be a minor gripe, however lets take a look at this from the point of view of someone who had never played the game before. \n\nThey have heard so much about this game and are now finally able to play it since it's on the computer. They buy it and load it up. Now if their copy has the same issue as mine, the first thing they are going to notice is that in the openingcutscene the audio desyncs from the video. ""it's just a glitch."" they say as they continue forward. Once the cutscenes over, they get set adn start heading playing. Only to find that every step takes a second and a half and that the game seems to now be Max Payne having a fever dream. ""could just be the game map loading in."" So the player gets to the first house and gets another desynced cut scene. Than when it finishes the very first enemy starts lumbering over to you in slow motion. You raise you gun and prpare to fire, when the game speeds up and goes at the proper speed. Next thing the first time player knows the villager is upon them and hacking their face off with a scythe. continue this porcess though out the game. \n\nEvery time the cutscenes desync it reminds you that your playing a game and takes you out of the setting and narrative. No matter how much the games trys to set the mood again, it just doesn't stay. The broken out of sync cutscenes, the enemies playing red light green light, and the in ability to see the world in anything other than bullet time destroys this games power. You are no longer able to connect with the characters or feel for their struggle. You sit terrified that the game will speed up when facing an enemy that can one shot you, and may even find your self having trouble with quick time events where failure means death and possiby watching a cutscene over. I'm looking at you krauser. \n\nOverall a very dissapointing port to the pc and I hope that a patch comes out soon to fix this horrific mark on an outstanding game.",Not Recommended

"The game that redefined the third-person shooter genre, Resident Evil 4 is the perfect blend of modern-day action and classic survival horror. Originally released for the Nintendo GameCube in 2004, Resident Evil 4 has aged exceptionally well. The mechanics do not feel outdated, and the graphics are sharp without appearing visually painful as has been the case with some other HD re-releases on Steam. Even ten years after release, Resident Evil 4 will still command your attention! Highly recommended!",Recommended
"This is one of the best games ever in the history of ever. The Steam version is the 5th time I've bought the game, and I've played through its various incarnations 20-30 times.",Recommended
"This game is probably the best game i've ever played. I don't know why, but other games i'll only play through once or twice. This one though, i've beat it at least 10 times on PS2, Gamecube, and 360 each, and I hope to continue that with the PC version. The story is fantastic, the gameplay is amazingly fun, it is just an all around fantastic game. I really would reccommend it to anyone. It truly has the most replayability that i've ever seen in a game. I know I have alot of games I say are my favorites (Assassins Creed II, Kingdom Hearts, Deus Ex, and more) this is the only one I can play over and over without getting bored of it.\n\nIt also has a good amount of unlockable content, such as; costumes,weapons, modes(mercenaries, Assignment Ada, Seperate Ways, etc.). The game is reasonably challenging on the normal difficulty, but it really kicks it up a notch with PROFESSIONAL difficulty. Thankfully, the game allows you to start every game with your old weapons, so it's still fun.\n\nMy only complaint is that EVERY boss can be one shotted with a rocket launcher. It just seems dumb to me. But, it doesnt detract from the game, so who cares.\n\nOverall i would give this game an 11/10. Easily the best game I've ever played. Now, if only they would put all the other older ones on here.",Recommended
"The same Resident Evil 4 that I've known and loved for all these years, but that is not to say PC port is without problems.  The HD graphics do look good and their is a noticable improvement over previous releases, but at times the game is plagued with lighting effect issues.  Along with this the game now has to the ability to run at up to 60fps.  This looks amazing if your machine can handle it.  However, operating at 60fps seems to disrupt some of the enemies AI.  It's not uncommon for enemies to get lost or spin around in circles in the middle of a fight.  Yes, this makes the game easier, but it also cheapens the experience it at times.  At 30fps, this doesn't seem to be as big of an issue.  Thankfully, I've been able to avoid the majority of problems people seem to be experiencing so here's a summarize this PC port of RE4:\n\nA brilliant game as it has always been and a joy to play from start to finish if you put aside the occasional quirks that come with playing at 60fps.",Recommended
"This is one of the best, if not the best, Resident Evil games out there. The game is nearly 10 years old and it's still as moody and creepy as when it was first released. However, if you've played the Gamecube version you'll notice this PC version lacks a bit of dynamic lighting that was present in the original game. It makes the game a tiny bit less creepy, but just a tiny bit. The PC version makes up for it with 60fps gameplay and mouse support. The mouse support is pretty awful however, so I connected my controller within minutes. Playing with a controller still takes a bit of getting used to, but it's so much better than playing with a mouse and keyboard. Except for the aiming, of course.\n\nYou aim with the red laser on your pistol and because your character and gun sway it can be difficult to make precise shots. Ammo is limited, so you have to be careful with it and make sure that every shot counts. Even if that is pretty much impossible. Treasures can also be found on the islands and they can be sold to a salesman that sells upgrades and weapons. He does not sell ammo, though. And that's a good thing, because it would've made it an action game instead of a survival horror game. I thought it was all perfectly balanced; I almost always had enough ammo to kill enemies and never too much (ok, there might have been a bit more ammo near the final boss).\n\nRE4 is also responsible for the revolutionary over-the-shoulder camera view, which puts you right behind the character and with it adds that special layer of tension and immersion to the game. Brilliant stuff.\n\nAlso, I'm glad I finally managed to finish the game, because I never was able to finish it on the Gamecube. \n\nYour quest is long and will take you a minimum of 16 hours to complete. After that you can play the extra missions that were present in the PS2 version. The game never got boring (unlike RE6) or too scary. Like I said before, it is perfectly balanced.\n\nThe graphics still hold up, even if a lot of textures are blurry. There's still an amazing amount of detail to be found in the environments and characters, and let me remind you that this is an old game. I'm not talking about the upgraded textures here. I'm impressed the Gamecube was even capable of displaying this back then. The fact that the PC version now has the ability to show the game at 60fps makes it even better. Controls feel more responsive (QTEs are the exception here) and the gameplay is an even smoother experience. The sounds are still awesome and add to the creepy atmosphere of the game. Even the voice acting still holds up, but note that there are still a few corny lines here and there. Nothing that detracts from the experience if you ask me.\n\nRE4 is an excellent game that still holds up to this day, and if you never had the chance to play it before, now is the time. There's no excuse to not play it so off you go.\n\n[Rating: 92/100]",Recommended
"""The Ultimate HD edition"" it lives up to it's name. This game works perfectly with both controller and mouse and keyboard. \nA survivial horror game that delivers on the survival. The vast need for ammo and save points keeps you going and when you find one, you'll be the happiest person alive. \nThe rush of Resident Evil 4 is like nothing I have ever experienced. With a story that may seem cliche', 'Save the presidents daughter' but you start to feel for both the main characters, Leon and Ashley as they go through the game trying to get off the island that is overrun with a destrucrive and infected cult. \nNot interested yet? How about some quick time events, gorgeous cutscenes, an atmosphere that will leave your spine tingling. \nAnd what about the sound of a chainsaw from the distant knowing the person holding it, is out to cut your head off? \nI recommend Resident Evil 4 to anyone and everyone. It's known as the 'last Recommended Resident Evil' and believe me, it's one of the best.\n\nJust play it.",Recommended

"Many of you are probably already familiar with the game. RE4 is the turning point of the franchise. Capcom decided to change the way you play the game simply because REmake and Zero didn't sell well (GameCube). For the first time Resident Evil was fully 3D with behind the shoulder camera. Many people loved it and called it the best RE ever made, many people hated it and said that it's the reason behind the downfall of RE series, others liked both old and new. Will you like it? That's for you to decide.\n\nJust like in my other REviews I'll make a list of pros and cons. This time obviously I'll compare it to both oldschool and newschool REs. So, here's a list of alphabetical pros and cons:\n\nPros:\n-Camera. It's been finally patched and now you can choose between classic and centered camera. Whatever you like the most, that is.\n-Characters. RE4 features characters we already like [spoiler](especially Wesker, heheh)[/spoiler] and introduces bunch of new cool ones.\n-DLCs. RE4UHD features all available extra content there is for free! Separate Ways, Assignment Ada, Mercenaries. No need to buy them.\n-Enemies. New undiscovered enemies add extra scare factor.\n-Graphics. The game now runs in 1080p @ 60fps. there are some extra effects such as motion blur, post processing. The game's main story features real time rendered cutscenes.\n-Melee. Now you have a knife that doesn't take inventory space. Also now you can do special moves (basically coup de grâce but they're not always lethal).\n-Mercenaries. RE is well known for it's mercenaries mode in which with the given time limit you kill as many enemies as possible. It's a really fun mode and everyone should try it.\n-Mods. You can expect to see model, texture and even ambient effects mods!\n-Puzzles. Just like in old times there are few puzzles mixed in.\n-Replay value. The game has a decent replay value, especially with extra items you can earn, plus it allows you save all your end game's equipment and transfer it to a new game (obviously within borders of one difficulty).\n-Single player. ~70% of the time you're alone which is (of course) better (and more scary) than being with someone.\n-Soundtrack. The game features a good soundtrack. \n-Survival Horror. Still somewhat scary.\n-Upgrades. You can upgrade your weapons! A really satisfying (but less realistic) feature. And as an extra you can attach thing to your weapons (stock, scope).\n-Variety of weapons. Knife, handguns, shotguns, rifles. magnums, TMP, bowgun, RPG, mine thrower and other bonus weapons!\n-Weather. Unlike in previous installments which had almost static weather (always night) RE4's weather changes with the areas/chapters.\n\nCons:\n-Characters. There are few characters people would like to forget about. Mainly [spoiler]Salazar[/spoiler] and [spoiler]Ashley[/spoiler].\n-Controls. Might be one of the biggest problems here. I'm not saying that the controls are bad. They're were OK when the game was released and still can be mastered. However, the horror that is crafted by the expense of the controls is a matter of discussion. You can't dodge or counter, the controls are tanky, but now there's finally a native mouse support.\n-Enemies. There are no beloved zombies. Only parasite (Las Plagas) controlled humans and other species.\n-Escort. ~30% of the time you have to escort a person with you. Sometimes you can hide him, sometimes there's no other way but to fight with him. It's possible to accidentally kill this person (enemies can kill too, y'know) which will result in ""Mission Failed"" screen.\n-Graphics (and Performance). RE4UHD allows you to play at anti-aliased 1080p, 60fps. That's pretty much it as the ""HD"" textures are ...erm... ""Capcom HD"" as in barely HD at all. There's a big inconsistency going on when there are extremely old blurry together with higher res new ones. Also one more thing should be mentioned. Some textures look more cleaner than the old ones aka less scary.\n-QTEs. The QTEs here are unforgiving. They give you somewhere around 1.5 seconds to react and some of them require great button mashing skills.\n-Story. Barely any.\n\nI can't remember everything, so excuse me if I forgot something.\nI tried to make the pros and cons list [b]bias-free[/b], but it seems like I did not satisfy the fanboys.\nFinal verdict: it's a love/hate relationship. So play the game and see it for yourself.",Recommended
"I remember buying the PC version of this game years back, but I never got to play it simply because of the horrifyingly terrible controls. This time around, all keys are rebindable, you have a good amount of graphics options, and an option to switch between fixed 30 FPS or fixed 60 FPS gameplay. The problem, however, is that this game has game-crashing bugs that are usually linked to the whole switch-between-different-FPS options, so if you're crashing at one particular area, you might want to dial back to 30 FPS.\n\nNow, on to the review. I can see why people love this game so much and claim that it's one of the best games out there. They're not kidding. Unlike other games, which claim to be ""Recommended survival horror games,"" this game portrays this genre most accurately. You're given a bunch of guns, a knife, and a trustworthy merchant in your fight against a large cultist group in a desolate region of Spain. The game tests your ability to manage resources efficiently, as it does a great job at sucking away all your ammo. This is not your average shooting game. Bullets aren't found everywhere. They're rare. So rare that, in fact, every shot you miss, you will feel that loss. If, at any point, you manage to stack up a lot of ammo, you still cannot be trigger happy. You must be greedy with your rounds, because later points in the game will demand a lot of ammunition. The merchant does not sell you ammo. You must survive on your own. Although the knife is helpful at taking out unarmed enemies, it is virtually useless against enemies with melee weapons of some sort. This doesn't mean that you shouldn't use it at strategic points. It helps conserve ammo for later.\n\nAnother survival aspect done perfectly well in this game is medicine. You may heal yourself using various different object, such as eggs and herbs, and you may increase your maximum health permanently via the use of yellow herbs. Although encountering herbs is is more common than finding ammo, therefore making it less stressful, you must be careful not to be hit. Medicine becomes a bit rare later on. Additionally, yellow herbs are few and far between, so it may be problematic to increase your maximum health. This will however, greatly increase the efficiency of medicine that fully heal you, regardless of your health. The merchant is able to sell healing items, but they aren't cheap and he generally provides very few medicine, so he isn't a reliable source.\n\nSpeaking of which, the merchant will be extremely important. He sells treasure maps which mark the location of every treasure in a given area. Don't treat that as a rip-off: the map is cheap, there are many treasures, and most of them pay large sums of money, so it will be very beneficial to buy a map. The merchant also sells weapons to you and allows you to upgrade them. You must know which weapon you like better, because soon you must spend a good chunk of money upgrading that one particular type, and you'll only get half of what you spent if you sell it. As an example, I am using a Riot Shotgun, a Semi-Automatic Sniper rifle, and a Red9 pistol. I used a Blacktail pistol and put a lot of money into it, but it yielded little firepower and it wasn't as good for me as the Red9 was. It was very costly to sell the Blacktail and specialize the Red9, and almost went bankrupt.\n\nA central mechanic to the gameplay is QTE's. Sure, people hate them, but I think they're rather nice in this game. They aren't particularly hard either, and use few buttons in total throughout the entire game. These QTE's appear not only in cutscenes, but also in the gameplay itself. In the main game, QTE's appear usually when you're trying to dodge an enemy, or when you can kick a staggered enemy. It's also necessary when you need to break out of an enemy's grip. That QTE in particular is difficult, because you recieve a lot of damage during the grab while you have to shake the mouse frantically to try to get out of their grip. Believe me, it takes a lot of real strength to shake the mouse enough to break free, and by then, you may either be half dead or completely dead.\n\nIf there is one thing I don't like, it's the fact that this game is a massive escort mission. The president's daughter, Ashley, is kidnapped and you must rescue her. After you find her early on in the game, it is immediately evident that she will be useless. You cannot give a gun to her so she can defend herself. She cannot use a knife.  She is very vulnerable, such as generally having less resilience to blows than Leon (the main character), and being able to be captured by nearby enemies. Explosions seem to do significantly more damage to her, too, so you must be extremely careful in the world that Ashley does not get hit. On a positive note, you're able to tell ashley to stay in a certain spot, or even hide in an object, which renders her complete invincibility from all elements until you ask her to come out. You cannot do this forever, because you must leave areas with Ashley behind you, and you must catch her for every single ladder drop. Not all sections require Ashley's presence, though, which may come as a great relief.\n\nI think that about covers the entire game in a nutshell. All in all, there's a lot to be had in this game, and the campaign can last roughly 20 hours. This is well worth the $20 price tag, but I would first highly recommend going over to the steam forums for this game to see what kind of problems are associated with this game. Some problems are specific to certain systems, so you would do yourself a great favor is you check out the forums and find solutions to all problems. The only problems I have had is the game freezing at specific areas, and that is fixed by going 30 FPS (which is annoying, but whatever).\n\nIf I had to rate this, I would give it a 9/10. The point off is Ashley and the game not being fully optimized.",Recommended

"I played RE4 on the Nintendo Game Cube for many years, and i fell in love with what i would consider; the last REAL RE game.  Now that I own it on the PC in HD, I am absolutely in love again.  This game has lots of action and an enthralling storyline that will captivate your imagination to the fullest.  The graphics are gorgeous.  Those that are experiencing problems with HD should just tweak with their video settings in the game.  No big deal.  It also helps if you have a high end graphics card (which i do have).  You're gaming people; start upgrading your hardware for goodness sake.  I had this issue only when recording my action scenes on 60 FPS.  It's my recorder that has a problem, not the game itself.  Once i lowered it to 30 FPS, i had no problems with video and audio synching together.  Without recording, I can up the FPS once again and my game runs just as smoothly as before.  As far as the controls, well, I use the 360 Controller, and it does take some getting used to.  But once you get the hang of it, you're gonna be kicking butt.  No regrets here folks.  I highly recommend this game to all hardcore RE fans out there.",Recommended

"Stil a great game after all these years, and challenging as well. This game is not easy and not for anyone who enjoyed RE6, as they are leagues apart. The horror elements are strong and pop up everywhere and the game handles survival well enough by pitting you against enough enemies with limited supplies, and expecting you and a partner to survive. The puzzles are decent and still prevalent, the shooting is stellar, the mechanics of the game have enough action to stay interesting, and most deaths wont be cheap, minus the QTE that this game spawned in the series. This game is easily head ans shoulders above its series' counterparts and a Recommended highlight of a Resident Evil that kept Recommended to its tank-like survival horror style and the sequels which were inspired by the Recommended life of Michael Bay. This game earns itself a perfect 10/10, and you should play it, if you haven't already.",Recommended

Quite possibly the best in the series. Just buy it. Seriously.,Recommended

"The mouse and keyboard controls might seem a bit awkward compared to later installments in the series, but if you can get past that(and provided that you survive the glitches some people apparently have been having), you're in for one of the hands down best action-horror games out there. The game has aged incredibly well, and the HD textures are a very welcome addition. Just remember to knife crates twice when opening them and you'll be [u]mostly[/u] fine.",Recommended
"Resident Evil 4 is the 12th game in the Resident Evil franchise (including spinoffs) and was originally released back in January 2005. The game follows the protagonist Leon Scott Kennedy who originally debuted in Resident Evil 2. Leon is given a mission to find the daughter of the U.S. president Ashley Graham, who has gone missing and goes into a rural village in Spain. Once he makes his way to the village however, he meets up with hostile villagers who are all apart of a cult known as ""Los Illuminados"", which is ""The Enlightened Ones"" in Spanish.\n\nThe story is pretty well done for what there is, there were a lot of twists and turns to keep me entertained and I was never able to predict exactly what would happen next with the exception of a few scenes. Although the writing at times is kind of goofy.\n\nI'll just get this out of the way now, yes the PC port is good, it doesn't have all the graphical options I would hope however but does it's job and includes higher quality textures which makes it stand as the best version of Resident Evil 4 out there at the moment.\n\nThe gameplay is very different from previous entries and adapts a third person over the shoulder view. This gameplay was very innovated in third person shooters back in 2005 and still manages to hold up. The shooting is very well done, the guns have just the amount of punch needed to make them feel satisfying. There's are a nice number of weapons ranging from pistols, shotguns, Sub-machine Guns, Rifles, grenades, Magnums and even an RPG-7. All of these weapons with an exception of the Rocket Launcher can be upgraded to increase their damage, reload speed and ammo capacity.\nAlong your journey you'll also find herbs which come in 3 different varients; Green, Yellow and Red. Green increases your lost health, Yellow increases your total health, and Red herbs refil your health to 100%. However the Yellow and Red herbs must be mixed with a Green herb to work, you can combine all 3 herbs to create the best healing items in the game.\nAs you collect items and purchase new guns, you'll soon realize that your inventory is filling up, the inventory system is basically Inventory Tetris where you rotate and place items in specific blocks to try and fit as much stuff as possible in your inventory. As you progress the Merchant will have bigger inventory cases to store all your stuff in, along side other new firearms. I think this Inventory system is perhaps my favourite inventory system in a game. Oh yeah I nearly forgot to mention the Merchant. The merchant is a mysterious character who isn't really given any backround information, however he owns a large arsenal of weapons enough to start a war, you can buy weapons, first aid kits, sell him valuable treasure you've found, upgrade your weapons and even take you to a shooting range to earn bottle caps. I think this Inventory system is perhaps my favourite inventory system in a game.\n\nAlong the way you will also fight a couple boss fights throughout the game, these bosses are threatening and are difficult to take down, however a few of them are a bit underwealming.\n\nIf I had 2 gripes about the game, it would be the Quick-Time Events and escorting Ashley Graham.\nThe quick-time events are beyond terrible in the PC port atleast, many times when I would actually hit both X and C when I was given the prompt and successfully done so, it still counted it as a failure and made me restart from the checkpoint or lose valueable health which makes me incredibly angry.\n\nThe other issue is Ashley Graham, if you've played Resident Evil 4, you'll know what I mean. Her A.I is mostly good, following you and staying in the position you want her to when you tell her to. However many times when she is following me she stands right infront of a zomb- oh sorry I mean ""Cultist"" just begging to be hurt or kidnapped, and her constant screaming ""LEON HALP PLS"" is annoying. Thankfully you can make her hide in trash containers to give yourself all the time in the world to kill your enemies without risk of her being attacked or kidnapped.\nI also have to mention that the game isn't really scary, I've never been scared once in the entire game which is unfortunate but not really an issue in RE4. Even though it's not scary, the atmostphere is extremely well done.\n\nThe graphics have gotten a HD treatment and it still looks great. The game runs at a crisp 60 frames per second, but you can change it to a fixed 30 frames if you want. The only problem I had with the frame rate is that when I exit a menu usually at times where there were no threats nearby, it would drop to around 10 fps for a short time which never subtracted the experience for me.\n\nSound wise it's equally as good as the visuals, the guns all have their nice gunshots, the voice acting is well done, the music is excellent, and the environmental ambiance and sounds of the enemies is extremely well done.\n\nOnce you've completed the main game you unlock extra modes such as mercenaries mode which is a mini-game where you kill as many enemies as possible in a time limit to earn high scores, and Seperate ways which is a story expansion which follows Ada Wong. Plus you get extra goodies such as an infinite rocket launcher in the main game and unlocks a harder difficulty called ""Pro Mode"" which makes the replay value quite high.\n\nOverall, Resident Evil 4 is probably one of the best and funnest Survival Horror games I've played in a long time.\nThe game hasn't aged a bit, and still maintains tight controls, quality sound, fantastic gameplay mechanics, and so on. The game is length too, clocking in 12 hours and 30 minutes, however your play time will increase due to the seperate ways expansion and the replay value of the main story.\n\nResident Evil 4 is not just the best Resident Evil game, it's also one of the best games of all time.\n\n10/10",Recommended

"[i]For my full review, read the article I wrote here:[/i] [url=http://blazekick.com/resident-evil-4-ultimate-hd-edition-review-pc/]BlazeKick.com review[/url]\n\nResident Evil 4 is probably one of the most recognized and renowned survival horror games in history. With this in mind, I've actually never played it very much at all. I jumped on the opportunity to play this game on PC in what they called the ""definitive version."" I was not disappointed.\n\nReturning fans will enjoy the updated graphics, though they should not expect current-gen graphics. Most of the textures are mainly just given a spit-polish; this is to compensate for current computer specs (like widescreen support and higher resolutions). The options allow you to choose between the original graphics and the new HD graphics, improved motion blur, various post-processing shaders, etc.\n\nThe gameplay, in all directions, have been left alone. Don't fix what isn't broken, right? The PC controls feel very fluid, and players that prefer using a controller will feel just fine with the Xbox controls, as well. Other controllers (like a PS3 controller being emulated through MotionInJoy) are also responsive, although the buttons are just listed as their designated numbers.\n\nYou can upgrade and buy your weapons at the merchant, play a little shooting range mini-game for some cash, and various other quirky things that make this game feel like it legitimately progresses. I didn't feel any slow moments after the beginning; they constantly threw new things at me and I loved every minute of it.\n\nNothing in the game has been streamlined; this includes the Ashley sequences. Don't get me wrong, I understand that everyone has their preferences, but I don't understand the hate behind the escort sections. They were fine to me, but that's just me, I suppose.\n\nThe level design is incredible. With an open-world dynamic to each region, players can explore to their heart's content. The game features few branching paths, but a few extra things that require various things to access, like Ashley.\n\nThe sound is updated to fit a higher quality standard. Not much worth of noting here, but potential buyers should be warned that the sound can desync from the video at times.\n\nOverall, the game gets a ""must-buy"" from me. For $20 USD, players get a game with an incredible amount of replay value and extra content.",Recommended

"This review will focus on the overall quality of the port and ""updated"" textures.

Highly recommend a Xbox 360 controller.\n-The Separate Ways side story still has the terrible looking pre-rendered cutscenes\n\nOVERALL GAME\nPros:\n+Great production quality and still holds up\n+Great boss battles\n+Varied enemy design\n+Very balanced diffculty curve\n+Music and over all graphics are very good\n+The game play is till top notch* and satisfying\n+Pretty long game, and play time can vary tremendously on how well you play\n+Ton of content and replayability\n\nCons:\n-The controls are very dated and takes time to get used to\n-Ashley is an idiot.\n-/+The story is not really that engaging, but the lore behind the village people and the infection is pretty interesting\n\nI'd say if you can get passed the controls you will have a awesome time with this game; RE4's focus is primarly the game play, so its very hit or miss if you will like it. I don't think any issues on the behalf of the porting job should detract you from enjoying it.",Recommended

"What can I say, its Resident Evil 4, a classic for those that owned Gamecube and PS2. Now the game is exactly the same way it was on the consoles, including all the extras such as: Seperate Ways, Assignment Ada, and Mercanaries. Although the game claims to be Ultimate HD, its really not. The textures are improved for sure, and the gameplay is at 60 FPS which is amazing, BUT because of the age of the game there is only so much that Capcom can do without re-making Resident Evil 4. As for those that claim the game is a bad port because of crappy mouse + keyboard controls, they are just idiots that never played RE4 on the Gamecube or PS2. This game was designed with ""tank controls"" in mind, meaning that the camera DOES NOT CONTROL Leon's movement in any way. You do not use the mouse to turn Leon while holding down W to move forward. This is how the original game was designed, and for PC gamers this may take some time to get use to it, since we intuitively use our mouse to turn our characters ingame. The mouse is just used for aiming while in ""aim mode"". All-in-all this is a great port, and I highly recommend this game for all Resident Evil franchise lovers, or anyone in general that enjoys this genre.",Recommended

"I give it 4.5 out of 5. (1= Bad, stay away; 2= not recommended; 3= average; 4=I liked this, you should try it; 5=One of my all time favorites). This was one of my all time favorites back in the day, and with a few nitpicks, I think it still holds up very well. Longer than I remember (probably 24-26 hours of playtime, my actual completion time was 28 hours). There are only two real detractions; one is the Resident Evil ""tank controls"" - you can aim freely with the mouse, but there is no strafing, A and D rotate you left and right. This can be pretty annoying in some circumstances, as it makes it very hard to avoid enemy attacks sometimes, and also when you go to aim your gun, you may find that you were pointing in an unexpected direction. This is fairly minor however (you get used to it).  \n  A greater problem is the frequent use of quick time events with random button presses. In this version it isn't as bad (for the most part I had much more trouble with the Wii version, though maybe I had a bad remote), the button press is almost always X+C or LMB+RMB, the latter of which I often ended up succeeding at accidentally (RMB is aim, LMB is fire). However there is one spot where something seems to be off in the timing window - the jump at the end of the mine cart section I think I failed 50+ times. At the time I was extremely frustrated, but once I got past that one I had no trouble, even the infamous QTE duel with Krauser I passed on the second attempt.\n  Also the dialog/writing is not exactly great (but no surprise there), and some of the lip sinc timings go out of sequence.\n  This game has interesting level design and enemies, tons of stuff to collect, and lots of bonus content I haven't even gotten around to playing. While I have highlighted the flaws above, let me just say that it is all heavily outweighed by the positives. This is a fun game, now consided one of ""the classics"" by many, and you should definitely give it a try.",Recommended
"Besides the delay filled cutscenes and the assraping frame lag when theres too many particles and/or when using the Sniper Rifle, its well worth the $20.00 you pay for it. If you're very anal about cosmetics and performance maybe wait it out until they throw out some patches to fix theese issues, or if you're not stupid like me and you can actually tweak your settings to improve performance, do that instead.\n\nAnd I highly reccomend playing it with an Xbox360 controller, If possible. I've been instructed by a friend that the Keyboard/Mouse controls are sluggish and stupidly bound.\n\nAll in all, fun as fuck, I'd give it 7/10. The score would be higher if those damn video faults wern't there QQ",Recommended

I really cannot say i like the idea of the controlled enemies by las plagas while its a cool idea in theory i thought the regular zombies produced alot more fear, also the soundtrack is just decent compared to the ones dones in re2 re3. but this is coming from a huge fan of the classic RE games.",Recommended

A new option has been implemented, where you can choose between classic controller setting (for controller users) and modern (M+K users). Although I still experience fps drops frequently, they are less severe, only lasting a second or two, and usually when I'm not fighting someone (and yes, my specs are well beyond the recommended configuration).

On the Gamecube that is, i'd argue that its a superior version compare to whatever buggy shoddily made mess this is.

It would constantly piss you off, wondering who was talking what.\n\nThe Fucking controls.\nby god i have never ever seen such a fucked up control set for a Third Person Game. The Menus run horribly and aiming towards a headshot, man your literally better off stitching your own nipples together and ripping them off in the pure fury of the Mouse Lag.

"Resident Evil 4 returns after 9-10 years of it being almost forgotten! Thank goodness capcom thought of remaking and reviving the old, loved games as their next move to have time to create a GREAT sequel that brings back the traditional, and classic resident evil style of play.

"Nostalgia at it's finest. You get a remastered version of the game plus ""Seperate Ways"" for only 20 bucks. You can't beat that. The games shades and textures definitely make the game feel brand new again. 60 frames keep it fast-paced and will keep you on your toes while still looking smoother than ever. Playing with a controller is a must seeing as how the keyboard and mouse controls feel too rigid. Keep post process quality off unless you want the game to run like like a one-legged dog with a vestibular disorder. If you experience any lag you may need to adjust the anisotropic filtering. I found it strange that the subtitles option was locked at 'off'. No matter. I highly reccomend this port for Biohazard veterans and newcomers alike. Steam definitely redeemed the PC version of Biohazard 4 on this one. 10/10",Recommended

"Okay so first off I love RE4 and before you discount my opinion simply because of the lack of time played I sunk HOURS into this on PS2 and love the game but this is not worth buying at all right now. The game runs very poorly. I exceed all max requirements for this game and I get performance issues and low frame rate even after turning every setting as low as possible. The game doesn't actually show all of the possible controls when using the keyboard and if you use a laptop and don't have access to a controller then a lack of number keys means you can't even rotate items in your inventory which is actually a fairly improtant mechanic of the game. Additionally their is no way to remap keys on either keyboard or controller (I have been told there are but mine seem to be bugged, or maybe I am being lied to?) change mouse sensitivity, you can't even turn subtitles on/off. In short this is an absolutely amazing game that was given a terrible PC port once and had a chance to change that with a rerelease on Steam (BTW HD is not how I would describe the graphics at optimal settings) and failed yet again. Buy this game if you can. Just don't do it on PC. At least not until the game is heavily patched and/or modders fix everything the developers were to lazy to fix themselves :/",Not Recommended
"(****Those that have already played the original game need not read the first 2 paragraphs, though you can if you want, TL;DR at bottom..****)\n\nHands down the best survival horror game of all time. What at first may seem like a hopelessly clunky control scheme you'll come to love, as you gradually realize it's what makes the game unique and challenging. There's neverending action with its interactive cutscenes (I've played the game a million times and they still catch me off guard sometimes...), and the RPG elements with path choices and weaponry allow you to choose how to play the game, sniping your enemies before they know you're there, or mowing them down with your TMP. Just remember to use your ammo wisely! Plus, RE4 has the best mini-game of all time: its inventory system. They somehow managed to make organizing fun.\n\nAs for story, I'd say they did a great job catering to long time fans and those unfamiliar with the storyline. The narrative at the beginning explains Leon's backstory and why he ends up where he is at the beginning, but doesn't go into unnecessary detail. This is pretty much the philosophy they employ throughout the game with the introduction of other characters. Some may find the dialogue unbearably cheesy, but I personally love the way it always seems to lighten the mood (I tend to get a bit freaked out in horror games). \n\nI suppose I should also address the HD feature and PC support. There's definitely an improvement from the Gamecube version (no duh), and it's quite noticeable with things like ammo containers, but if you're buying the game simply for that, I'd say don't. Buy a game like Crysis if you're in it for the graphics. In other words, the changes aren't THAT noticeable, for the most part. \n\nBut if you're looking for a good PC port of this game, I'd say they did a good job on this one. There seem to be some bugs right now (this review is being written fairly close to the release date) but it's run pretty smoothly for me, no crashes or anything. As for the keyboard/mouse controls, they did a good job, but I still prefer the controller, though that may be because of how I originally played the game. I was kinda bummed that they don't let you fully customize the controller layout, but their presets are pretty decent. I wouldn't be surprised if the modding community eventually addresses that, however.\n\nSo if you're a longtime fan of the game, new to RE4/Resident Evil, longtime survival horror fan, or simply are interested in it, I wholeheartedly recommend you buy this game. \n\nTL;DR - Great PC port, HD graphics so-so, Overall would definitely recommend to longtime fans and those new to RE4.",Recommended
"In a word:  Disappointing.\n\nWhile the storyline is good, the controls are absolute junk.  While it uses the WASD keys for movement the mouse only pans and requires entirely too much movement even when the sensitivity is cranked up.  There is no side-to-side movement, only rotation which makes trying to look in one direction while moving in another quite awkward.  “A” and “D” keys will rotate the player but nothing to sidestep.  \n\nAiming is done over the shoulder style with a laser sight, instead of through the sights as is standard on first person shooters.  \n\nMoreover, you can not simultaneously move and shoot (or use knife).  You must aim, shoot, come off the sights, then move only to stop moving again in order to aim and shoot.  And just because you are looking straight at your enemy doesn’t mean your point of aim will be there when you do prepare to fire.  Expect to have to furiously pan around at times to figure out where your view rotated to.\n\nFor those that have previously played the game on consoles and are looking forward to awkward controls, movement, and aiming, you may enjoy it.\n\nFor someone who is used to more traditional controls and movement found in first person shooters, pass on this.  The unintuitive controls truly make for a miserable gameplay experience.  Instead of fighting enemies you spend your time fighting the controls.  \n\nSo as a result, the game has an entertaining storyline, but it is lost to the cumbersome controls that should have been updated to reflect the standard keyboard and mouse setup of a PC.",Not Recommended

"The game itself is great, there's no arguing that. The main problem however, lies in how it handles on the PC. It's incredibly sluggish unless you turn down you resolution to at the very least 1280 x 720 and is  sometimes unresponsive during quicktime events (when using a gamepad). While I do recommend this game overall, be wary. Hopefully Capcom will release a patch for it and soon.",Recommended

"Well, this port is better than previous one, but it doesn't mean it is good port. Graphics are really pimped up, but... not everywhere. There are buckets of old, low res textures! Good thing is support for wide-screen and HD-resolutions, but... this game have almost 10 years and no resolution will help here - this game needs new models to look good.\nCutscenes. No comment. Something like 240p on YT. \nControls are better, but still not good. RE5 have awesome control schemat, very precise crosshair, strafes, dodges, but RE4 not. Yup, I know, this is only HD version of RE4, but if you are changing controls, you could add some new features. No strafe, A and D are rotating character - mouse is useable only to target your enemy. DEAL WITH IT, because you can't change it. Still, it hurts :/\nWhere is freakin' manual? How do I rotate my weapon in case? Ah, Backspace to take item and DEL/PGDN to rotate, that was so... simple? Gosh :/\nAnd system requirements. I have overclocked Quad-core CPU, 6 GB of RAM and graphic card from previous generation and I can run BF4 on medium. Why the heck RE4 HD slows down on every engine-baded cutscene and in ~10% of game? Feels like slow-motion game - Matrix or something... Well, it makes game easier, but desynchonized audio and video looks bad.\nQTE - well, I haven't died that many times while I was plaing old version. Did something changed? Rąping (from rąpe) X button on sequences, where Leon is trying to climb up are insane :/\n\nDammit, but it's still RE4! Last good game in this universum! No good graphics, but gameplay rocks. New light effects are awesome - I was scared in few moments because of them - especially while controlling Ashley - flashlight, no weapon, total darkness.

"RE4 HD edition is a really weak port. It is better than the previous PC release, but it still sucks a fat one in many aspects. The performance is completely horrible for a game that is nearly a decade old. It has this bizarre framerate limiter that can either be set to 30 or 60. It isn't regular vsync. If the framerate drops below the specified range, the game goes into slow motion and the audio drops out of sync. This would be almost forgivable if there was a user definable frame limiter (supposing there was some kind of wonky engine limitations that make such a handicap necessary), but simply chosing between 30 and 60 is a slap in the face. The game is virtually unplayable when it is locked at 30fps, and to add insult to self inflicted, rage induced injury, the motion blur option doesn't smooth things over at all. In fact, it makes it looks literally nausia-inducingly bad. \n\nI would not recommend this to anyone with a vaguely mid range computer.",Not Recommended

"This version on PC seems to work with the Controller Flawlessly.  Join Leon on his real bad day of rescuing the daughter of the president of the united states, to save the world!  All the side missions from different versions are included making the experience complete.  Played the game through with a knife and grenades, spent hours trying to melee or grenade salizar but it wasnt happening.  This game is real fun, so you can challenge yourself as much as you want.    This is pretty much the old PC release with new shinier graphics and some tweaks.  No gamebreaking bugs encountered during the playthrough, this reboot is done by Q-Loc not capcom, gotta wonder if capcom even makes games anyore.  Cant move when you shoot, the AI in this game is great, they even blow themselves up.  The Ada missions under the ""Extras"" on the menu are alot of fun.\n\nRating:  10/10  Value:  $24.99",Recommended
"Still the best game I've ever played. Some technical issues with the port though. Lip sync is off in some cut scenes, brief but odd slowdown, sometimes the QTEs do not prompt you with the buttons for the device you are using (ie, getting keyboard promps even though you've been using a controller the whole time). Nothing a patch down the road wont fix.",Recommended
"I went ahead and preordered this game because I'm a huge fan of RE4. It is probably in my all time top 5 games. In the end however I'm pretty disappointed. I hope they continue to patch and improve on this game for the PC. I've completed this game on the Gamecube, PS2 and Wii.  So far the Wii wins.\n\nI would give this game three out of five stars for the PC version. For one, serious sound issues for me.  The dialouge is entirely out of synch with the cutscenes. As far as gameplay I'm really conflicted. Part of me thinks that it's just really difficult to make that transition of WASD -- A and D being strafe left and right instead of turning left and right. This REALLY messes with me and I can't really fault the developers on that because that's just the way the game was designed. So, part of it is just getting used to the controls. However there seems to be other issues that I can't really put my finger on. I love the new textures but they certainly don't make the game.  There's something about the controls that leave something left to be desired. I feel like a 3rd rate gamer when playing this version.\n\nGranted I need to give this game some more play time.  Perhaps I just need to adapt to the controls.  As it is though, I would recommend you dust off that old GC, PS2, or hopefully if you have it, that Wii edition. Otherwise, wait for this to go on sale -- in retrospect that is what I would do.",Not Recommended

"Touted as one of the best in the franchise and my personal favorite, Resident Evil 4 finally jumps in to glorious HD. It's not a simple upscaling of resolution, the textures have all been updated with anti aliasing support. It also seems to have subtle additions. I can't be quite sure as its been a few years since I played this on the WII and PS2 but there do seem to be a few subtle changes like the Krauser fight in Seperate Ways is verry differant and a little sparring match with Krauser when fighting him and searching for the pieces to the door can happen. I've also noticed a few new treasures. Either way for only 20 bucks this is well worth it.",Recommended
"The epitome of survival horror.\nResident Evil 4 was my first taste of the survival horror genre.  I played the first few sections of it at a friends house when it came out and it made me uneasy.  I was fifteen at the time.  That's impressive.  \nI bought it for myself for PC in 2009 and loved every minute of it.\nThe game is tense, challenging and engaging.  The graphics are impressive of a game that is nearly 10 years old, and the gameplay is well balanced.  \nThe name of the game is RESOURCE MANAGEMENT.  Money, ammo, health items, etc.  Make sure you want what you buy, upgrades included.  Put a lot of thought into the most economic way to use your money and ammo, it's a big deal.  You can really screw yourself later on in the game when the boss fights are numerous and close together.\nIf you like Resident Evil, this is your favorite game (maybe)\nIf you like survival horror where you are equipped to fight back, this game is in the top five of that genre.\nBTW the 60 fps and post rendering options make this game look noticeably better in this version.\nBuy and enjoy.",Recommended

"Long overdue. Game is released in the proper version finally. It feels very good, I was afraid I remember it well and that maybe I should not touch it... But I was clearly wrong, it has better mood than current RE games and is by far better than RE6 or 5. Combat is pretty challanging and the only things that can still annoy in PC version is no mouse free look (so you basically play with keyboard and use mouse only to aim or shift camera view while standing - it is actually harder to operate when you move it while moving). This is still a small issue that dissapears fast enough, when you forget the recent RE habits. \nCan't say about any RE games that they were scary, but this is probably the only one where you STILL feel the tension and danger at all, which brings back nostalgia.\nThe weapon and items systems are very rewarding and I like the ability to choose weapons and upgrade them. \nWhile game is still great, this release should have happened a long time ago, BUT If you didn't play any RE games and wonder if you should get this or RE6, than I tell you - get RE4. I'm a big fan of the WHOLE franchise, including ALL the games and the movies (+anime), but I honestly think this is the better game. For me it's just after Code Veronica.

"If you played this game back when it was released almost a decade ago you get pretty much the same experience again, but as that's what I was looking for I'm really happy with it. If you use a controller you may need to play around with the pre-set layouts until you find one you’re happy with but otherwise it plays as you would expect it to. Well worth the price even if it’s just for the nostalgia value.\n\nIf you never played RE4 before but are a fan of the series it’s well worth the purchase to see Leon and Ashley’s story. \n",Recommended

"I’m mainly writing this for all the people out there who know about the series but never played Resident Evil 4 before. First of all, I have to say I never really cared much about the resident evil series before. I played Resident Evil 5, but at that time it was a nice one-shot action game to me, and I didn’t know any details about the series before, because I have always been a pc-gamer and just started gaming roughly around the time RE4 hit the shelves for the first time. I mainly bought RE4HD to see why virtually everybody online gave that game 10/10 and to play one of the often quoted ancestors of todays 3rd-person-shooter games. I’m guess I’m in the third quarter of the game now and I have to say that I really understand why everybody loves this game. The atmosphere is wonderfully dark and threatening, the sound really sets the right tone in nearly every moment, the art and game design keeps throwing me new surprises in the way, the story is nicely told and - most important –the gameplay is challenging. Admittedly I don’t feel as vulnerable as the beginning anymore since I bought better weapons but I still have to manage my ammunition, money, healing herbs and inventory space. But since modern action games are often way to easy to my taste, I’m really gratefully for a game that rewards me when I manage my resources wisely, but doesn’t punish me brutally when I didn’t do so at one point.\n\nAnd if you think the story is missing a good adversary, just wait until you got Ashley and reach the castle, after that the story got way more interesting.\n\nSo all in all I can really recommend this game to everybody, including people who have never played a Resident Evil Game or Resident Evil 4 before (even though I guess that this description won’t fit much gamers out there).",Recommended

Go look up a review of the original Resident Evil 4 to find out how it plays, be aware though that the new improved graphics are very system heavy, and the game runs in slow motion if you don't meet them. The controls are same as the original, so they're quite different to how modern games play.\n\nAlso be aware that it doesn't actually have english subtitles, even though the description states it does. Not a big deal for some but had they been truthful about the state of the subtitles I wouldn't have bought the game.",Recommended
"There really isn't a whole lot to say about this game that hasn't been said already. CAPCOM has not been able to replicate this one since. The very happy medium between survival horror and action, with updated, beautiful graphics (1080p at 60fps looks amazing), and more than enough content to keep you entertained for a while, still very much worth it's $20 price tag. I still recommend this game to pretty much anyone.",Recommended
Lovein it,Recommended
"This game fucking sucks.  There I said it.  I'm the only person on the planet who has their brain plugged in.  But let me detail why.\n\n1. Movement.  Holy jumping jesus.  Your ability to move is atrocious.  You move like a snail carrying heavy shopping.  There is no ability to strafe.  When you aim you don't aim where you are looking you aim in the center of field.  Moving your gun is like pulling the mouse (and I've tried the controller) through mud.  There is no excuse for this crappy movement anymore.  There was excuse for it on the PS1 because that was very early days in 3rd-person horror games.  But RE4 should have sorted these issues out.  Also the excuse that ""it's part of the way the game is"" is lame and lazy.  The game could still be the same with better controls.\n\n2. Reloading.  WIth the mouse/keyboard it only lets me reload when I run out of bullets.  Nuff said.\n\n3 Combat.  If I shoot someone in the head I expect two things to happen (even in a zombie game).  1. They go down and I see visible damage.  2.  They go down and stay down because I've removed their brain function.  When I shoot someone twice in the head and they aren't a zombie that is inexcusable.\n\n4. Story.  The small bit I've seen thus far since I can't get past the control issues is terrible for even a RE game.  The president's daughter is missing and seems to be caught in the middle of a spanish village of cannibals?  And the local police have no idea about said village?  Even though there are plenty of corpses around.  This is kindergarten writing.  And don't get me started on the voice acting.\n\nOverall this is a terrible, terrible game.  I'm sure it could be good if they had simple things like decent movement, aiming that was remotely responsive and enemies that behaved reasonably.  Don't play this until you've had the labotomy and you resemble a character from the game.",Not Recommended

However, this new PC releases fixes these issues that plagued the PS2 version and the horrible previous PC port, as it's based on the relatively new X360/PS3 version. The controls are good, though I recommend you to play it with a controller, as the tank controls feel more natural on a controller than with a keyboard and mouse (although, these work good aswell). It also sports improved textures, in-game rendered cutscenes and a more fluid framerate (except for the horrible 15 FPS Rifle animations).

"The best looking and smoothest RE4 you'll find. Textures have been improved a bit, looking almost as good as L4D2's, The keyboard and mouse controls come 2nd best to the Wii version. If you've beaten RE4 a long time ago and want to revisit it, THIS is the one to play. If you're new to it, don't judge it harshly. The controls are like a tank (old school) and the graphics still have a 2005 vibe to them but much much cleaner than before. If you haven't played any RE game before, this one is good to start with as it doesn't have zombies from earlier in the series, instead has a different plague. As of now, the game needs patch for some small issues, and a big one that's not in the main story mode. That shouldn't stop you from buying it. It's an excellent survival horror/action. Something I should note, the game's speed is tied to the frames-per-second (like an emulator). There are 2 FPS settings: 30 and 60. If you can't keep a steady 60, try 30. If you can't keep a steady 30, give up. lol.",Recommended

"I've read a lot of reviews complaining about performance and controls. \n\nSo, I will pad this recommendation with two things.  If you're having performance issues even though your rig should be able to handle the game all you have to do is change one setting, the fixed 60 fps under video settings in the option menu.  This option will force the game to run slowly in order to keep it at 60 frames.  Sadly there is no ""not fixed"" option and the only other one os 30 fps, but gameplay is more important (to me).\n\nAs for the controls, all I can say is that I would highly, highly recommend playing this with a controler.

Unless you have a Xbox controller for PC don't even attempt to play this.  The PC controls are clunky and the camera angles are terrible.  Your field of vision is very limited. I wish I could get my $20 back because I'm going to uninstall this and never play it again.,Not Recommended

"Pretty sloppy release... they literally just upgraded ""some"" of the textures and did NOTHING else. The controls feel awkward and unresponsive as always... specially compared to other resident evil tittles on steam, something they could have fixed and didn't, and the cutscenes are all out of sync. Who the hell gave the ""go ahead"" for the release of this mess anyway??? I guess I had forgotten how much of a crap this company has turned into.. crapcom.\nOn a diferent note, this game has some rampant slowdowns on AMD cards just like revelations had problems with amd cards as well... again, stuff they know are issues and still they don't do a damn thing about it.",Not Recommended

The reason why i bought this game again is Ada Wong,Recommended
"Having played every single version of this game that has been released, I can tell you that, minus a couple of little gripes that I have, this is one of the better ports of Resident Evil 4.  This game has aged very well and is still a blast to play 9 years after its initial release.  The tank controls are a little clunky and the mouse is a little unresponsive at times, but it doesn't really detract from the overall experience.  The HD textures that they added for this version of the port are nice, but they only gave the HD makeover to parts of the game.  Unfortunatly I wasn't able to play the game at 60 FPS because the game would go into slow motion every time I tried.  The game runs perfectly fine at 30 FPS and I am not sure if this is an issue with the game or if it is just my PC, but it is something to consider if you want to try out this port.  Overall, This game was a masterpiece when it was released back in 2005 and it is still very fun to play to this day.  If you still have a version of this game lying around, the partial HD makeover and the 60 FPS may not be enough to justify another purchase, but if you have never played this game before or if you don't have this game anymore and wish to relive a blast from the past, this would be an excellent choice.",Recommended

"Tentatively I recommend this. Another nostalgia purchase that didn't really pan out for me.\n\nIt would seem that some point between the last release and this one, Leon has taken all of the cocaine, and now shoots less like a S.T.A.R.S come BSAA agent and more like a handicapped child.\nSeriously - Point your gun at something, and within a couple of seconds your aim is about 2 ganados higher than where you started, making anything further away from you than a few fit pretty un-hit-able.\n\nThe new graphics tart-up looks good, but it's your typical HiDef textures on LowPoly models, looks good, certainly better than it did - but it's not *astounding*, mirrored doors and some hefty pixels are still on walls and the like. Shame that the nicest models I've seen so far are the ""examine"" models in Leon's inventory.\n\nAlso - did Hunnigan and Leon used to blink in the radio cutscenes? They don't blink in these ones. Totally dead eyes. I swear they used to blink...\n\nMaybe a couple of patches down the line it'll be good. But right now, I can't get around the fact that I just can shoot at things.",Recommended

"Ok, let me say that I would suggest this game as it is a very good Resident Evil/ Bio hazard game, possibly after the first and the second, the only other that can be rated in a good way (on console at least). \n\nthe game used to be fantastic on Gamecube and introduced the Adventure/action style of the later editions of the saga. \n\nThis game first release on pc was a nightmare, and totally to avoid, while this one has been polished in an incredible way, with inproved framerate and HD quality, the porting is still not that perfect, I had to deal with the commands, as it is clearly meant for controller, even tho the game is being released for PC, which is a bit of fail imo. \n\nI was hoping for some controls like RE6, I was somehow let down a bit from that, but the game itself is ok. \n\nWhy I would suggest it? Just because the game itself is worth the time, and the story is very good. I would rate it a 6.5(7) over 10 points.",Recommended

"An utter failure, stopped playing after only a few minutes, the game features lowdown, causing constantly out-of sync audio in cutscenes, clunky controls which feel much stiffer than those of the original (which is saying something), I suspect that the controller support transfers controller inputs to the same library that handles keyboard, so there is no real analogue feeling to them whatsoever. Green flickers before transferring into new cuscenes further breaks immersion, and makes this seem like the cash-in port that it probably is.\n\nIf you want to play Resident Evil 4, buy the Gamecube version, or hell, even the PS2 version would be far superior to this. They'll be second hand, so you're further making sure that this horrible company doesn't recieve another cent of your money.\n\nDon't buy if you were a fan of the original, this version ruins the experience, and the HD graphics do not add anything to the experience that isn't completely overtaken by the experience breaking technical issues I've described. I feel like a complete dupe for buying this game, let alone pre-ordering it as I did, and this will be the last time I knowingly give my money to Capcom for further ruining one of their best IPs.",Not Recommended

This game was one of the greatest games I have ever played. I'm glad they had finally made an HD remake on steam. Plays no different than the other Resident Evil 4's on PC. The control scheme on the 360 controller is different but you get used to it quickly. Pure Awesomeness!,Recommended
"Resident Evil 4, What more has to said? With updated textures, full mouse support (it's sort of clunky but in all honesty it just makes the game feel more like a survival horror) and 60FPS option for those who can run it. The game has been fully remastered and it is by far my favorite vversion of this game (I have bought this game for GC when it first came out, again on Wii, I searched far and wide for an unopened PC copy *Worst copy to date but you have the option of HD mods, character swapping, and model swapping* again for the Xbox 360, and now finally for the PC again but 100% remastered to be the best it can)\nAnd as much as I love this game (9.5/10) I would like to take the oppertunity to tell the game developers that my wallet is very disapointed because of you :/ really who needs to remake a game several times...? But I guess I cannot complain, you have given me hours of fun with this new copy :3\n",Recommended

"Ummm... Resident Evil 4, one of the greatest video games of all time?  \n\nWho wouldn't buy it?  \n\n\nNow on to a serious note.  There are some minor bugs.   But even compared to a Bethesda game this game works well, very well.  My hat off to Capcom personally.  Some people seem to have major issues, most have very minor issues if even that.   \n\nI for one had well no real issues.  1 CTD, 1 Slow Down, with max settings during the entire duration of the game so far.   I find the mouse aiming controls working wonderful, 30FPS setting it seems to aim faster, while 60FPS setting it's slower but easier to manage well.   \n\nQuick Time Events, are well Quick Time Events, the most Hated Thing in the game, is still my most hated thing in the game... Quick Time Events.  Controls for them take a bit of getting used to, but I only died vs Krauser 3 times which is a personal best.\n\nI have to say this is the easiest Resident Evil 4 I've ever played.  Mouse aiming truly helps a lot.  Shooting Range was a Cake Walk, getting head/knee shots is a snap.   \n\nPerformance as I said earlier for me as been wonderful, even with this 5 year old PC.   There are some minor graphic issues, noticable textures which stand out even with the HD textures being on that look bad, but common the game came out in what? Almost a Decade ago?  Even with improved textures for much of the game.  Without them it is still an awesome game and complaining about the texture quality which is obviously better than the other PC version, well complaining about it is just stupid in my opinion.    \n\nI pity anyone who complains about this game.  I think it's wonderful.",Recommended

Its really buggy and it was terribly converted. It's a good game and all, but i recommend to wait a little before getting this so they can fix it.",Recommended
"Way too much hassle for a PC remake. The game itself is great and will always be remembered as such, but this was put out there with just the intension of bumping up the graphics, clearly.\n\nFirst off, my computer cannot run anything in HD or 60 frames, so that one was useless to me, I just wanted to have it on my computer. This is not a downside of the game though; I think it's cool that they managed to have better textures and whatnot and more power to whoever can run that sort of stuff. I'm just saying this didn't benefit my experience and it's unfortunate that the 60 FPS was one of the only selling points of the game.\n\nSecond, I could not play this game with a controller because my computer does not accept the USB's of afterglow xbox 360 controllers for some reason. I was stuck with the keyboard, so I wanted to get a feel for it. With all of this in mind; I set it to easy (something I've never seen before in any version of the game). Keep these two facts in mind for the rest of the review, because the two things I've just mentioned were the only selling points of the PC remake; everything else is just Resident Evil 4... with all of the 'new' problems.\n\nI've only run through the game one time, which was on easy mode, and I noticed a few major things. I'm not sure if it was because of the difficulty, or if they just permanently programmed it like this, but some of the sections of the game were blocked off or redesigned so that you could pass them right away. My first serious encounter with this was the garden section in the castle. remember both halves of the moon stone or whatever to unlock the door and meet Ada as well as end the chapter? Well, the door was already open when I found it, and the staircase to get in the hedge maze was blocked. They actually moved the red gem for the second mask into another section of the area so that players could still get all the gems and complete the elegant mask. Other instances are getting the grail's in the castle (the king's grail is already set into place) and the clocktower when Salazar taunts you, ""I wonder if you can see us from here, Mr. Kenedy, or whatever (A brawl to get in the clocktower, shoot all the things blocking the gears, and fighting your way out turned into hitting a switch and the bridge is open, no wave of enemies on the bridge either). Again, I'm going to assume this had to do with the difficulty being set to easy, I just found it odd.\n\nThere were actual problems I've faced with this game though such as control. I'm guessing the developers just assumed everyone would play this game with a controller plugged in, because there are some, quite literally, FATAL flaws with the design. First off, the running sequences where you have to sprint away from the tumbling rock. As a first time player on this new console; I would have NO WAY OF KNOWING what the action keys were and the game did NOTHING to alarm me of them beforehand. Since I was using a keyboard, I was told to tap 'x' as fast as possible, which was easy, don't get me wrong. But remember when you have to dodge it at the end of the track? Yeah, you either get 'x'+'c' or BOTH MOUSE BUTTONS. What the hell were they thinking? I'm spending all my energy trying to mash the x key, but they want me to move my hand all the way to the inessential mouse which I've set aside in preparation 'for' said quick-time event? Bull shit. I think the worst part is having to die three times on the second rock sequence just to wait for the 'x'+'c' command because I could not, for the life of me, reach my mouse when DODGE came up and flipped me the bird. When running away from the giant Salazar statue, I had to have my right hand mashing the 'x' key and my left hand overlapping my right to hit the correct mouse buttons. It was beyond ridiculous.\n\nHere's the second issue: Unless you have a controller; you CAN'T rotate items in your inventory. I tried every button on the keyboard, spent roughly half an hour searching the key bindings (triple-checking for reassurance). So you know what that means? You can't buy the bolt-action rifle. period. It's sold to you in a way so that it's vertical, and no attache case expansion ever makes it wide enough to fit. This is stupid, not only for not being able to purchase the first rifle (which is my favorite since it's damage is insane when maxed out), but you never know how the gun will be positioned until you buy it. I eventually worked out this peculiar system where the semi auto rifle and shotgun remained on the left since they were also positioned vertically, but all of that's ruined as soon as you get a gun that's positioned horizontally like the Colt SAA (Broken Butterfly) You have to reorganize EVERYTHING so that the new gun will fit. All of the ammo boxes were horizontal, but it may sometimes RUIN your system by popping up vertically to make itself some room.\n\nNot really a pet peeve, but it was disappointing to see that the 12 achievements for the game are the exact same achievements for the Xbox 360 version. Word for word, action for action, picture for picture. The only difference is that Steam achievements don't give a certain amount of points for unlocking them.\n\nThat's it as far as negatives go, but as for positives: I like Resident Evil 4. Again, the game itself is fantastic, but this remake had issues that they weren't taking PC considerartion in to. They didn't seem to understand that not everyone plays with a controller. It's not all about graphics, guys. I'd buy it for the console before you consider it on the computer.",Not Recommended

My computer can easily handle newer games at max settings with no problems this game becomes so choppy at the first village swarm level that its nearly unplayable.\n\nI still recommand this game and I have hopes that Capcom would re-release the other Resident Evil games for PC as well!

"Honestly its nostalgic to play RE4 again.\nremember playing on gamecube, Classics man keep them.\n\nPs: Fucking chainsaw sister's!!!\nPPs: Regenerator... nuff said...",Recommended
"I'll say this now. I LOVED Resident Evil 4 and it's my favorite in the series, and I was more excited than anyone I knew for the PC release, but it was nothing but a disappointment, to be honest. For a port of a 10 year old game, it's RIDICULOUSLY demanding. I can run games that look a lot better at 60fps, maxed out settings and never encounter any slowdowns, graphical glitches or anything. People will say ""durrr get a new toaster!"" or ""your pc just suck!"". Well, my PC is only $1000 and daddy and mummy wouldn't give me money for a more expensive gaming PC like yours. This port is POORLYoptimized and for a lot of people it's riddled with slowdowns, off-sync audio, flickering textures, flickering lighting, green flickering between cutscenes, blurry text, and many other problems.\n\nAs it stands, the game has no subtitles, even though they appear greyed out and off in the options. The game has a misleading ""Return to Main Menu"". Most people can get rid of the slowdowns if you lock it to 30fps, but that defeats the purpose of getting the HD edition for PC eh? You'd have a better time getting it on your console. But with all the graphical glitches this makes this version unplayable for me. I'd be able to crack out my Wii version and have a better time with it, and it would look a heck of a lot better. No patches or anything so far, so I don't recommend this version.",Not Recommended
"The last PC port was crap, but this one...well better sorta.\n\nI'm gonna make this one short since this game has been around for a long time and it is one of my favorite Resident Evil games of all time. I'm gonna start off with the downs. I wouldn't really call this ""HD"" and reason is because the graphics look the same just some slight retextures. I can't really tell the difference since it all looked the same to me. The game is still not keyboard and mouse friendly, however, there are key customizing which is nice to have. I would highly recommend a 360 controller to play this game properly. The ups are that it supports 1080p resolution and goes up to 60 FPS. I am happy that the game's performance is outstanding, but at the same time I am disappointed the game is still unfriendly with keyboard + mouse. I'm lucky I have a 360 controller.\n\n7/10. Not the best port, but much better than the original PC port. For the 1080p and 60 FPS it's worth the $20. I still think the Wii version is still better lol.",Recommended
AWESOME AT ITS FINEST. This classic returns and looks better than ever. If you are new to this game the controls will take getting used to but once that's taken care of this game is fun as hell. I recommend this to anybody and $20 is a steal for this masterpiece.,Recommended
good game,Recommended

"I've played through every Resident Evil / Biohazard game that Capcom's spewed out from 1-6 and other series (Outbreak, Survivor, etc), but this one tops it as my #1 favorite. It's quite a lengthy experience (in a positive way), excellent pacing, treasure hunting, resource managing, minigames, and a load of extra content that triples the replayability of this game by adding various unlockables from costumes to new guns! All of this packed in a $19.99 pricetag makes it all worthwhile; especially if you pre-purchased the game because it comes with even more extras like the full digital OST.\n\nControls are a bit more difficult if you don't take advantage of the game's controller support, but it's a great way to improve your dexterity with the keyboard / mouse and I'm already rocking my foes without a controller at this point!\n\nHowever...\n...This so called 'HD' port has its share of problems.\n\nFor starters, there is no real significant graphical improvement to the game. The textures and environments look about the same as their Gamecube / PS2 counterparts, blurry and pixelated. What the hell Capcom, why are you bragging so much about SD / HD comparisons here when there really is no significant difference?\n\nPlus the game has the tendancy of slowing down like in the matrix if you play with a fixed 60 FPS setting for most people like me (playing at a fixed 30 FPS resolves the issue, but completely undermines the '60 FPS' this port brags about), which is a real problem especially when you're watching cutscenes; it desyncs the action from the voices & sound pretty badly.\n\nCapcom claims this is due to 'Hardware' inferiority, but if I can play games like RAGE or ARMA at relatively high settings with 60+ FPS, and this 'HD' port of Resident Evil / Biohazard 4 slows down when there's even a tiny splash of pixelated water from a puddle just goes to show that Capcom needs to get into gear to better optimize the game, and stop making excuses! This game is nearly 10 years old, how demanding can a game like this be?\n\nDespite these problems I've pointed out, I still recommend the game because Capcom's going to have to address the issues sooner or later considering the fact that a majority of people like me experience these issues. Plus it's still very much playable and has a lot of content for the value.",Recommended

"lol, where to start?\n\nOkay, when you get past the main menu and into the game, theres a bit of a noticiable slow down on the graphics if you have it at the max screen setting. Not gonna push this a lot cause I've had issues with other HD or recent games at max settings.\n\nHowever, cutscenes appear to have some bugs, like the opening cutscene suffered from the lag, and the reflection of leon that was support to appear on the window didn't take up as much of the screen as it should have.\n\nThen to note: there appears to be no option to go back to the main menu or exit the game after getting into the game... I had to use Task Manager to close it.\n\nIf I've managed to over look that option, please point it out to me, because it should have been on the options menu, in my personal opinion.\n\nI've played this on Gamecube before, so I know its suppose to be a good game... just got to wait on the bugs to be worked out... So I do not recommend this yet until the bugs are fixed, but after that? go ahead :P",Not Recommended
"RE4 is a very special game.\n\nIt came out in a time when survival horror wasn't a genre flooded with knock offs of more succesful games or cheap jump scares. It popularized many things, such as the third-person OTS tracking view, quick-time events, and wave-based arcade modes unlocked after the main game was completed.\n\nThe amazing score (""Serenity"" being an all-time favorite), detailed graphics (now redefined in HD and 60fps), and classic RE story style only add to the game's timeless appeal and endless replayability.\n\nSome may say $19.99 is a little steep for a game this old, but every time I pop it in (or load it up on Steam), it feels like I'm starting the experience all over again. My highest recomendations to the title.",Recommended

RE4 was a complete overhaul of the series, changing up the enemies (no more zombies but instead parasites that infect people), the tank controls are replaced by a much more intuitive and fluid control scheme (you can aim in third person, interact with the environment much more, even hunt wild animals for health replenishing items), and was a major departure from the previous games in a good way. If you're an old school RE fan like myself and on the fence about it, just go for it. You won't regret it.",Recommended

If you played Resident Evil 4 before you will love this.,Recommended
"To any fan of the original Resident Evil 4 / Biohazard 4: You must get this game. The graphic quality is so amazing that my mind was blown when I compared it to my Playstation 2 Version. The gameplay is the same, with very minor changes that make the game feel so much better. The cinematics run so smooth and fluid on 60 FPS.\n\nOverall, I would definetly recommend this game to anyone who loved Resident Evil 4 / Biohazard 4. I would recommend it to anyone who likes action filled survior games. And I would further recommend this game to anyone who love to casually play for story based games.\n\nThe rating I give for Resident Evil 4 / Biohazard 4 HD PC Version\nStory: 8/10\nGraphics (60 FPS HD) : 9/10\nGameplay: 10/10\nStrategy: 7/10\nReplay: 9/10\n\n>>>More Detailed Information Incoming<<<\n\nNow as I grew up with the Resident Evil / Biohazard games, I love them all. I prefer Resident Evil 4 / Biohazard 4 the most however. This game is one of the few games that I will speed run, play for fun, show off gameplay to all my friends, and put hours upon hours of gameplay into. That being said, when I was younger and this game first came out, I gave every aspect of this game a 10/10, but as I grow older I learn about things that could have been better, and see room for improvement. So my ratings are based now on a more level-headed scale. As I have previously stated my ratings above let me explain them.\n\nStory 8/10: I feel the story is an 8/10 because of how fast paced it is while still providing just the right amount of detail that you don't get lost. Right from the start Leon (The main character) tells the player exactly what they need to know about the previous games, and lets you feel right at home in this world. The plot twist surprise new players all the time and any story that makes people continue playing for long periods of time is obviously amazing. The ending did start to feel a bit rushed however as they had to wrap up the game for fear of making the game 3 disk on the original release for the Gamecube, atleast that is what I think happened.\n\nGraphics 9/10: Now comparing the standard defination to modern games I would say its graphics would rate about 6/10. Now this is to modern games. But with the new high defination graphics and increased framerate, the graphics have just blown my mind. I never thought this game would be able to look modern due to how old it is, but CAPCOM proved me wrong. Now obviously graphical ratings are always biased based on the reviewer, but you have to agree that the improvement from SD to HD 60 FPS is amazing.\n\nGameplay 10/10: Now this category will be up to debate. I love the survival aspect of action games. Having to manage your inventory with useful items, and making sure you don't waste to much ammo is amazing. The varying enemies constantly keep you on your toes, and the puzzles make you think. The difficulty of the game is just hard enough that it can make you angry when you mess up, and make you feel amazing when you just survived killing two giants first try. Now as I have way to many hours played on this game on the Playstaion 2, Xbox 360 HD versions AND I have been speed running this game for alittle bit, it is a bit easy for me to get through it, but I still enjoy every moment that I play this game. Now if you do not enjoy having to be patient and plan out how I am going to get through this village with a Handgun, Knife, and 25 Bullets; you may not like this game at first. My biggest tip to new players is, just take your time and play it safe. Get every item you can and don't take to much damage for no reason.\n\nStrategy 7/10: Now at first this game was really hard for me to play cause I was young at the time. I had trouble getting passed the first village because I couldn't hit an enemy standing still five feet from my face. But as I sat there and thought about, how can I save ammo, how can I use my knife without taking damage, how can I ect... I began to start getting through many parts of this game easier. Now this is not the hardest game to think through, but it offers enough challenge to make it even more fun on top of the type of play. The puzzles are hard enough that you have to think them through, but easy enough that you dont have to look them up, and when you get through them, you feel amazing and know that you, by yourself, just progressed through this game one more step.\n\nReplay 9/10: Now I love this game to death. So of course I enjoy replaying it. I mean I even speed run it for fun. (Best time New Game+ 1:49:43 :: Without Island Skip cause I suck at that) Now let me tell you why you might enjoy replaying this game. First off, nothing really changes other than the loot. After you beat the main story, Assignment Ada, Separate Ways, and The Mercenaries, you think the game is done, BUT by doing at that and even beating the game on its hardest difficulty, you unlock new guns and amazing outfits to play through the game with again. Some add different strategies to the maps, others offer more challenge. One challenge I dare people to do is Professional mode Handgun/Knife only (Upgrades not allowed). That is a hard way to beat this game. But knowing that each time you play, you will notice more and more little details that you missed or find another path to a map that makes it so much easier/harder, lets you experience this game is way greater detail. The way the maps run together and the way the enemies behavior change depending on how agressive your playing keeps this game fun and amazing.\n\nSo in total my rating for this game is an amazing 8.6/10. The biggest reason it is not 10/10 is it is an older game that has simply been updated to modern standards. Never the less, this is (in my opinion) the best installment of the Resident Evil / Biohazard games and to this day, still my favorite game ever.",Recommended

Although at the time it was exclusive for gamecube only.. it was release on PS2 also which had the addon for Ada's misson, the typewriter and the laser gun! I beat it on ps2 also and I beat it on PS3 when it was release!!! What can I say... the story is pretty much a get from point A to B gameplay. I like it thats why I brought it on 3 different type of plat form. However, I got the PC version too and i'm still not bored of RE4. A really fun game to play. \nI have to say the HD touch is really nice. The controls are easy to use although i perfer a controller. \n\n\nGet this game if you played the past and recent RE games...

"Game itself is a wonderful game but the actual way the game plays is horrible compared to its non HD original formats. Lots of probs so far from first impression play from the following so far: Mouse aiming sucks and sensitivity don't help any and in fact makes it far worse, control movements are way off & slow, video cutscenes audio and video don't follow the characters at all despite the game running flawlessly on my computer not syncing correctly. In conclusion, while the games graphics compared to the original PS2 & PC versions have been amazingly been improved and very well done the game itself is just not worth buying unless they plan on making some drastic fixes to make it playable and balanced like its original counterparts. However, if your a fan of the series and especially of Resident Evil 4 and its magnicent impression on the series its worth putting the extra dollar into to add to your collection and if not I do not reccomend buying it and sticking to the original formats on your fave consoles for the best Resident Evil 4 experience especially if your new to the game itself. Buy this one at your own risk of your allowance.",Not Recommended
"Don't expect a complete re-invention of the game you played before.   This is, for all intents and purposes,  the *exact same* RE4 you're used to.   But that's not a bad thing.  In fact,  it feels alot like this is simply the port that PC gamers should have got several years ago in place of that P.O.S Konami pushed out that you needed a bunch of mods just to be able to play.  There are some basic control and graphical settings here which were absent before ( Mouse acceleration / sensitivity , keyboard re-mapping,  anti-aliasing,  etc.)  but generally speaking, it's still pretty light on options.  Even with the updated control options the feeling of playing RE4 with a mouse and keyboard is quite clunky.   And you know what?  The more I play this game, the more I feel like that's just part of the appeal.  Your enemies are slow and clunky and so are your controls.  Therein lies a huge part of why the game is so tense.   I'm glad that RE4 finally got the treatment it deserves on PC, but for some people it will be too little, too late.  Especially if you already bought the previous RE4 port.  But if you're a huge RE nerd, this is definitely worth trying out. \n\n8/10.",Recommended

"In order to help commemorate the release of the “Ultimate HD Edition” of Resident Evil 4 on Steam this week, I figured I’d post about how awesome this game is. It's actually difficult for me to put my finger on why I like this game so much. On paper, it seems like a game I would absolutely hate. The story is pretty much ridiculous. The puzzles feel tacked on and unnecessary. There's instant death quick time events in cutscenes. All things I hate. Plus it's a shooter, and I'm not usually enthralled with action/shooters. But somehow this game really won me over and became one of my favorites. \n\nResident Evil 4 marked a huge shift in the franchise's gameplay. RE 1-3 were really more pure survival horror games. Ammo was scarce. Enemies were scarce, which made it more intense when you encountered one. Aiming was kind of awkward which gave a real sense of vulnerability. The emphasis was on atmosphere and trying to creep the player out. I liked these games, especially the first Resident Evil. RE4 is a very different kind of game. There's enemies all over the place, the controls are tight, and the emphasis is on the shooting and action. It's a different kind of fun. It still does atmosphere sort of well through the first half of the game, but kind of abandons it through the second half in my opinion. \n\nWhat I think this game does very well is variety. Variety in enemies, variety in weapons, variety in locations and so on. While I think RE4 does some sections of the game better than others, at least you never get the sense that you're doing the same thing over and over which I frequently get while playing shooters. There's the atmospheric lonely feeling of the village in the beginning of the game, the creepy cultists in the castle, the unnerving bizarre science experiments in the laboratory and the over the top action sequences near the end of the game. \n\nThere are lots of unique and memorable experiences in RE4. There's everything from being trapped in a cabin with legions of zombies trying to break in to running from an invisible monster through dimly lit sewers. There's even epic gigantic boss fights and a few vehicle sections as well. It's not as nerve-wrackingly scary as the first RE games, but there are a few jump scares scattered throughout RE4. There's a sort of fun metagame of deciding which weapons and items you'll take with you with limited inventory space. And deciding which guns to upgrade and which upgrades to purchase is fun too. \n\nIt's just good old zombie killing fun.

"Not much to say about the game that hasn't already been said over the years. Calling it a ""masterpiece"" is a bit excessive, but not unjustified. Even though I never cared about the RE series, I found RE4 to be one of the best action-adventure/survival games I've ever played. This is mostly due to some fenomenal pacing, great atmosphere, huge variety of locations, enemies, weapons, and hidden treasures, as well as a lot of replay value found in both the extensive main storyline (about 10-15 hours on average) and the arcade Mercenary mode.\n\nThat said, the game has its issues. The story and characters are laughable and uninteresting, while character and camera controls have always felt clunky and weird, regardless of what type of controller was used. This is also the case for the PC port, with mouse and keyboard controls requiring some getting used to, especially since only a small portion of the keys can be rebinded, for whatever reason. The port also suffers from some minor graphical issues, and all the ""Ultimate HD"" thing isn't particularly impressive, with some obvious poor textures found throughout.\n\nOther than that though, it's still an amazing game finally running at 60fps. Definitely worth the money.",Recommended

"This game is by far the best Resident Evil title to this day, it's the epitome of what Resident Evil is!.. And sadly what is has failed to be ever since.\n\nResident Evil, in it's core, is an action/adventure/horror game. I see it's been dubbed a ""survival horror"" game among the tags, but this isn't Recommended. There is no resource gathering, and there is no more focus on ""survival"" than there is in any other game where you can end up dead. You are Leon Kennedy, an ex cop from the S.T.A.R.S division and a veteran of the original outbreak of the T-Virus in Racoon City. In Resident Evil 4 the idealist cop from Resident Evil 2 is replaced by a more mature, perhaps cynical Leon tasked with the arguably unenviable task of saving the President's daughter from a band of cultists who, we discover 5 seconds into the game, isn't afraid to use lethal force to stop you. No pressure Leon.\n\nBut wait, these enemies aren't zombies?! Where is the T-virus, the sterile Umbrella labs, and bloody, limp corpses slowly dragging their legs behind as they approach you? Well, I guess they are back in Racoon City, being radioactive ash!.. So no, these enemies aren't your stereotypical Zombies. What of it?\n\nHere's the deal: The T-Virus, although awesome, was a virus. Viruses are imperfect in that you have no control of it's spread. A bite, a scratch, aerosol or blood in your eye and boom, new zombie. Wouldn't a parasite be better? A mind control parasite that didn't spread on it's own, didn't otherwise reproduce, and turned the infected into mindless devouts of your new religion featuring you as the God instead of mindless zombies as likely to eat you as the other guy?\n\nThis had multiple benefits: The infected can move faster, they still have a funcitoning, alive body. You can specifically control who you want to infect. They are capable of understanding concepts such as ambush and basic weapon usage. They can work individually or in a group to reach a set goal, follow orders, and know how to dodge and run to avoid being gunned down (or that's the plan I guess). Basically, these parasite zombies are more terrifying than your average run of the mill zombie, because they pose a threat in ways other than simply swarming you with sheer numbers.\n\nThe game does everything well. The environment, although creepy and atmospheric, feel a bit edgy. An not in the fashionstatement sense... There are simply sharp edges, everywhere. There isn't a single natural looking hill, slope or road in this game, but truth be told, I didn't expect anything more from a 9 year old game with new textures.\n\nSpeaking of which, the graphical update is noticable, but not in a way that actually benefits the game, or make it worth purchasing if you have an original copy somewhere. But it will probably increase chances of new players trying it out, so I can see why they chose to do it. The story and voice acting is the same, no surprises here. It's a HD re-release, not a remake or reimagining. Basically, if you played the original version, you will instantly recognize and feel at home with this one. What makes this game great is the design of the environment, the enemies and the story, especially in the first part of the game which feels much like a Lovecraft Mythos game rather than a zombie shoot-em-up, which suits me well. It's a dark, gritty world, filled with mysticism and evil. What is the purpose of the ""Stranger""? Who is he? Why is he helping? And is Sadler really using magic to summon all these creatures, or is it just variations of the parasite? How did he come across this parasite to begin with? What are his motives? The game keeps you guessing and keep the suspense up to the credit roll.\n\nThere are some gameplay issues though. It's an old game, and it shows in more than just graphics.\n\nFirst off, the game is unforgiving, especially in high difficulties. This isn't CoD, you don't have unlimited ammo, your health doesn't automagically regenerate over time, there isn't any ""cover system"" (thank God!), so you will find yourself dying. Often. Especially if you are new to the series. And although the game does come with a tutorial, it's far from intuitive, and doesn't reflect on new key bindings. The unforgiving aspect may turn some people off, but will likely trigger more people to play it.\n\nAmmo coservation is a big part of the game, because if you run out you can only defend yourself with the knife... And it isn't the instant-kill variety. The fact that the knife is so useless, especially with the controls (more on that later). Again, this adds a type of challange modern players isn't used to or has forgotten over the years.\n\nMy top most reasons for dying is this: Clunky controls. The aiming in this game is TERRIBLE. It's the worst aiming I have ever played in a third person view, ever, at least with a mouse and keyboard. The laser sight jumps back and forth, and no matter if mouse acceleration is on or off, it just never gets particularily smooth. So I miss my head shots a couple of times, and run out of ammo, forcing me to resort to the worst melee weapon of all time. The fact that the Camera moves in mysterious ways doesn't help. Some times when I push the sprint key Leon makes a 180 degree turn and walks into a zombie. Sometimes the camera shows nothing but walls when you are in a corner. If they fix smoother aiming, this classic will becomne an even better release.\n\nPros:\n+ Clever(or well, kinda clever, compares to what you compare them with) enemies.\n+ Awesome characters and environments!\n+ Doesn't have racism for legs!\n\nCons:\n+ Clunky aiming.\n+ Bad Camera control.",Recommended

"Resident Evil 4 has been my favoite game since i started playing games on PC , and now its on Steam with better video. I think this is 1 of the best games Valve has ever sold on Steam. The only problem though is that the cutscenes are slow and the gameplay moves slow in big areas of the game, but i dont know if thats me or the game itself. I still give this a 5/5 , thanks Valve :)",Recommended
"OK, I'll just say Resident Evil is fantastic in terms of atmosphere, mystery, story and setting. I really enjoy the game and have played it many times on different settings.\n\nBut, one thing that's particularly annoying NOW are the damn controls!!!  I mean, they were always a little wonkey on the PS2, but you could get used to them after a while. Now it's been ported to the PC, and the controls still SUCK!!! And how about a manual to explain the key layout? Would it really be that hard??? The mouse is laggy, even when you've got the speed cranked way up (mine's at 30), but the movemenet controls are just slow and not great. I think they could have done a much better job, and the fact is, they should have.",Recommended

I have non of the problems reported by people, such as missing textures and or slow-mo. It runs perfect and it looks really good.

"I bought this game cause it supports mouse (beside HD quality). It does support but somehow I was more comfortable playing with keyboard only. Mouse only helps you to aim and move camera around you. You still need  A and D buttons to turn. And it's confusing for a while. Even highest sensitivity feels slow. I had terrible headache because of controls.\n\nKnifing boxes is probably most used action in this game. However everytime you hold your knife it takes about a second before u can move it. I mean everytime. Thus, knifing enemy on the ground is not preferable at all. You may even want to skip some boxes.\n\nI hope they at least fix this knife issue soon.\n\nedit: I recently tried Logitech F710 controller, same result...\n\nupdate: knife issue is fixed with recent update.

"I'll preface this by saying that the only other version I've played is the Wii version, and that I play with an Xbox 360 controller.\n\nThe first time I played it, I thought it was an amazing game. Years later, and an 'HD' upgrade, I still think the same of it. It is not a perfect port, and there are issues. On the whole, however, it remains the same fantastic game it ever was.\n\nWhilst it is called 'HD', not all textures were given the same amount of love and attention. Numerous other reviews detail this, but when you see the better textures juxtaposed with textures which were not updated, it looks jarring. They touted that the text on the grenades can be read, but frankly I could not care less about this. On the whole, the textures are an upgrade - I just wish they had spent more time doing ALL the textures (or at least making them somewhat better). \n\nAnother niggle is the poor background textures during the game. This is most noticeable in the Castle area, and it's a shame, frankly. I wouldn't expect intricately detailed backgrounds, but something better than what was provided on consoles that could manage 640x480 only would have been nice. \n\nFurthermore, the frame limiters are too 'literal'. They are not caps, but actual limiters. If your computer is not capable of 60fps when you set the limit to 60fps, the game will play in slow motion. This makes it smooth, but ruins the experience. I'd rather it let the framerate drop below 60fps (or 30fps, if that's your limit) to allow gameplay to be at a consistent speed.\n\nI was never into speedrunning as a concept - I enjoy looking around and discovering new things - but with this version I decided to bite the bullet - and happily the glitches have been left in (the ones which help speedruns, but don't ruin normal gameplay).\n\nThe gameplay is as it has ever been, which is to say fantastic. Some lament the fact that you cannot move and aim/shoot, but this adds to the tension imo. Lack of a FOV option isn't too bad - I've never had problems with limited field of view (whilst some have), but I like being able to see more of what's around me) - because again, it adds to the tension.\n\nThere are some strange minor issues, but I would recommend it if you've never played it before, or if you want a better PC version than existed before. Keyboard and Mouse users may want to hold off for a while however, since some are complaining about the support for K&M setups.",Recommended
"I guess I expected a little more for a PC port.  I had to google how to quit the game.  You have to choose Game Reset -> YES, an option which makes it sound like your are deleting your saves. And the controls take a little getting used to.",Recommended

I'm not going to go in-depth with why because I feel I'd just be preaching to the choir, but it is a game that is worth playing even 9 years after its release. Do yourself a favor and check out the game that defined the era it first existed in and has continued to shine through all of its various ports (except the original PC port, we like to pretend that one didn't exist.)",Recommended

"I don't recommend you buy this. Terrible PC port with god-awful controls. Leon handles about as gracefully as an overloaded rubbish truck with the tyres let out, the mouse speed is so slow that the whole thing plays like one of those underwater dreams (even at maximum sensitivity), sometimes it dislikes it when you try to turn, and casues Leon to end up facing 90-180 degrees away from where you intended (especially in the midst of combat), and half the quick time events are broken. Also, you can't sidestep. Presumably, forcing you to run around a corner and right into that zombie/dynamite trap makes it that much scarier, but I would have to say it's just poor design.\n\nOh, and fairly mediocre plot and character development.

"TL;DR - You wont regret buying it 10/10\n\nResident Evil 4 is a Classic. One of the best Resident Evil's in the series that was released. Its always fun to go back to this game and replay it over and over. It really never gets boring. As soon as this got released i played for a good 12 hours. If you are new to the resident evil series, you'll love this one. Resident Evil 1,2 and 3 was around horror and not exactly action, and 5 and 6 were based mostly on action, and 4 is inbetween horror and action, giving a brilliant combo. You mainly have to try to conserve your ammo (depending on your difficulty) and survive. Giving it a nice survival aspect. Secret treasures and areas that reward you if you keep an eye out and the game never lets you down when you go the wrong way, instead, you get rewarded with other items, such as herbs (which can heal you, increase your maximum health depending on the herb), ammunition etc. etc. I've played this game on and off ever since its release, and its still fun to this day. Good storyline, Good Fun. 10/10.",Recommended
"A solid game that stray away from the original formula that was used in previous Resident Evil games and that we knew and loved. The third person mechanic works well to still provide that horror game feel while being a little more action based. The HD update looks very nice in comparison to the original game and allows you to immerse yourself more into the game. While it doesn't contain any zombies, it is still a very solid game that you should definitely play (or even re-play). 8.5/10",Recommended
"Resident Evil 4 still hold up after all this time. I loved this game back on the PS2 and Gamecube, and I am pleased to find my love of it has nothing to do with rose tinted goggles.\n\nAs for the port itself, it has this wierd issue where if you're running it at 60 fps and your framerate drops for whatever reason, the game slows down. It's wierd as all hell, but it's not a gamebreaking thing (unless your computer is really really REALLY old). The options also leave a bit more to be desired, but it's enough to get the job done. And the port is still functional, runs smoothly, and doesn't CTD.\n\nBottom line: It's a funcitonal, if a little underwhelming port of a fantastic game that is still a dear favorite of mine. Don't pass up on this, it's fantastic.",Recommended

"First, the game: if you haven't played RE4, it's the game that reinvented the series and set it on its tracks to mindless action shooter series, but for the case of this one game they really got it right, between the enemies, weapons, atmosphere, and controls. It's so campy and the combat is so visceral that it rarely feels like a horror game, but there's just enough challenge to keep a tense atmosphere. Almost a decade later, this still holds up quite well.\n\nNow, the port: It's passable. It's a pretty no-frills drag-and-drop job of I guess the already-HD 360 rerelease from a while ago, ostensibly with a new 60 FPS option... but in practice you may well end up having to turn down your graphics settings including framerate because either the port is HORRIBLY optimized or there's some major issue somewhere cropping up for a lot of people that's causing catastrophic slowdown. After cranking it down I was able to get a couple chapters in mostly without issue. Controls work fine despite what all the gripers are saying, gamepad works exactly as it was originally designed and M+KB works akin to the Wii port, minus the tacked-on crosshair.\n\nPresently I'd wait to see if they can hammer out the slowdown issue, but otherwise recommended.",Recommended
"I think a lot of people here writing negative reviews are all based on controls, however, I believe it isn't the controls so much as what they expected. You can compare the controls of say, the original Mario to the Original sonic, because they are both platformers. You can't really compare the controls of this game to any other game because it is a pretty unique style. I think a lot of people expected a high sensitivity FPS style control where Leon does 360s. But that's not how it was on PS2/GC so why would they change that now? Personally I have had minimal problems with controls, it just takes some time getting used to. Really the knife is the only one that bothered me and that I got used to.\nThat being said, this is the greatest zombie killing survival horror/action game ever. It's flawless, if you've never played it before, you would be doing yourself a great deed by playing it.",Recommended

I pre-loaded this game as soon as I was able, and the moment it was released I played it....or, at least I tried to. The game runs in super slow mo whenever there are lighting effects visible.

"Are you serious, Capcom/Steam? \nFirst of all, I love this game and I cannot reccomend it enough but this PORT is TERRIBLE. First off my computer can handle a lot, so the issue is with the game, not the hardware. When I first started the game, it chugged slower than a snail in molasses. I thought that this was perhaps a first time startup thing. I got to the main menu where the curser itself lagged out and it could barely move. I first went to the options and for good measure I set all the graphics to the lowest settings and all the prettiness to ""off"" to try and improve performance. It barely changed anything, even after restarting the game it churned slowly. I thought maybe just maybe the real game wouldnt be so bad... but to my suprise it was worse. The cutscene was super slow, and when i skipped the cutscene (out of neccessity in order to move past the seemingly frozen frames) I got to the first screen of the game with half the textures missing. It was all black! and Leon moved of his own accord in a small circle shooting at the ground. I checked that my controller was not plugged in and on the floor or something, and that nothing was on my computer keyboard. It seemed as if everything was going wrong.

"Despite what my play count is on Steam, trust me, I've put a whole ton more hours in on the PS2 version. I'm going to give you information on the game as from what i've experienced so far: The graphics are stunning in HD, but here's the catch: Runin 60 FPS, and you'll be feeling like it's constant slow motion. I don't know if it's just my system, but hey, Just throwing it out there. I haven't tried 30 FPS yet, but I do plan on doing that. You get CUSTOM mouse acceleration, quite a few differnet resolutions to play at... The ability to rebind your keyboard keys if you want to play the game with a keyboard and mouse. When I put the game on ""fixed 60 FPS,"" the opening cutscene became out of synch at somepoint, but yet again, I don't know if it's my own hardware that's doing that injustice. This is an oldie by now, but it's a goodie! Better than Resident evil 5, I can tell you that!\n",Recommended

This was the first Resident Evil game i ever played (back in 2005 on the gamecube) and even to this day i enjoy playing it and the new graphics are amazing. It is 100% worth the price and dont wory if you never played the other resident evil games it talks very little about the previous games if you are worried about spoilers.,Recommended
"I agree with Rock, Paper, Shotgun's conclusion that this feels like a PC port from 2007.  It's much better than the original port and it's nice and stable, but the controls are still clunky enough to give you some ""not quite there yet"" nostalgia.  \n\nFor instance, if you want to quit the game you need to go to the main menu but there's no option to do so.  Instead there's a ""reset game"" option, which literally reloads the game and brings you to the main menu as though you'd hit a vestigial reset button.  You can play it with a mouse and keyboard but it feels awkward and clumsy, and there's enough crosshair jittering that the weapon stocks are still a worthwhile investment (which was not the case in the Wii version).  After playing with M+K for a while I switched to my X360 controller, which I found to be much more comfortable.  \n\nAs for the graphics, well, it's a game from 2004.  They can toss on some filters and post-processing and slap in some higher res textures but there's only so much they can do.  This game is not look as good as Resident Evil 6.  Or 5.  Or Relevations.  It looks OK for what it is, which is a decent version of a great game.  If that's what you're looking for and you can forgive a few blemishes, give this one a shot.",Recommended

like the game. one of the best resident evils in my opinion. the controls need a lot of work. cant move while aiming and you dont move in the direction you are facing. rotaiting mouse changes view but you dont walk in that direction. plus the sync of talking and lip movement is off. almost as bad as a godzilla movie.,Recommended

"ONE OF THE VERY BEST GAMES OF ALL TIME FINALLY GETS A GOOD (NOT GREAT) PC PORT\nIf you were already a serious gamer back in the mid-'00s, you probably consider RE4 as one of the most important games of all time. Just like Gears of War, RE4 helped redefine the action-adventure shooter genre; it was a wild 3rd-1st person shooter hybrid with SWEET sniper weapons and, while it wasn't a traditional '90s survival horror game, it featured many elements of previous RE games, and it was a scary, dark game (not as dark as RE2-3 though). Sadly, the original 2007 PC port suffered from average graphics/textures and a total lack of mouse support (making aiming a living hell, yet the game was playable once you LEARNED to aim with the A-W-S-D keys-EPIC!, lol). That means the GameCube / Wii versions were the ultimate ports of RE4...until now...\nNOW we have this RE4 HD revival, and FINALLY serious PC gamers have the opportunity to play this game with mouse support and good-to-great textures/graphics. BUT BEWARE!, this HD 2014 pc port suffers from two major (or minor, depending on how good your pc is) FLAWS:\n\na) the game is playable, but needs a fix; I can play 2012-2013 games on high-to-ultra settings with no problems, but I HAVE to run RE4 HD without motion blur, anti-aliasing, and I'm forced to use 30 fps (not the 60 fps option), at least I can run it with the HD graphics, LOL!; but gamers with 2010-2011 computers will STRUGGLE to run this game even on low settings and without (!) the HD graphics\n---EDIT: GAME ALREADY FIXED AND WORKING LIKE A CHARM---\n\nb) the gameplay is EXACTLY the same as RE 5, that means you can't walk/run while aiming, and you can't really move with the mouse (too slow-awkward), so you'll have to stick with the A,W,S,D keys for movement. That kinda makes RE4 HD a bit old-school; those who were hoping for a Mass Effect 3/Resident Evil 6-like gameplay will be disappointed...\n.\n\nfinal verdict: 8,5/10 (the original GameCube-Wii game remains a solid-historical 10/10)",Recommended

Q is quickl turn, SO IS MOVING YOUR MOUSE A LITTLE BIT WHILE AIMING!!!!

"EDIT: I'm changing my rating, since Capcom took the time to fix the crappy aim the game had when you using a mouse and now I can finally properly play it with mouse + keyboard. Thanks Capcom.\n\nGame is great and I love it, but I have always wanted to play this with a mouse and keyboard PROPERLY, with controls similar or identical to resident evil 5's. This port's keyboard and mouse controls still suck and are a drag to play with, I DEFINITELY don't recommend this game to anyone who doesn't have a controller or, like me, planned to play it with a mouse and keyboard for the first time.",Recommended
"One of my favorite games of all time. Only $20, definitely worth.",Recommended

"I'm glad Capcom dropped the ""Ultimate HD Edition"" title from this game. It is far from HD. Sure there's a texture pack which gives the character models, weapons, HUD and other game critical art a nice lick of paint (special mention to the menu/game fonts, I love them), but the majority of the environment textures are stock (and yes, I do have the HD textures enabled in the options) Gamecube assets. And it shows. There's such inconsistencies, it look patchy.\n\nThat being said, it's not all about the visuals. This game still kicks major ass, almost 10 years after it's Gamecube debut. Of course, we now have full Steamworks support, trading cards and above all, silky smooth 60 FPS performance. It feels bang on when taking out the greasy Ganado's. Love it. The audio is as kick ass as ever. Doctor Salvador still scares the ever loving shite out of me as he wields his mighty chainsaw.\n\nThe ""tank"" controls, for me, add that sense of urgency when you're dealing with the plaga infected sum bitches. It's what made RE4. A nice mixture of tension (not horror, sadly), grusome gore and silky smooth gameplay. \n\nAs always, this game is best played with a controller. \n\nVerdict: Awesome. \n\nPS: The enterprising modders will make this a Recommended ""Ultimate HD"" experience.",Recommended

"Graphically speaking this game looks significantly better on an HDTV compared to the original SD GCN/Wii release. Some of the effects might be slightly lacking from the original but the improved resolution, frame rate and textures more than make up for it in my opinion (Runs flawlessly on my Nvidia GTX 660). Mouse controls are not perfect and i would still prefer the amazingly intuitive controls of the Wii release but they are at least salvagable. Mouse control seems to have a bit of a lag and the camera inconsistently snaps to the direction you are facing when drawing your weapon, rather than to the direction the camera is pointing which can make combat disorienting. Purists will probably want to stick to controller but I'm still on the fence as to whether i want to continue with M/Kb (mouse still feels more accurate for aiming). If you are looking for an excuse to revisit one of the best action horror games of all time, it's not going to get much better than this!",Recommended

"[b]The choice of an avid game collector. It's a nice game, stranger![/b]\n\n[b]Resident Evil 4 is over the shoulder action/horror/shooter with puzzle and survival elements that places you under the soft, golden bangs of ex-cop and Raccoon City survivor Leon S Kennedy, who while investigating a reported sighting of the President's recently kidnapped daughter 'somewhere in Spain' ends up having to rescue her from a cult of homicidal zom- err, mutants.[/b]\n\nOriginally planned to be a more supernatural themed Silent Hill-esque affair exploring Leon's PTSD following the events of Resident Evil 2 somewhere along the line it was decided to move focus towards action and whereupon RE4 adopted a slightly campier tone and a more original storyline distanced from established cannon. The shift divided fans, while the majority, Myself included, consider RE4 the height of the series and one of the best games of a [console] generation (not to mention a spectacular vindication for Game Cube owners) others were turned off at the outset by the empowerment of the player through more gun heavy gameplay, partially non-sequitur narrative and lack of traditional zombies.\n\nResident Evil 4 is wall to wall entertainment, bursting with variety and imagination it is silly, scary atmospheric and fun. Key to the tension are finite ammunition and health which much be scavenged for and the deliberately restrictive controls that have you stand your ground to aim and use weapons. If there is one thing we can take from horror franchises in both games and cinema is that repeating the same shtick the same way on account of previous success has drastically diminishing returns especially in a genre that revolves around the unknown. Though the huge success of RE4 as departure in style from the 3 prior games (playing more like a horror themed survival/shooter rather than straight up survival/horror) can be seen as the cause of the unfortunate direction the series has taken since then, judged by itself and not by it's offspring RE4 remains a strong example of how not sticking to an established formula can yield great results.\n\nThe game is easily at its weakest when it is attempting to sew in plot threads from the previous titles which seem a tad convoluted alongside the already highly serviceable 'save the girl beat the baddie' storyline and while the frequent quick time events were new and exciting back then they now may seem a mite gimmicky and annoying to some, personally I still love'em. I've never had much time for periodic cutscenes to advance the story so the prospect of being suddenly off'ed just when you thought it was safe to take a sip of tea will always amuse me.\nThe 'HD' textures go a small way to make up for how aged the game looks and feels at 60fps on high definition monitors but it is neither a selling point or a deal breaker.\n\nIf you've never played RE4 then at £15 it's a great purchase, if you have played it then you probably have either already bought it or a mulling over whether you want to snipe it in a sale. I avoided the prior pc release after all the negative feedback it got as a half arsed port of the inferior ps2 version, but now in all it's glory replete with steam achievements trading cards and the possibility of mods galore I have a great excuse to replay one of my favorite games for what must be the millionth time.\n\n(I love to talk about games, if you have anything to say about my review please say it! And feel free to add me!)",Recommended

"Resident Evil 4, having played the original Gamecube version back in 2005 it's safe to say that this version of the game is a better updated version of Resident Evil 4. This is the first time that Resident Evil 4 is running at 60 fps, which is a nice change compared to the console 30 fps cap. Overall, awesome game if you love Resident Evil 4 and there are a couple of set backs along the way. First, the default controls are very odd and second when your aiming your gun at an enemy Leon's parkinsion's grip of the guns are more noticable than I remember. Great game, I highly recommend this game especially if you haven't played Resident Evil 4 before.",Recommended

Some uber old-school fans dislike it because it started the transition of the series into more of an action oriented game versus a survival-horror, but It's one of the few action games Capcom made the RIGHT way! RE 5, 6, ORC & Revelations have nothing on this game! It's easily the best out of the newer RE series.",Recommended
Massive improvement over the previous version of RES4 although I feel the enviromental textures and lighting and perhaps the poly count of some of the models could use some improvement.

This not only gave even HIGHER RES upgrades when compared to the ""HD"" port, but it also gave things a higher polygon count. The pistol has additional work put towards it. This was a FAN project years ago, and looks better than this ""HD"" port, and Capcom is getting PAID for this.\n\nNo one can seriously stare at me for 10 seconds without laughing after they say: ...\nWhat is there to say, RE4HD is not in HD, \n\nThere exist out of place textures, and floating blood on stuff that's not even from an enemy and was added by developers.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/id/Jeremythellama1/screenshots/?appid=254700&sort=newestfirst&browsefilter=myfiles&view=imagewall#scrollTop=0\n(If this review is over a year old you might need to scroll down a bit)\n\n\n\nFinal verdict.\nConsidering I never cared about HD and only cared about Vsync and 60 FPS, this was perfect.\nThe game is only 20 dollars (NEVER CHANGE THIS UNLESS TO MAKE IT CHEAPER)\n\nThe only thing I asked for from this game is: 1080P, 60FPS, and a good port.\n\nI got all 3, while the ""HD"" Part is a full on lie and even Not Recommended advertising due to not even 1 texture being in HD and only slightly upgraded SD, I can safely say you'll get your money's worth.

"This game has not aged well, and the game has not been ported well to the PC platform.  Keyboard and mouse controls are still awful, and gamepad controls are loose and unresponsive even using a program like x360ce to fool the game into thinking you're using an official Xbox gamepad. \n\nThe textures have mostly just been scaled up to fit the new native widescreen resolutions without actually being improved very much, and the ""locked at 60fps"" and ""locked at 120fps"" options cause a lot of issues in cutscenes, where the sound plays much faster than the video, to the point that the sound will often be five or six seconds ahead of the video.  Additionally, the pre-rendered cutscenes have not been changed since the original 2007 PC port, making the difference between in-game and cutscene very jarring.\n\nWhile this is better than the 2007 PC port, it's still a terrible version of the game and you are still better off buying or renting a used game console if you really want to play RE4 again.",Not Recommended

"The game is very Recommended to the original port. Same gameplay mechanics, etc. Those complaining about not being able to use the mouse to steer have to realise that this is still legacy code. Using mouse to steer would ultimately break the game. That and implementing the mouse in a game using legacy code not built from scratch at the time without conflicting errors can't be easy. That said, the mouse controls when looking around should be several orders of magnitude faster. Thats one gameplay mechanic of the original, to be able to do a quick 90 to aim at someone from the side, that is broken right now. The game takes a second to recognise you want to aim with mouse which can make your stomache turn. Because the original aiming with controller was slow, using the mouse will not feel like a first person shooter and can be a little aggravating, takes getting used to but can be mastered.\nPost processing is terrible. \n30fps is stuttery 30fps whereas the original PC port actually played smoothly (for 30 fps). I find 60FPS feels like it runs too fast, but that could be the smoother animations I'm not used to. \nWhen Leon aims his animation for aiming is way too fast and stuttery. \nThe ""better"" graphics had better not be what you're after because the reality is RE4 is still RE4 no matter which way you look at it. You walk around picking stuff up, shooting zombies, then running from zombies because you're out of health and out of ammo. Taking the time to check out the better textures is a little redundant because the models are the same and it will still feel boxy as opposed to organic. However still much better than the original.\nFMVs look way nicer since they're rendered in game.\n\nAll that being said, I will recommend this game because this is RE4. It is still the same great game. Just wait a bit for a patch or if anyone figures out what the problem is. Is it because v-sync is on amd causing problems that don't make any sense because it is locked at 60? Should we turn v-sync off in the game and turn it on using the hardware? Helped drastically in Dead Space. Don't buy this game until someone has figured out some of the problems or CAPCOM has patched their game.",Recommended

"Resident Evil 4 is arguably the best installment in the franchise, successfully combining the survival-horror elements of 1-3 with a more action lean, without losing its way like 5 & 6 did. Personally, I also think it is the only game to get QTEs down perfectly, as they come in rather unpredictably and punish you severely (often death) if you don't pay attention.\n\nThe story is rather basic; you play as Leon Kennedy, the protagonist of Resi 2, who is now a government agent and has been tasked with rescuing the president's daughter from a religious cult in rural Spain. The starting location, a sprawling village, is the most atmospheric area in the game as you unravel why the daughter has been kidnapped, why the villagers are so hostile, and the sinister intentions of the cult. The game then progresses to a castle area, before finally finishing on a military base.\n\nThe boss fights are rather frequent and varied, requiring a variety of tactics to be defeated from using the environment, to attacking weak spots. The enemies are also varied, from your basic ""zombie"" villagers to a certain, more memorable enemy identified by its raspy breath who often caused downright panic amongst myself and friends.\n\nThe gunplay of the game also took a forward move, from the fixed camera angles of 1-3 to an over-the-shoulder perspective, allowing more accurate and pin point aiming. You earn money (pesatas in weird amounts) from collecting and selling treasure, and as random drops from enemies and boxes/chests. This is used to buy and upgrade a huge variety of weapons, with each having their own unique ""top"" upgrade. For example upgrading a certain shotgun gives it a clip size of 100 (compared to the usual 10-20) shells, and the basic pistol gets a critical headshot boost.\n\nThe game has translated to PC very well, after what was apparently a very poor port previously. You get a fixed rate of 60 FPS (unfortunate that it's fixed, but better than most modern titles) and the option to turn HD textures on and off. The HD textures don't quite hold up to more modern titles, but are far from being horrible to the eye. The mouse and keyboard controls are still fairly poor in my opinion, but the game works very well with a 360 controller, carrying over an identical button layout to the Gamecube version. There hasn't been a complete overhaul, more of an update for HD textures and newer PC set ups, so I find the £15 price to be fair.\n\nI cannot recommend this game enough. It was one of the defining games of my teenage years, and to be able to play it on PC with updated textures is something I was not expecting until it appeared on the Steam database a few weeks ago. RE4 is a truly brilliant action/survival-horror title, and is far superior to 5 & 6. If you have any interest in Resident Evil, or survival-horror games in general, you will almost certainly love this game.\n\n9.5/10",Recommended

The mouse is extremely restricted and slow meaning you can only turn with W,A,S,D and when going into the aim mode there is a delayed mouse response meaning pulling off those quick knee shots is far more difficult. I just don't understand how it could be screwed up this bad when re5 had a great pc port. I recommend waiting for a patch, but if you must play it get a 360 controller.

"Old, fond memories. \nBut that is about it for the experianced Resident Evil fan.\nIf you're new to the Resident Evil franchise, this is a must have. Aside from setting the identity of the horror/action genre for video games since it's release in 2004, its a hell of an intense ride. Amazing atmosphere, amazing gore and guts, and some silly resident evil moments. But for the experianced RE4 gamer, this is just another port. Capcom has dressed it as a huge improvement, and a lot of times you can see it, but you don't feel it much at least. The controls for the Keyboard are slightly clunky, and (of course) for today's standards, some of the visuals/animations don't entirely stand up anymore. And as far as I can tell, the most they have added is a leaderboard to see who ran past the most ganados to beat the top time of completion.\nThose aside, it is a great nostalgic peice of terror, if it even can scare you any more. Worth a buy if you havn't played it, and maybe worth a buy if you have the cash laying around for the veteran.",Recommended

"To me, this is one of the best games of all time. Very intense atmosphere, addictive gameplay, exciting boss fights, a lot of unlockables, and much more! I've already played through the previous PC version 4 times unlocking basically everything several years ago. I can't describe the feeling of getting more and more powerful with each playthough and the fun just grows stronger and stronger. I'm planning to have a few playthoughs of this new high res version. I want to at least unlock Thompson and rocket launcher, infinite ammo, and of course all the custumes.\n\nAlthough the previous PC port sucked and crashed on me every couple of hours, It couldn't stop me playing this amazing game! I managed to complete the Ada adventure, in which you cannot save. What happened was I played half way though, then it crash and I had to restart the adventure. I did this over and over again until I finished the adventure quick enough before it crashed on me again. This is how good the game is - even with crashing I still stuck to the very end.\n\nMercenary mode is good too. Although it's not as good as the Mercenary mode in RE6, it all started from this game. So there is no reason not to give credit to it.\n\nThis game is woth every cent it asks for. Stop reading reviews and get it NOW!",Recommended

"Great game, compared to my old ps2 copy, the pc version is much better, although the wonky controls still exist, you can get used to it very fast. One thing to note is that if your pc can't run at a constant 60 fps then you will experience slow downs which feels like slow mo, since the game was coded so that actions follow fps, slower fps means slower action. And the game only runs smooth at 30 or 60 fps.\n\nIf you like the resident evil franchise then you should definitely pick this up as it pioneered the 3rd person view in re4.",Recommended
"Fans of the Wii version should steer well clear of this one, waited for a long time for this and although it looks and runs beautifully (better than any other system I've had it on infact), the control system for mouse and keyboard, that should really work as well as the Wii version is totally counter intuative, never been so disapointed, begging for updates and maybe so more options for personal config :(\nPlaying this on pc is just like playing it on any other system but now you have to wear oven gloves!",Not Recommended
"EDIT: I have since re-done this review, because the game received a patch back in April.  Since then it has become much, much more playable.\n\nCHANGES:\n--There exists now a ""modern"" mode which fixes the clunky, unresponsive mouse controls, making them much more smooth and fast.  (Also in classic, the unresponsiveness has been fixed, but the sensitivity is much lower than it would be in modern)\n--A and D are still used for actually TURNING.  This is an intended feature, however, and the game is balanced around it.  You get used to it, eventually.  You can use the mouse to free-look quite well, while not aiming.  \n--The quick-turn button still isn't always responsive, but you have to hold S and then press Shift for it to recognize the input.  Q can also initiate a quick-turn.\n\nThere is still a problem with the low FoV, but it's an intended feature much like the tank control turning.\n\nThe game is now much more playable for mouse + keyboard input.  I p̶l̶a̶y̶e̶d̶ died for 6 hours straight the day before I wrote this.  Very fun.\n\n\n------------------------\nOLD, OUTDATED REVIEW WRITTEN BY SOME STUPID NERD (me):\n------------------------\n\nThe game itself is great, no one will dispute that.  However, this port, I found, isn't very friendly to M&KB:\n\n--I had to move my mouse across my desk at least 4 times to do a complete 360 (This is at maximum sensitivity)\n--You can't steer with just M&KB, you have to use just the keyboard for turning (A and D to turn left & right.. but you get used to it)\n--There is significant delay for actions sometimes.  For example, when you pull out your knife and go to swing it at someone (using the keyboard), it takes about a second for the game to recognize that you're actually moving your mouse.\n--The quick-turn button (shift + S) doesn't always recognize your inputs, so times when I wanted to turn around to start actually defending myself, I couldn't.  I couldn't, because I ended up tapping the keys about 3 times, and all Leon did was backpedal a little.\n--The mouse is vastly inferior to the controller for this game, because all too often, the game hinders the use of the mouse by slowing it down to stupid levels.  I don't know why they didn't just use the code for the mouse that they used for RE5 (for aiming, general movement, ect).\n\nI get that the game is supposed to feel ""clunky,"" because after all, it IS a survival horror game.  SURVIVAL, combat is not supposed to be easy.  However, that doesn't mean it has to be broken for mouse input.  If you're not entirely sure what I mean by this, imagine the mouse controls for the original Dead Space on PC.  It can be that bad at times.\n\nOn top of this, while I was playing (about 25 minutes in) I started to get HORRIBLE FPS drops.  In the top right of my screen, apparently the game kept queueing up a download for the art book and soundtrack.. but.. kept downloading them over, and over, and over again, while I was playing?  I got about 5-10 FPS at this point, when before I was getting 60 without drops.  Don't get me wrong, from a technical standpoint, this game is pretty rock solid when it comes to performance.  This was the only performance hitch I got.\n\nSpecs:\ni7 2600k @ 3.4 GHz \nGTX 770 @ 4 GB \n12 GB DDR3 RAM",Recommended
"Following the previous (and absolutely terrible) PC port, Capcom has decided to give us PC a second try. All-in-all, this story had a far happier ending. The graphics look good. Not fantastic, as they're simply the same textures as previous installments upscaled to a higher resolution, but definitely nicer than the PS2 or Gamecube versions. There's actually NATIVE MOUSE SUPPORT, which works well enough (though it could certainly be more responsive)\n\nProbably the biggest nuisance this game brings to modern PC gamers is the control setup. Yes, it still utilizes the tank controls of old. You have wasd controls, but a/d TURN you rather than making you strafe. The mouse DOES NOT MAKE YOU TURN. It only rotates the camera and moves your weapon in aiming mode. This will feel extremely awkward at first, but it WILL feel better after time. If you can't stand it, though, then I would recommend using a gamepad. Tank controls are always more intuitive on a gamepad.\n\nIn the end, this is exactly what you'd expect it to be, unless you're expecting yet another muddy and cruddy port. Finally, we PC gamers get to experience RE4 as it's meant to be, rather than as a broken mess.\n\nPS: Some people are complaining about their game playing in slow motion. This is due to the fixed framerate. If your computer can't handle the game at 60fps, it will slow the game in order to keep that framerate. The quickest fix is to lower the framerate setting to fixed 30fps (unfortunately, there is no current way to unlock the fps).",Recommended
"I do recommend this game but the Devs have lied about it being HD it's the same textures as the gamecube verson only some tiny changes where made to key ingame textures thats it, and the controls are rubbish, keyboard and mouse keys are a mess and will get you killed most of the time and using a 360 controller takes a while to get used to,\n\nI give this game a rating of 5/10 is a great game but both PC ports ""Steam and Retail"" are shite would recommend the gamecube or PS2 verson of the game!!!",Recommended

"A serviceable port. The added ability to finally play RE4 in 60 frames per second is nice, but it breaks a lot of things. \n\nPhysics react twice as fast, certain particle effects are clearly still running at 30 fps which is jarring, and the incendiary grenade effects last half as long for whatever reason. Basically any game logic tied to the frame rate kind of goes nuts at 60 fps, but so far this seems to only be visual things and nothing like game speed.\n\nGraphics are nice, but not really any better than emulating the Wii version on Dolphin at the same resolution with a fan made texture pack. The PC version also seems to have a warm tone to the colors, it's kind of unfitting. The Wii/GCN versions have a cooler, more blueish color temperature and it suits the game much better. \n\nAudio quality is also weaker in comparison to the Wii/GCN versions, and the positional audio in the PC version is pretty bad. In the Wii version you could easily tell exactly where an enemy was due to the excellent positional audio, but in the PC version everything sounds muddled and there's no real sense of direction to any of the sound. The overall audio is at least slightly better than the horribly compressed 360/PS3 HD versions.\n\nOverall not a really bad port, but not great either. Better than the original Ubisoft PC port, and I'd say it's better than the 360/PS3 HD versions as well. Still doesn't beat emulating the Wii version on Dolphin at 1080p, but even that's not perfect with slowdowns in a few key places and weird audio skipping. Also the achievements are sad, nothing for Mercs, no fun achievements like ""beat the game with only the pistol"", no speed run achievements, etc. Boooooo Capcom.",Recommended

"Updating this review to reflect that I have found a solution for my problems, which was that this game was using the Integrated Graphics on my system by default instead of the high-performance graphics card. I was able to fix the slowdown issues by changing the settings in the nvidia control panel as instructed in the forums for this game.\n\nNow that that's fixed, this game is a much better version for the PC than the original port. Resident Evil 4 remains perhaps the best entry in the Resident Evil series to date. The controls feel a little clunky compared to newer entries like RE 5 and 6, but that's not really a fault of this updated vrersion.\n\nAll that said, Capcom still needs to patch this game to be aware of cards that have the dual-mode feature.

"Resident Evil 4, since its release, has been one of my favorite games of all time. In fact, it is probably tied with Ocarina of Time as my favorite game of all time. I played and beat the original on the gamecube hundreds of times, and I could not miss out on the opportunity to finally play it on my PC. My experience thus far with this port has been nothing short of fantastic. It is the same game I fell in love with a decade ago, but with a few neat bells and whistles to spruce it up. The HD looks good, but can be jarring at first, since I was very accustomed to the gritty looking old graphics. The sharpened look of everything actually may even make things look even faker than they used to, but it never detracts from the experience. The only real annoyance I have had is an inability to fully customize the controls for a gamepad. I have become very set in my ways using a gamecube controller, and some of the button mapping (while making sense) is just not for me. I keep pushing Y to go to my item screen, and keep pressing X to run. It will take a very long time to retrain myself, since the old controls are second nature/habit for me, and I wish I could just map them as I wish and do away with that learning curve. Other than this, the game seems flawless to me. I have encountered no bugs or performance issues, and have been enjoying this playthrough.",Recommended

It is the same Resi 4 as before and it is still as good, if that is what you want then I recomend it. \nMouse and keyboard is totaly playable, there is full mouse suport in the menus and gameplay but not in the save/load screen or the inventory. The inventory in this port is annoying overall; backspace to pick up items, page down to rotate, Tab does back out of some menus but not others.  \n\nThis is a much better PC port than the last one but there are some technical problems it has. The games run speed seems to be tied to the FPS, which defaults to 60. Any lower and the game runs noticably slower. FPS drops to about 40 during rainy/water filled areas.\nHaving any kind of post prossesing or AA will drop your framerate by a small amount. The game will look much smoother if you turn these options off. I suggest you turn off AA anyway as it appears to put a grain filter over the whole game while its active.\n\nOverall I think if you want resi 4 again and can put up with the technical issues go ahead and buy it, if you cant overlook these problems or have a low end machine that will struggle to run it at full res 60 FPS then you should probably avoid this port.",Recommended

That alone is worth the preorder price, now with HD textures, KB+M support (I use Xbox controller though), Steamworks features, it doesn't get any better than this.",Recommended
"Where do I start? Been playing this game as a little kid, got excited when I first got it when I was 10 on the GameCube. Since then, I've played it about 10+ Rounds, and has been my favorite GC game, back when I played on Consoles.  I saw it the first day it was available on Steam, and I didn't think twice about buying it. 9.5/10 Must Have.",Recommended
"Soooooo... I'm not sure if anyone else is noticing this... but... The sniper rifle is acting up. Everything except the sniper rifle has 60 fps animations. If you reload, you'll notice that Leon is strangely jittery while everyone and everything else is smooth, and it looks weird. Capcom, please patch this, it took me right out of the game as far as immersion goes. I love this game and own 4 versions of it (PC (original and rerelease), PS2, and Xbox 360) and would like this version to be my definitive version.",Recommended
"Buyer Beware.  \n\nThe game lacks keyboard and mouse controls.\nThe 360 controls are also very poor, and not configurable, save for 3 default choices.\n60fps?  Yes the cut scenes.

This is nothing more than a shameful skid mark ofthe memory of a great game.  This game should be removed off of steam, until they fix the issues.\n",Not Recommended
"Ahh this game. One of my all time favorites and is absolutely timeless. It is one of the most tense experiences EVER as far as video games go. Very dark and disturbing, Incredibly Immersive and amazing frantic survival horror/action gameplay. It is also considered by some to be the high point of this amazing series. You probably know all this already. What you may not know is how great this port is. looks down right GORGEOUS in 1080p at 60 frames a second with brand new HD textures. Also surprised at how well this plays on keyboard and mouse as well. Just... buy this game. If you have never played it, treat yourself to one of the greatest games in gaming history.",Recommended
"A classic that EVERY gamer needs to play. Either the Original 2005 GameCube release or any other console or this new release. You MUST play it.\nIt's, without a doubt, a cult classic.\n\nDespite the hate from some people, this is BY FAR the BEST version of them all. It has ALL the features from the GameCube version (This includes Shaders/BumpMaping) + All the exclusive PS2 Features + tweaks exclusive to the PC version, like: Higher Resolution, Higer fps Rate, Mouse and Keyboard support (Unlike the 2007 version, which only supported Keyboard or a PAD), better sound quality, faster loading times, cloud saving, an High Definition texture pack and I can go on and on.\n\nThe controls can be argued as ""awkward"". They are ""tank like"" just like the preivous games. But, you'll eventually get used to them. The game is balanced around them, so, if Capcom changes them, they will have to re-balance the whole game. The idea here is that the player gets to play the original with a ""new face"".\n\nWith this refresh, the game stills holds up pretty well. You have to remember, it was released in 2005 on a console that was in its EOL.\n\n\nI can't thank Capcom enough for Re-Releasing this game in a format that I can enjoy.\n\nI hope you guys release the rest of the Saga: 1, 2 and 3, Code Veronica X and RE 5 Gold. Because you know that people will buy it. I will for sure.\n\nThank you, Capcom.\nThank you, Steam user for reading this humble review.",Recommended
"Excellent. Not perfect, but excellent. Capcom delivers with this port. If you liked Resident Evil 5 or 6, this is a must buy.\n\nSome people may cite it lacking certain graphical elements, however in spite of this the game looks great. Arguably the effects will be missed, but going back to the Wii version won't feel the same without HD and 60fps.\n\nUltimately, this PC port shows that Resident Evil 4 has aged remarkably well. Though it will never be a COD or a BF, we need to remember that it was never meant to be. One of the godfathers of ""over-the-shoulder"" 3rd person shooter, this port of RE4 brings the masterpiece to PC gamers and sharpens features that were sadly lacking in the PS3/360 HD ports.",Recommended
"Capcom must patch this game. I tried to play this game but Leon ends up shooting all over the place and theres nothing i could do. I tried to aim at the enemy but Leon aims behind him instead of the enemy right in front of him. I love RE4 back when it came out for Nintendo Gamecube but this is too much, i can't get past the first chapter without it being stupid.. The game also goes slow motion and the lip syncing is really bad when its in slow motion and i know i'm not the only one experiencing this problem. I want to recommend this game but as of right now i'd say dont buy it unless a patch is released fixing these problems. :/",Not Recommended

"Beat the old PC version many times, I would say that this remake sure has some huge jump in graphical detail. The rendering and color tone is still similar, but high quality textures as well as the 60 FPS do make the game look way more smooth and polished than the original PC release. I applied 60 FPS mod also enhanced texture, even ENB profile to the old PC release, and I don't think it look as good as this. I am really satisfied with this game even though it costed 20 bucks. The in engine cutscenes was what I desired for a long time. Only down part for me is that, I am really used to the keyboard control in the old release(might sound silly), but since this game is semi keyboard/mouse and does not let you to go full keyboard, I have to learn the controlling mechanism again(not a bad thing at all for newer players though).",Recommended
"One of the best games of all time! I had so much fun with this game back when it came out. I was so happy to see that there's a native pc port of this game with hd textures and new game engine for steam. This is one of the best survival horror games; if not, the best of all survival horror games, period. The controls with the keyboard and mouse is surprisingly good and so is the controllers controls as well. The graphics is still one of the most stylish looking games, the hd textures are pretty good looking. I had to stand around certain objects and just go ""wow, that texture..."". I personally can't wait for what modders will do with the graphics in the future. The sound quality sounds a lot better and clearer than the previous pc port or the consoles version (excluding the ps3/360 port). The cutscenes are real-time and looks great in 60 fps, I have decided to just watch all the cutscenes again, now that it's in HD, 60fps, and has subtitles as well. The gameplay is amazing to this game, I still think that the gameplay is better than most games I have played in the past few years. I totally recommend this game for any pc gamer both new and returning players to this game. This is the best way to bring back your good memories of this game. Any new players will very much enjoy this game as well.",Recommended

"i really wanted to like this game but the controls just don't quite cut it.  using A and D to turn feels very un-intuitive, and for my keyboard, i can't even turn right while running (shift+W+D doesn't register as a command or something).  plays fine on a controller except for the fact that you can't change the stick sensitivity.  i know it just came out, but it's kind of disappointing that they took the time to add in HD textures and improve the frame rate (both things that didn't have much bearing on the game experience in the first place) but not update the controls to be more in tune with other PC games.  i don't doubt that this can be fixed in a future patch or update, but for the time being this is not a great port of the game.  :(",Not Recommended

"Originally released for the GameCube in 2005 and now bringing all its glory to Pc/Steam users in HD and smoothness 60 fps.\n\nEvery now and then a game comes along that within the first minute of playing it you know it's going to be something truly special. To say that Resident Evil 4 is the greatest thing to happen to survival-horror games in 2005 and... since it's creation is a bold statement and one that can be backed up by the quality of the game at hand. Resident Evil 4 is the end all, be all that the genre has strived for since its inception and is a fond love letter not just to fans of action or survival-horror but to people that simply like to play games.\n\nFrenetic action and giant boss battles aside, where Resident Evil 4 succeeds, as a survival-horror game isn't so much that it's a frightening game, though there are moments where you will be scared, but its haunting atmosphere. Resident Evil 4 will send chills through your spine as its atmosphere takes center stage against seemingly impossible odds as you go off in search of the President's daughter. The game has the right feel to it, it does have it's action go to the forefront as it's greatest strength but it never lets the action get in the way of the atmosphere and the mood. The two combine together to make Resident Evil 4 one of the most masterful games ever made and an example of how to do the genre justice without abandoning what makes it a survival-horror game.\n\nYou will be lost in Resident Evil 4's game world for at least twenty hours and you will be compelled to play through it again, either on harder difficulties or with all of your previous items in tow for the second go around. The game is truly fantastic and is well worth a purchase today for those who have never played it if only to see how it's influenced games like Dead Space and Gears of War in different ways.\n\nOverall: Whether you're a fan of Resident Evil, the survival-horror genre, action games, adventure games or simply good games, Resident Evil 4 has all the bases covered. This is the kind of game that comes along once in a console-generation and it needs to be experienced. It's a bold statement to call a game one of the all time greatest ever made but I can make that claim with Resident Evil 4 and have no reservations about it.",Recommended

I believe that the original RE4's graphics still hold up due to some great art and design, but the constant 60 FPS (which make a VERY noticeable difference), improved textures and the fact that cutscenes aren't pre-rendered anymore mean that this time it's actually enjoyable.\n\nIf I were to complain about something, it would be that you can't customize the controls, just pick from a few presets, and having to shoot with X (on the Xbox pad) feels super weird.",Recommended

"(TLDR? This review is also available in video format if you scroll down.)\n\nNine years have passed since Resident Evil 4’s initial release on the GameCube and it still holds up quite well. It’s a massively influential game that helped pioneer the third person shooter genre as well as completely changed the face of survival horror.\n\nYou’ll once again fill the shoes of Leon Kennedy as he searches for the President's missing daughter, Ashley, in a remote area of Spain. She’s being held by a mysterious cult, known as the Los Illuminados who are utilizing a mind-controlling parasite called Las Plagas in order to gain power. The village that Leon first comes across is filled with infected townsfolk aptly named Ganado or “herd” in English, who are hell-bent on stopping Leon. \n\nResident Evil 4 continues the tradition of offering an eccentric and ridiculous narrative that successfully links some of the franchise's biggest characters to its events but also stands well enough on its own that newcomers are not left scratching their heads.\n\nThe controls are solid and responsive but may feel somewhat strange to those that are accustomed to modern third person shooters. Leon is unable to move and shoot at the same time and must remain stationary when aiming. The camera also obscures a lot of your surroundings, adding to the overall tension and horror.\n\nWhen it comes to the gameplay and combat, the Plagas-infected enemies present a satisfying challenge. They will relentlessly pursue Leon, often trying to flank him. Removing an enemies’ head will often just allow the Plagas themselves to emerge and engage Leon directly or swing around from the host’s neck. The enemies react appropriately to each wound, dropping their weapons or stumbling rewarding your aim with purpose and control. Shield bearing cult members and blind mutants with massive claws that must be dispatched by killing the parasites on their backs also refresh the enemy roster. Several satisfying boss fights provide the cherry on top of the Resident Evil 4 gameplay experience. It also features a great inventory management and upgrade system, allowing you to customize various weapons to suit your play style.\n\nThe greater focus on action does mean that scares are less frequent than they were in previous entries. Wandering around a hedge maze with Plagas infested wolves waiting to jump out of bushes and seeking keys whilst being pursued by wheezing, seemingly unstoppable regenerators are some of Resident Evil 4's few terrifying highlights during its three acts. While the first two acts are brilliantly executed, the third act loses a bit of momentum at parts, focusing more on action opposed to horror. This handful of minor grimace worthy moments is largely lost amidst the rest of the experience which will take most players fifteen or more hours on their first playthrough.\n\nAs if the main campaign wasn't long enough, Assignment Ada offers additional content as a mini game through the third act where you collect five samples of the Las Plagas parasite. Mercenaries mode challenges players to survive and kill as many enemies as possible. It's an addictive mode that would go on to become a staple of the franchise by enticing players with a risk/reward system, stringing together kills gives players a multiplier and breaking hourglasses extends the time of the session, providing a greater opportunity to post a high score.  It’s a challenging variant on the gameplay that requires mastery of each stage to unlock further content and rewards. With these additional modes, it's really easy to get thirty hours of entertainment from Resident Evil 4. If that’s not enough, there’s also a Separate Ways campaign which acts as a mini scenario B filling in Ada’s perspective of the story with new bosses, viewpoints and a new area to complete substantially fleshing out the story.\n\nThe muted, earth tone rich Spanish village that serves as Resident Evil 4's setting is a massive departure from the dark, claustrophobic and sinister mansion from the first game and the post-apocalyptic city scape of the second and third games. When it was first released, Resident Evil 4 was one of the most impressive graphical showcases of the Playstation 2 and Gamecube. With a 1080p resolution, a frame rate of 60 FPS and some rescaled textures, Resident Evil 4 looks better than ever. It still looks its age but is still capable of impressing. The atmosphere is as rich in 2014 as it was in 2005 but it's still the same game and some low-res textures can be found.\n\nResident Evil 4 is a bittersweet experience, along with Half-Life 2, it helped foreshadow what was to come with new hardware as well as perfectly reinvigorating and updating a franchise that was in danger of losing its appeal as new hardware changed gamers expectations. In doing so however, Resident Evil 4 shifted the franchise's inertia toward action and with the next couple installments; Resident Evil would almost entirely forsake its horror roots. With the death of Resident Evil as a horror game, much of the survival horror genre fell into mediocrity with Dead Space being one of the few titles to successfully straddle the line between action and horror before becoming a victim of the same fate. \n\nResident Evil 4 is one of the greatest games of the new millennium. It maintained enough of the elements of its predecessors to be identifiable as a Resident Evil game while otherwise reinventing the franchise. Its timeless gameplay, great art direction and mostly excellent bosses make it very playable almost a decade after its original release. If you haven't played Resident Evil 4, now is as good a time as any.\n\n\nTLDR? This review is also available in video format (I did the editing while my friend Josh handled the voice over):\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv0UuIVS9Nw\n\nWe also had a two hour discussion on Resident Evil after playing Resident Evil 6. We cover things like our favorite moments from the franchise as well as what changes we’d like to see in the future:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I243Zqf64bU\n\nPros:\n\n+ A solid port, Resident Evil 4 looks better than ever at 1080p and 60FPS. \n+ Amazing gameplay & enemy reactions\n+ Excellent Atmosphere & Environments\n+ Fantastic inventory and upgrade system\n+ Good balance of horror and action\n+ Great additional content\n\nCons:\n\n- Somewhat weaker third act\n- Irritating Ashley AI\n- The beginning of the end (The success of Resident Evil 4 lead to the franchise shifting more towards the action side of things.)\n\n\nNote: A controller is strongly recommended. It also seems that quite a few people with AMD/ATI Processors and video cards have been experiencing some slow-down. I haven't had any technical difficulties running the game but I'm running an Intel I5 3570k and a GTX560TI. I imagine this issue will be patched shortly though for those experiencing it.\n\nOverall, Resident Evil 4 is a solid port and a must play. The 60 FPS is actually extremely noticeable when compared to the Xbox 360 and PS3 HD releases of the game, making it feel smoother than ever.\n\n\nIf you enjoyed this review, feel free to follow me as a Steam Curator: http://store.steampowered.com/curator/4886473/",Recommended

"Yes, it looks dated, yes, the controls are a bit clunky, but yes, it's still a classic. Resident Evil 4 is still a tense, unsettling game. Ammunition is scarce and the 'zombies' are plentiful, sporting dungarees and looking like refugees from the 'Deliverance' movie. Maybe this is what happened to Dexy's Midnight Runners since they split up. The lack of guns and bullets make you ponder your next move, and wishing you could collect more pairs of underpants, rather than whistling as you work your way through the hordes with an AK-47. You can pick off a batch of them from a distance with a sniper rifle, only to turn a corner and find a gang of them high-tailing after you. And they aren't even zombies, they are disgruntled nutcases, another unwanted gift from the ever-shady 'Umbrella' corporation. These unpleasant chaps and erm 'ladies' shout at you in a sort of unintelligable lingo. They love their pitchforks, axes, dynamite sticks, and huge boulders which they roll down hills at you. Fortunately they are less than proficient at throwing dynamite, often blowing themselves up if you stand on higher ground. But watch out for the array of booby traps scattered about. Trip-wire and bear-traps are popular. And if you run out of bullets, you had better perfect your knife slicing technique or these raving loons might just make sandwiches out of you. Resident Evil 4 sent the survival horror genre off in a whole new direction when it was released about a thousand years ago, and it would have been nice to see the game reimagined for next-gen, but the difference between the HD version and the original does seem only cosmetic. The game deserves more than just the lick of paint it gets here, but it's still as gripping an experience as it ever was. \n\n9/10 (As scored in 1861, when I had a Gamecube)",Recommended

"The story takes place 6 years after the Raccoon City incident where a viral outbreak happened by a company called Umbrella. You are Leon S. Kennedy one of the survivors of the incident. Now hired by the government as an high-ranking officer, he is sent to rescue the kidnapped Daughter of the president, Ashley Graham. While searching you will encounter alot of enemies and uncover an evil plot that could change the face of the world as we know it. \nThe environments in this game are good-rendered and retain a singular ""spooky"" ambiance throughout. The character models are clear and crisp, with minimal faults in animation.\nThe music suits the game, it flows well with the ambiance of each area. Sound effects are well-done also.\nResident Evil 4 takes around 10-15 hours to complete. After you have completed the main game you are rewarded with three extra game modes. Separate Ways serves to delve deeper into the plotline of the game, taking you deeper into the story and showing the player that not everything that occurs throughout is coincidental. Assignment Ada plays much like the main game as well. The Mercenaries is a mini game where the player has to kill enemies to earn points before the evacuation chopper arrives in the allotted time. \nBy completing these extra game modes, weapons become available in the main game and Separate Ways, coercing the player into numerous replays in order to obtain all of them.\nIf you do not already own Resident Evil 4, I can highly recommend that you buy it.

"If you are reading this review because you are unsure if Resident Evil 4 is a good game, AND you are the owner of a monster spec PC, then stop reading, buy the game and enjoy it because it is amazing. However, if you are concerned about the PC port, keep reading.\n\nAt the time of writing this review, only the actual PC port was tested. Firstly, it is MUCH better then the original RE4 port however it is not perfect. \n\nThere are a few options which are pointless because they cripple your view. Motion blur makes you feel like you are drunk and the post-processing adds a black and white film-grainy filter to it. It is 3 different colours and it makes the game look worse. \n\nAlso on my AMD R7 250, I could not run the game in 60FPS on 1080p however it ran fine on 720p with the occassional drop. Yes this could be because my card is not amazing but what I am saying is that maybe it could be optimised to run at 60FPS better on lower end systems. Not everyone owns a monster-spec PC though Capcom! \n\nThe game has 2 frame rate settings, 60 and 30. If your computer cannot handle 60 then the frame rate will drop to 30 and because the FPS is connected to the speed, it will half the speed. The default settings reset button seems to be accurate enough though when it comes to optimising the game for you, which is a first!\n\nFinally, the mouse controls work fine however you cannot use the mouse in the inventory. Not a big deal but its fine. The game is still RE4 alright though and it is clear that it was taken seriously that the game was going to be ported. Keep in mind that you probably will need a high-end GPU in order to play 1080p/60FPS. \n\nOverall, Capcom has done a good job but there is still room for future performance patches to improve performance on lower end cards like my R7 250. However, I can report that overclocking my R7 250 ,which more-or-less increases the quality of the card so it is equal to the 7750, makes it run fine with AA off. Final verdict, the port is great.",Recommended
"Do I really even need to write something here? Alright, if you insist.\n\nI reckon most of you are already familiar with this title from one of the previous releases. For those who aren't, well let's just say the trailer didn't lie about it being one of the highest rated games in history. Even if it has been nine years now, it still manages to retain the entertainment aspect. Speaking of this port in particular however, it is a much needed improvement over the previous release. The only thing I was disappointed with was that mouse aim isn't exactly responsive or so you will think when you first attempt to play the game while making use of a mouse. But truth is it just takes some time to get used to. If it was done any other way the game would be far too easy considering the nine year old AI's capabilities or more precisely lack of such.\n\nBut here's what you really are reading this for...\n[u]As far as ports go everything is top notch in terms of technical execution![/u]\nJust as with all the previous Resident Evil ports that have been done by Capcom themselves.\n\nEDIT: Turns out the issue with the 60 FPS arose from the fact that it had used my integrated card which I didn't even consider because the game was running perfectly fine unless switched to 60 FPS. So basically if you experience issues with the 60 FPS setting, then just make sure it is actually using your high performance video card.",Recommended
